{"content": "Ronald McDonald, that cheeseburger-slinging maestro of McFlurries, has a completely different identity in Japan. Okay, so it's not that different, but after searches for \"What is Ronald McDonald called in Japan?\" spiked in Google searches today, we had to know: What is he called? And is this just another internet hoax-turned-headline?!\nTurns out, it's true. It's not like he's assuming a new identity, forced into the Big Mac Protection Program after too many run-ins with the Hamburglar. In Japan, he's very much the same McDonald you see in the States: Same red hair, same ketchup-and-mustard-colored garb, even down to the same last name. The only change is that in Japan, he's Donald McDonald, or rather, Donarudo Makudonarudo. Similarly, the chain's charity, the Ronald McDonald House, is known as the Donald McDonald House there. \n\nThis decision was made back in 1971, when a businessman who helped open the country's first Mickey D's suggested the swap, deeming it easier to pronounce, according to Business Insider.

Ronald McDonald in Japanese is Ronarudo Makudonarudo, and having the \"Ro\" sound so close to the \"ru\" sound would trip people up, because the very similar \u2014 yet different \u2014 sounds don't quite roll off the tongue, the site argues. Plus, Japanese audiences were already familiar with \"Donarudo,\" thanks to Donald Duck's popularity when the chain opened there, so it was a more natural fit. ",  "id": "7"}

Once setup is complete and the delivery location has been registered, customers can shop on Amazon.com and select the \u201cIn-Car\u201d delivery option at checkout.\nOn delivery day, the Amazon Key App lets customers check if they\u2019ve parked within range of the delivery location, and provides notifications with the expected 4-hour delivery time window. The App also notifies customers when the delivery is on its way, and the package has been delivered. Customers can track when their car was unlocked and relocked in the App\u2019s activity feed, and rate their in-car delivery.\n\u201cSince launching Amazon Key last November, we\u2019ve safely delivered everything from cameras to collectable coins inside the home. Customers have also told us they love features like keyless guest access and being able to monitor their front door from anywhere with the Amazon Key App,\u201d said Peter Larsen, Vice President of Delivery Technology, Amazon. \u201cIn-car delivery gives customers that same peace of mind and allows them to take the Amazon experience with them.

Support for even more vehicle makes and models will be added over time.\n\u201cUnlocking Amazon Key In-Car delivery for more than 7 million Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac owners is another great example of how we are leveraging the embedded connectivity in our vehicles to provide our customers with services that make their ownership experience more valuable,\u201d said Alan Batey, president, General Motors North America.\nAmazon uses multiple layers of verification to ensure the security of in-car deliveries. Each time a delivery driver requests access to a customer\u2019s vehicle, Amazon verifies that an authorized driver is at the right location with the right package, through an encrypted authentication process. Once this process is successfully completed, the car is then unlocked. Customers receive a notification via the Amazon Key App after the delivery is completed and the vehicle is relocked. No special codes or keys are ever provided to delivery drivers. For added peace of mind, in-car delivery is backed by Amazon\u2019s Happiness Guarantee.\n\u201cSimplification of experience for our consumers is central to Volvo\u2019s digital vision. Receiving a package securely and reliably in your car, without you having to be there, is something we think many people will appreciate. Our partnership with Amazon now makes this possible for a majority of our customers in the US,\u201d said Atif Rafiq, Chief Digital Officer at Volvo Cars. \u201cThis intersection between transportation and commerce could very well be the next wave of innovation, and we intend to be at the forefront.\u201d\nIn addition to enabling in-car delivery, Amazon Key is a smart entry solution that offers customers keyless entry, remote lock and unlock, and guest access, as well as the option to have packages delivered inside the home.\nTo check eligibility and to sign up for Amazon Key In-Car, visit www.amazon.com/keyincar.\n \n\nRelated Topics:Amazon, Amazon Key In-Car\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",  "id": "15"}

Meet an abandoned kitten who for a year has been going every day to the same place where his owners left when they moved out of the house.It's sad to hear stories like this. Even so, we believe that they can help raise awareness among those who think about abandoning an animal.The story of the abandoned kitten in RussiaMany compare it with stories of animals that have been in the tombs of their owners for years. The truth is that this reality is more cruel, because the abandonment has been voluntary and not forced.This cat was seen running behind the car of its owners in Russia when they decided to move house and leave the animal alone and to their fate in the neighborhood in which they had lived all their lives.Despite his career, the family ignored his silent pleas and left the poor kitten abandoned. In spite of everything, his hopes did not falter and he hoped that his family, those for whom he would have been willing to give his life, would seek him again ... But that never happened.That's why the neighbors have seen how this abandoned kitten has gone day after day to the same place waiting for its owners to return. The neighbors have fed it. This is a sign of human kindness, contrary to the evil of the owners of the animal.The abandoned kitten tells us how he feltIt is winter, it is very cold where we live, but I do not know why, my owner has insisted that we go out. They have always been very good to me. I have to be grateful obeying and fulfilling your wishes.Therefore, I go out. It seems that they put boxes in the car, it is nothing new to me, they have been doing it for several days. This place is ugly, there are many cars. I like it better when they take me where there are trees and children playing, but what more can I ask than to have someone who loves me?I see how everyone climbs in the car, wait, where do they go? I have to follow them! Eyyy no, do not leave without me. Maybe they have not realized that I'm here, maybe they just went to take some things somewhere and come back.Yes, that must be. I will sit here to wait for you. It seems that they do not come ... It's getting dark, I'd better take a nap.And my family\u2026?Wow, the sun rises and there is no trace of my family. I'm hungry, what could I eat? I'll go around It seems that something smells somewhere. It does not smell very good, but I imagine it will be better than going hungry. It's cold, I'm hungry and there's a lot of dirt around here, how I'd like to be at home!I miss my bed and my blanket, the one that warmed me on cold days like this. Maybe my family will arrive soon. In the meantime I'll go around here so they can see me when they come back.It seems that today they will not return either, perhaps they have entertained themselves with something, I will continue here in case tomorrow they appear ...I've been here for many days, all the neighbors have become my friends. They feed me and that is more than enough for me, but I would like it so much that my family will remember that I am here, waiting for them, because I have never stopped loving them and if some day they decide to return, I will continue here, wishing to see them.The abandonment affects the animals in a very negative way, because they are abandoned to their fate, unable to feed themselves, cover themselves, drink or keep clean.

{"content": "Making more money is a great thing. But sometimes finding a better-paid job is not an option, even if it is temporarily. That doesn't mean that we cannot save more than we normally do. By incorporating this simple trick into your everyday life, you'll be able to save more money and much faster. It will require some discipline and a little bit of sacrifice, but it's easier than it sounds. And this is what you should do every night before going to bed. There are two categories you'll need to update every night, cash and bank card. So let's assume that by the end of the day, you have $287 in cash and $1556 on your card. You should simply subtract the last digits from both categories, making them end in zero. That way $287 will now be $280 in your wallet, and those extra $7 will now be your savings. Do the same thing with your card. Some days you'll save $2 from both categories, some days you'll save about $18 per day. If you can go one step further, you can do the same thing with the last two digits, instead of just one. But have in mind that some days you could be having up to $99 to zero out. That's impossible for most people. And those who can afford it don't even need this trick for saving money. Instead, you can go up to $15 or whatever feels right. So let's assume you have $113 in your wallet, you can go two ways. The first option is to save $3, leaving $110 in your wallet, or you can save $13, because your two-digits limit is $15. Open a savings account and transfer everything that you saved from both categories. That way you won't be tempted to spend it. It's easier to save money one day at the time. It's s much easier than it sounds and it only takes a couple of minutes to do it. This routine will also do wonders for your discipline. Try it and see how much you'll save in just one month.",  "id": "24"}

{"content": "In our years of working with couples, we\u2019ve seen three major happiness saboteurs over and over again. Think of these as the three big DON\u2019Ts of marriage:Blaming: Spouses have been casting blame on one another since Adam blamed Eve and Eve blamed the serpent. When you blame your spouse, what you\u2019re really doing is trying to dodge responsibility for your own unhappiness by placing it on him or her. And when your spouse (predictably) reacts angrily to your accusation, that sparks a cycle of anger, blame, and more anger.Feeling Sorry for Yourself: When you wallow in self-pity, it can eventually consume your life. Complaining becomes your primary form of communication with one another, and eventually with your friends and family. Spouses who feel sorry for themselves make their spouses miserable, and self-pitying couples make their friends and families miserable. Your marriage can\u2019t be happy if you\u2019re stuck in self-pity.Resenting Your Spouse: It\u2019s normal to feel pain, anger, and disappointment when you\u2019re treated unfairly, especially by your spouse. But brooding and holding onto those negative emotions will eventually create resentment. And when you allow resentment to thrive, it grows under the surface of your marriage like cancer.If any of these issues has already become rooted firmly in your life, you may need to seek professional counseling in order to change your patterns. It will take some time, healing, and hard work to change track, but it will be worth it. Keep your marriage free of blame, self-pity, and resentment, and you\u2019re well on your way to lifelong happiness.",  "id": "26"}

And while her directional chapeau has become quite the conversation piece on Twitter, likened to Beyonc\u00e9 in her \"Formation\" music video and Jude Law's turn as the Young Pope among other cultural touchstones, it's her polished, color-coordinated French manicure, perhaps worn in honor of the French family's first visit, that's been thrust into the spotlight on the heels of that awkward hand-holding moment.In a new video making the rounds on the Internet, Melania's immaculate, oval-shaped talons\u2014accented by a sheer, pink tinged base and delicate white tips\u2014are front row and center as her husband reaches to grasp her hand, is painfully rebuffed, and then tries once more, before she eventually gives in.

FLOTUS\u2019s refusal to give in to the typical lovey dovey political gesture is apparent not only in her stiff posture, but also in her protective wardrobe choices.Take today\u2019s wide brim hat, for instance. Mrs. Trump wore it dipped down low to cover the top of her brow, just enough to shield herself, perhaps, from the gaze of the President. At the inauguration last year, the First Lady teleported herself back in time to the late 1950s by wearing a Tiffany blue high-neck jacket and dress with matching opera gloves; no hand holding attempts can be made gracefully with those suckers on.

Of course there will be a little bit of surfing, but the goal, he tells us, is to give people an inside look at what transpires in the daily life of a traveling surfer.

It'll be everything from the traveling to chasing swells to talking shit with friends. Even the partying or whatever happens on the trip. We'll be showing how stressful traveling actually gets--like not scoring, not having the right board or someone not making their flight. Just stuff that happens everyday for us that I think is actually entertaining. I think we're going to premiere a little short 10 to 15-minute film at the end of the year. We'll see how it goes--nothing is set in stone.\nWhat percentage of the year would you say you're on the road?I travel about 6 to 7 months out of the year just chasing swells and coming home when I can. This summer I really want to score Japan, Fiji, Indo, Namibia and Tahiti whenever it gets good.\nSo in the opening scene of this first episode, it looks like you've got a good amount of boards in the background--what does your normal traveling quiver look like?If I was going to Indo I would probably bring nothing by shortboards, but if we're going to Tahiti for a solid paddle swell I'd bring a couple 6'6\"s, a 6'3\" and a shortboard. If we were going to a big wave we'll bring our 10\u20190\u2033s.\nNo foils?Maybe a foil. It's really fun once you get the hang of it. I\u2019m actually going out with John [Florence] right now to foil. It's as windy as North Shore gets so we\u2019re going like 2 miles out to sea and are going to tow into wind chops.\nYou ride for Pyzel. How's your relationship with him?He's my neighbor so I see him pretty much every day.\nI imagine it\u2019s nice having a good relationship with your shaper when going on strike missions and needing to trust what's under your feet without having to deliberate too long over what boards to bring.I'm so comfortable on his boards-especially his bigger ones in Tahiti and at Pipe-I can just feel them and know that they'll be good. If I pick up a different board that I'm not comfortable with, I don't have that same confidence that I would have if I had my go-to 6'6\". Good boards are really important.\nIt also looks like you scored a fun Pipe session-when was that?It was the other day! It was really random because it\u2019s super late for Pipe to be working like that. I just surfed pipe today actually. I got a little barrel. It's making it really hard to leave home at this point [laughs].\n ",  "id": "36"}

{"content": "For teenagers in the European Union, WhatsApp is about to change in a big way. \nThe Facebook-owned messaging app is raising its age limit from 13 to 16 in Europe to meet the new European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) law, which comes in to force on May 25.\n\nAccording to the app's new Terms of Service, WhatsApp will ask users to confirm they are 16 or over when asked to agree to new terms of service and a privacy policy, which will be sent out in \"the next few weeks.\" \nIf you live in a country in the European Region, you must be at least 16 years old to use our Services or such greater age required in your country to register for or use our Services. If you live in any other country except those in the European Region, you must be at least 13 years old to use our Services or such greater age required in your country to register for or use our Services. In addition to being of the minimum required age to use our Services under applicable law, if you are not old enough to have authority to agree to our Terms in your country, your parent or guardian must agree to our Terms on your behalf.\nIt's not currently known how WhatsApp will enforce or even verify its new age limit. Mashable reached out to WhatsApp for clarification but didn't hear back immediately. \nTeenagers elsewhere in the world needn't fret: the app is said to be keeping its age limit at 13 outside the EU. \nIn one month, the EU will introduce strict personal data protections, which will restrict how tech companies collect and use your data. These new rules will also ensure that tech companies inform users exactly what they're getting up to. \nFacebook won't be mirroring WhatsApp's new minimum age policy, though. It plans to ask under-16s to nominate a parent or guardian who can grant permission for them to share information on the app. If they don't follow this step, they won't have access to a \"fully personalised\" version of Facebook. \n",  "id": "39"}

While the weather will also be drier than normal there, Texas and the rest of the central part of the South will experience heavy thunderstorms. From the Rockies to the Midwest there will be normal amounts of precipitation, however, over in the Northeast and New England the hot summer weather will also be much drier than normal, which could lead to drought conditions, the Farmers\u2019 Almanac predicts.  \u201cWe base our predictions on a specific and reliable set of rules that were developed back in 1818 by David Young, the Farmers\u2019 Almanac\u2019s first editor,\u201d Peter Geiger, the Farmers\u2019 Almanac\u2019s current editor, said in a statement. \u201cThe formula has been altered slightly over the years and now includes both mathematical and astronomical factors.\u201d   While the daily weather can always change at the last-minute, the Farmers\u2019 Almanac says that their long-range predictions have been accurate between 80 and 85 percent of the time.

He wanted to capture that and show his version of it. \n\u201cNow, is it the be all, end all version? Absolutely not,\u201d Allen said. \u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of it, and as I do these interviews, I\u2019m starting to learn more about my book through others\u2019 interpretations of what they\u2019re seeing.

{"content": "Carousel is by no means a new play, but thanks to a new production currently on Broadway, the 73-year-old Rodgers and Hammerstein musical feels much fresher than one might expect. This sparkle can be credited to any number of thoughtful aspects of the new production, including dazzling choreography from New York City Ballet whiz kid Justin Peck, deft direction by Jack O\u2019Brien, striking costumes by Ann Roth\u2014and a powerful cast including Tony winner Jessie Mueller, opera legend Ren\u00e9e Fleming, and two-time Tony nominee Joshua Henry as the carnival worker Billy Bigelow.\n\n\n\nHenry, who previously appeared on Broadway in Shuffle Along, Violet, and The Scottsboro Boys, gives what the New York Times calls a \u201cthoughtful and powerful\u201d performance and manages to make Billy\u2014a character Henry himself charitably calls \u201ccomplicated\u201d\u2014something more than just a villain. Here, Henry talks to T&amp;C about taking on a show almost a century old, and why his next gig needs to be funny.   Carousel first premiered in 1945, so this is definitely a revival, but thanks to the dance element it feels new in a way to the audience. Does that resonate with you on-stage as well?  I think it does. The movement in the show is something I hadn\u2019t seen\u2014not like this, to bring such incredible movement to Broadway. I got involved with the show when I was doing Shuffle Along on Broadway time in 2016, and [the producer] Scott Rudin called me into his office and mentioned this idea that he had, he said he thought I\u2019d make a great Billy Bigelow. There are times when a producer just says, \u201cI think you can do this,\u201d and it\u2019s one of those iconic roles, so I of course said \u201cyes.\u201d  Jessie Mueller and Joshua Henry in Carousel.\n\n\n\nJulieta Cervantes\n\nThere are so many classic shows that maybe wouldn\u2019t feel right in this moment now. What about Carousel makes it a good revival for today?  I think the focus of this piece is redemption, it asks the question of whether, after we do something that we really aren\u2019t proud of, we get second chance. I also hope the audience walks away with the idea that one has to take responsibility for themselves. It\u2019s about knowing that your past is yours to step into, that you can break any cycle that comes before you, and that you can forge ahead in a better direction. Those things are very important. Billy isn\u2019t the most likeable guy. What did you find in him to make it possible for you to spend this much time in his head?   I really liked the idea of playing\u2014I won\u2019t say the underdog\u2014but characters who have a lot of conflict. I don\u2019t like playing superheroes, but characters that are really complicated like Billy do attract me. Yes, he does some things that are just wrong, and that person is really hard to connect with, but where I did connect with him was in the eventual passion that he has to do something incredible for his child and for his family. That\u2019s kind of where I am right now, having just had a child a month agom, so that\u2019s my own connection right now. A lot of people have had previous experiences with Carousel. What has this production taught you about the show that you didn\u2019t know before?  \n\n\n\n\nPrior to being in Carousel, I had only seen the movie. So, when I read the script I felt like it was a lot deeper than the movie portrayed it to be. To be honest, what I think is brought out in the stage production, especially in ours, is the spirituality of what Rodgers and Hammerstein put into this piece, which was something that I sort of feel like was previously glossed over.   Joshua Henry\n\n\n\nJason Goodrich\n\nThis show is choreographed by Justin Peck and has some very serious movement. It\u2019s absolutely gorgeous to watch, but how has it been to perform like that in addition to your acting duties?  It definitely is a lot of movement; it\u2019s very physical. I love being in the gym, and am training six days a week; I do a lot of high-intensity interval training so that my heart rate gets really high and I practice, as I\u2019m doing that, taking really deep breaths and that really helps in a song and in a style of music where you have to sing long, flowing, lines. \nFor your next show, maybe you\u2019ll look for something nice and quiet.   Maybe one where I sit in a chair for 90 minutes. Or an hour-and-a-half comedy. Is a 90-minute, no-intermission show as appealing to a performer as it is to an audience member?   Oh, yes. Of course, sometimes you need your character to go on a journey\u2014but if you can get a journey done in 90 minutes, it\u2019s like, that felt good! \n\n\n\n\n\n",  "id": "67"}

After kindergarten, assessment should be made as early as possible in primary school.\n\n\nHe said there was a shortage of school psychologists, who were in charge of making assessments in primary and secondary schools, and one psychologist needed to take care of seven schools, which might have slowed down the assessments.\nSin said the government needed to raise this ratio to one psychologist for four schools.\n\u201cAlthough any child could be identified with learning issues at any stage, the guiding principle should be that there are enough resources to make sure the assessment service is sufficient,\u201d Sin said.\nThe audit report found that some schools had not received the required number of visits by psychologists.\nLast academic year, 330 out of 844 publicly funded mainstream primary and secondary schools received regular educational psychology service provided by the bureau. Among these schools, 27 received fewer than the required 18 visits a year, with one school receiving only 10.\nAnother 484 schools received such service provided by school sponsoring bodies, and 11 of these schools received fewer than the required 14 visits, with one school receiving only four.\nThe remaining 30 schools received enhanced service, which raises the required number of visits to 30. However, four of them received fewer than the 30 visits.\nAbout 42,890 pupils with special education needs studied in those 844 schools last school year.\nThe bureau told the lawmakers earlier this month that it had been \u201cprogressively improving\u201d the ratio to one educational psychologist to four priority schools, meaning those with a large number or proportion of pupils with special education needs. It added that some 120 schools will receive this enhanced provision next year.\nThe bureau said major reasons for insufficient visits were sick leave and maternity or paternity leaves. It added that it would step up efforts to monitor school visits.\n  ",  "id": "68"}

Combining images taken about six months apart (meaning they were shot from opposite sides of our planet's orbit) can give the distances to these stars in much the same way that having two eyes gives you depth perception.Now we have a database of the distances to around 1.3 billion stars located across a full quarter of our galaxy. That database was just made publicly accessible, so scientists from around the world can use it to make discoveries.\"Gaia is astronomy at its finest,\" says Fred Jansen, Gaia mission manager at ESA. \"Scientists will be busy with this data for many years, and we are ready to be surprised by the avalanche of discoveries that will unlock the secrets of our Galaxy.\"Although this database is already quite impressive on its own, Gaia actually gives much more information than that. In addition to distance, Gaia can track the movement of all of those stars, so we know where they\u2019re headed and where they came from. The database also contains the color and brightness of almost every single star, which can tell astronomers a great deal of information about every one.\u201cThe new Gaia data are so powerful that exciting results are just jumping at us,\u201d says Antonella Vallenari from the Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica (INAF) and the Astronomical Observatory of Padua. \u201cIt feels like we are inaugurating a new era of Galactic archaeology.\"If you're interested in checking out Gaia's map for yourself, there are several different ways to explore the dataset at the ESA's website here.Source: ESA\n\n\n\n\n\n",  "id": "69"}

{"content": "Japanese companies are facing a workforce automation problem. It\u2019s not the kind you normally hear about, though \u2014 workers aren\u2019t afraid they\u2019ll lose their jobs to machines. Instead, the companies need to engineer robots to replace the droves of Japanese workers approaching retirement age.\nRight now, over a quarter of the Japanese population is over the age of 65, and that number is expected to jump to 40 percent over the next 40 years. That\u2019s bad news for industries that will need to replace those retiring workers, especially for industries like construction for which automation hasn\u2019t caught on as quickly.\nSome companies are working to develop new robots to aid in high-rise construction. Many have been developed, but few deployed. One, Shimizu, is about to test its newly-developed robotic welder, carrier, and all-purpose lifting tool.\nIt\u2019s not been easy to get this far, and the robots are still nowhere near perfect, according to an article in Bloomberg Technology. The problem is that working on a building requires people or robots to actually, you know, move around within the building. In spite of improvements in autonomous machinery, engineers haven\u2019t quite figured out how to make a robot that can do meaningful construction work while being able to move as they need to on a construction site.\nBut Japan\u2019s construction industry needs these bots, like, now. When an industry is automated, workers are often displaced. But now, those employees are leaving either way, and the tech needed to fill in the gaps might not be ready.\nExperts suspect robots can take over some of the welding, shipping, and basic tasks involved in constructing a new high rise. But even then, robot labor will only make up about 1 percent of each project, based on current technology.\nConstruction bots, which include assembly robots (the kind that work in factories) as well as autonomous, self-navigating vehicles like forklifts, will mainly work night and weekend shifts. Because the technology is so new, current workers would feel more comfortable not working in the same space, for safety purposes. This is required of autonomous vehicles on construction sites but will also be the case for assembly bots used in construction.\nThe robot revolution is still off in the distance, but for the sake of Japan\u2019s future constructions, maybe we should hope it comes around a bit sooner.\n",  "id": "75"}

According to Deadline, the show will be revived for 40 new episodes. The revival series will feature new challenges as well as old favorites like the human hamster wheel and the giant Double Dare nose. The game features two teams competing against each other to win special prizes. On the original show, the teams would compete in a series of physical and trivia challenges, and had the opportunity to dare each other in order to win double and quadruple the amount of money. At the end of the game, both teams won the amount of money they raised but the one on top got to compete in the special Double Dare obstacle course. \n\n\n\nAccording to Nickelodeon's press release, the original series ran from 1986 to 1993 and was revamped several times for shows like Super Sloppy Double Dare and Family Double Dare. The show was revived in 2000 as the aptly named Double Dare 2000.The new competition will include \"blasts from the past and stars from today,\" according to the network. In 2016, Nickelodeon brought back Double Dare for a 30th anniversary  reunion special, featuring the cast members of All That and Double Dare host Marc Summers.

The filters Thomas referenced are the comment filters Instagram has rolled out over the past couple years, which let users block specific words and phrases in comments and even toggle post comments completely on or off. (It's how Kim Kardashian blocked the snake emoji from her Instagram comments when Swifties were using it to troll her in 2017).) All three teens said they use the features to keep their time on Insta fun and productive, so they don't dwell on negative comments.On a separate panel, Ana Homayoun, author of Social Media Wellness: Helping Tweens and Teens Thrive in an Unbalanced Digital World, told moderator Kate Lewis, Hearst Digital's editorial director, that the key to helping teens have healthy experiences on social media is to educate yourself about the safety features, like comment filters, and show your kids how to use them. \"Make sure they know they can opt in and out of things,\" Homayoun said. \"Make it about them, and how they can curate their social media to be positive.\"\nAija Mayrock agreed that she wishes adults would've showed her those kind of features and explained the effects of having a public versus private account, rather than just enforcing bans on social media. \"Instagram helped me survive bullying, it's been a place of connecting for me,\" she said. \"You just need to know how to curate it to fit the things you care about, and block negativity.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n",  "id": "78"}

{"content": "What is the point in living if you cannot do something that you love and enjoy? Leading a fulfilling life is important for many of us, with many young people refusing to settle for dead-end jobs without a future. Wanting to do something that we love, both inside and outside our careers, is only human, and with life being so short, can we really afford to not chase our dreams?You\u2019ll Feel More Fulfilled\nAs previously mentioned, doing something you love will fill you with fulfillment \u2013 a crucial ingredient to leading a happy life. Many of us drift from place to place, looking for a sense of accomplishment and completion, and if you feel content, you\u2019re more likely to be both physically and mentally well. \nYour career should make you feel good emotionally, and it shouldn\u2019t leave you disheartened, stressed and depressed. Instead, you should want to head to your day job, excited for what it entails. Leading a more satisfied life will transcend into other aspects of your being, and you will, in turn, radiate success wherever you go.\nYou\u2019ll Be Inspired\nWhen we are inspired, we have a purpose, but for this to happen, we have to be engaged with the environment around us. Our job, friends, and family should all inspire us to be better, and they should also coax us into either new professions, lifestyles or life experiences. \nIf you\u2019re a creative type, then the inspiration for you to create, whether it\u2019s through painting, writing or even flower arranging, is crucial to your livelihood. Make this something you love your profession, or if it\u2019s a hobby, ensure you have the inspiration to engage with your hobbies outside of work hours and in your free time. Although inspiration comes and goes, the more you love something, more frequent it will be. Find your creative stimuli, whether it\u2019s through vaping, running or gardening. Improve your chances of becoming inspired by investing in your hobbies: do you need a new easel? Head to the best arts and crafts store. Is your vaping equipment old and rusty? Head to Redjuice for the latest vaping mods. Tired of your job? Send out your CV.\nYou\u2019ll Be More Dynamic \nTo succeed in life, you need to be proactive in your approach. When you\u2019re stuck in a nine-to-five job, you don\u2019t enjoy, but you need to pay the bills, your mood will lower, your health depletes, and you\u2019ll become more prone to mental health issues. Humans are not meant to be stagnant; humans are meant to be dynamic. Rather than settle for a job, look for a career that\u2019ll propel you forwards. The same notion applies to all areas of your life: aren\u2019t happy in your relationship? It\u2019s time to move on. No longer happy with your hometown? Find a new place to put down roots. Tired of playing football? Trade it in for a newer, more exciting sport.\nYou\u2019ll Prosper\nThe \u201cAnswer to the Ultimate Questions of Life, the Universe, and Everything\u201d isn\u2019t the number 42. Instead, it\u2019s the business of doing whatever it is you love. Life is short, so be sure to live it to the max. By doing so, you\u2019ll be able to see the world for all it is, and you\u2019ll be a more successful and inspired person because of it. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n",  "id": "82"}

{"content": "Nobody ever said that designing a home is easy. That\u2019s why construction projects require an entire team of skilled people, from architects to contractors and everything in-between! You\u2019d think that with all of that professional input, new homes would come out perfectly\u2014but that just ain\u2019t the case!\nIn fact, homes and buildings often feature all sorts of giant mistakes! Take the following home design fails, for example. Each one is as nigh-unforgivable as it is hilarious. It\u2019s hard to believe that anybody let these pass inspection, but we\u2019re sort of glad they did\u2026\n\n1. Hey, do you know where would be a great place to install a toilet? Oh, how about the kitchen? You know, the same room where you prepare and eat the very food that you put in your mouth!\n3. How does a project like this even get to this point? Surely, even a novice would realize, \u201cThis has to close somehow.\u201d Evidently, even just installing a door handle isn\u2019t always a simple task.\n\n4. You probably could park your car in this driveway, so long as you have an almost superhuman ability to line up your tires. Still, one has to wonder who ever thought this design was a good idea?\n5. Why is the refrigerator simply sitting on its own in the middle of that kitchen? In the history of refrigerators, has anybody ever designed their kitchen on its own little island like this?\n6. Whoever built this cabinet made a grave mistake: they installed it just over the light switch! They even had to cut part of the switch off to accommodate it. Clearly, planning isn\u2019t overrated.\n8. When you\u2019re preparing your home office, make sure that you have everything that you\u2019ll need to have a productive day. That means a computer, a comfortable chair, and\u2026 a toilet? Sure, why not.\n10. What purpose do these big, obstructive columns serve exactly? Are they supposed to be holding the house together? If that\u2019s the case, why was this place built on such a flimsy foundation in the first place?\n15. What on Earth is even happening here? This bathroom is designed in such an insane fashion that one could only wonder if it was done intentionally. Assuming that\u2019s the case, can someone please stop this monster?\n\n\n16. Whoever designed the railing for this seemingly normal staircase is either incredibly lazy or is trying too hard to apply surrealist sensibilities to home design. They would make the Dadaists proud.\n18. To be fair, there couldn\u2019t have been an easy way to build a driveway up to a house at such a steep elevation. Surely there must have been a better way to park the homeowners\u2019 cars than this!\n21. Why is this door knob in the center of the door itself? How would that even work? It\u2019s sort of like the door to a hobbit hole, except it\u2019s not in the Shire and is about 10,000 percent less magical.\n23. Here\u2019s an example of an instance in which nobody thought about the important relationship between one piece of furniture with another. Come on, get your act together, contractors!\n\n24. Hey, do you know what every home needs for their garage? Stairs! No, not the stairs from the inside of the house to the garage itself, but for some sort of sci-fi vehicle with legs.\n28. Clearly, the best place to keep an outlet is right where rainwater is inevitably going to come gushing down right on top of it. That\u2019s certainly not a surefire way to set the entire house on fire, no sir.\n30. The good news with a garage like this is that you know that nobody\u2019s going to be able to steal your car from it. The bad news is that you\u2019ll have no way of parking your car in there in the first place!\n\nHopefully, these homeowners were able to get some much-needed repairs.

{"content": "If a monkey takes a selfie, who owns the photo?\nThat question has been buzzing around for literally years now, ever since 2015, when People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) sued a photographer for the rights to a \u201cmonkey selfie\u201d that went viral in 2011. At long last, we have an answer: this week, a U.S. court decided that, no, monkeys can\u2019t own copyright because U.S. copyright law only applies to humans.\nThat ruling has implications beyond how nice a house that photogenic macaque can afford. It could set a precedent for what kind of entities legally qualify as \u201ccreators,\u201d especially as artificial intelligence evolves to create more.\nA quick recap of the details: David Slater is the photographer at the center of this controversy, and the face that launched a million lawsuits (OK, maybe just one) belongs to an Indonesia crested macaque called Naruto.\nIn September 2015, PETA filed Naruto vs. Slater, claiming it was representing the monkey under \u201cnext friend\u201d status. In the lawsuit, the organization asked for control of all proceeds related to the monkey selfie, noting that it would spend the money to benefit Naruto and other macaques.\nIn September 2017, things seemed to finally come to an amicable end: Slater and PETA settled the lawsuit out of court. Slater could own the copyright, on the condition that he would donate 25 percent of proceeds from the monkey selfie to Indonesian organizations that protected crested macaques.\nBoth parties requested that the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals dismiss the case, but it refused. This week, it issued its pretty scathing 41-page ruling on the case. The short version: Naruto\u2019s not a human, so the law doesn\u2019t apply to him. P.S. PETA\u2019s the worst.\nWhile PETA might think twice before bringing another suit like this again (the court ruled it must pay all of Slater\u2019s legal fees), it may not be the last time U.S. courts have to rule on the copyright ownership of works created by non-humans.\nAI can already create paintings, write fiction, and compose music. They are, arguably, creators in their own right. Currently, the copyrights to these works belong to the engineers that created those AI. But that very well might change if AI continues to evolve.\n\u201cIn my view, a self-aware, autonomous AI would be the prerequisite for its works to be protectable by copyright,\u201d copyright expert Dave Davis wrote in TechCrunch.\nAccording to various AI experts, we may meet that prerequisite within the next two or three decades. Some nations are already diving into the murky territory of giving AI legal rights that land somewhere between those of humans and animals.\nCopyright laws could join the list of those in need of an AI-era revamp, and in the not-so-distant future, courts may face a somewhat altered version of the question asked by Naruto vs. Slater:\nIf an AI takes a selfie, who owns the photo?\n\n\n",  "id": "92"}

This means you can launch and start playing the games almost immediately without even unlocking your iPhone. Since these games live as widgets, they're all pretty simple puzzle and arcade-style ones, games you won't feel bad about closing when you're back to real-life duties like paying for food. One game's origins even dates back to the '60s when you could only play it on mainframe computers, but that doesn't make it any less addicting. Another app listed below has a total of three games you can play.\n\nAdding These Games to Your Today ViewIf you're unfamiliar with adding widgets to your Today View, it's fairly simple. Some of these games will let you 3D Touch on their icon on the home screen to select \"Add Widget,\" while the others will make you select \"Edit\" at the bottom of the Today View screen to add them to approved widgets list. For more information, check out our full guide on adding widgets linked below. App 1: Quickgets SnakeSnake is the perfect pick-up-and-play game, where you are a two-dimensional snake trying to eat and get larger. If you eat yourself or hit a wall, you lose. You're given a virtual D-pad to control your little buddy, so it's no Nokia experience, but it's still a great game to play at the drop of a hat. You can even tweak some settings like grid size and colors. However, \"Quickgets Snake\" is not free and will run you $0.99.Install Quickgets Snake for $0.99 from the iOS App Store App 2: Minesweeper - Widget EditionAnother oldie but goodie. First introduced in the '60s, Minesweeper has been ported over to nearly platform, rising to prominence when Microsoft added it as one of its main games in Windows starting in 1992 and lasting all the way until Windows 8 came out (though you can still download it from the Microsoft Store).The game involves you locating mines on a grid by tapping. You're given hints as to where they're located, so make sure to mark the mines once you find them with a tap-and-hold. You win by tapping every non-mine space in the grid, and you can double-tap any space to reveal all un-flagged squares at once. This variation gives you a bunch of options such as difficulties levels and custom grids.Install Minesweeper - Widget Edition for $0.99 from the iOS App Store App 3: Steve - The Jumping Dinosaur!This is a port of the infinite runner game that you can play in Google Chrome. While not officially sanctioned by Google, Steve gets major points for both being able to play inside a widget and while still online (you can only play the Chrome game while offline). Simply tap anywhere on the widget to jump Steve across all the cacti in the desert, and see how far you get.Install Steve - The Jumping Dinosaur! for free from the iOS App Store App 4: Gameboard - Widget GameIt's Flappy Bird! Even though the game's best days were in 2014, clones still pop up all the time since its creator pulled it from the App Store). This widget is no different. It's effectively the same addictive and frustrating game, where you squeeze through pipes by tapping the screen to have the bird flap its wings.You can also switch the widget game to Piggie Jump via the \"Gameboard - Widget Game for Swaggie bird, and Piggie jump\" application, which has you jumping a little piggy up a series of rungs without missing one.

Navigate obstacles by jumping over spikes and try to stay alive. While similar in concept to Steve, I find this game a little more challenging, albeit a little less charming aesthetically. There's also a pro version available for $0.99 that gives you double-jump abilities.Install Bale Ball Widget for free from the iOS App Store App 6: Overglide - Widget GameProbably the most graphically polished game of the bunch, Overglide puts you in the shoes of a paper airplane trying to glide around obstacles. By tapping and holding, the airplane glides upwards, and by not tapping, it naturally falls towards the ground. Overglide will also run you $0.99 to play.",  "id": "93"}

Save it to your desktop, read it on your tablet, or email to your colleagues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMillions upon millions of US citizens receive the cash they\u2019ve worked hard for each pay day and spend it however they prefer. However, when we take a look at the big picture there are a few major categories that are constantly consuming most of your cash. Perhaps unsurprisingly, we found that taxes take up most of the expense, with over $13 out of the total $100 lifetime earnings being paid back to the government. You can\u2019t help but feel doleful when you imagine the savings you could have garnered if these major consumers were dropped out of the picture.\nLottoland acquired data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 most recent consumer expenditure report in an attempt to estimate how the average US citizen\u2019s earnings were dolled out between these major expenditure categories. To do this, several factors had to be taken into account:\nEach expenditure category was firstly multiplied by 78.74 years, the national average life expectancy for people living in the US. We then calculated the size of each category relative to 100 in order to gain a better sense of each categories\u2019 contribution to the overall picture.\nAs tax was excluded from the report, we ensured this and also student loan repayments were taken into account \u2013 each were calculated using national average tax payment amounts &amp; student loan debts, verified by reputable sites. CNBC, for example, recently published an article utilising data taken from COMET Financial Intelligence, whom released a report indicating that the average student loan borrower owes $37,172 by the time they leave education. Using a typical 10-year repayment plan and a fixed interest rate of 6.8% (the norm for graduates/professionals), means that by the time the loan is fully paid off, each student borrower will have paid around $51,333.19.\nStudent loans are typically seen by recent graduates to be a major expense \u2013 interestingly, in the grand scheme of things a student loan\u2019s repayment is fairly minimal when compared to some of the other main expenditure categories. In fact, it placed bottom of our list.\nAccording to the IRS\u2019s most recent preliminary data release concerning individual income tax returns, total income tax reached nearly $1.5 trillion in tax year 2015. When divided by the total number of taxpayers (150.6 trillion), the average amount of tax assessed per taxpayer was estimated at around $9,655 (as reported by The Motley Fool). Although our source data works off averages, they still provide a rough idea of how the average US citizen distributes their money.\nWhen looking at the big picture, it appears that taxes top the list, closely followed by transportation, personal insurance &amp; pensions and owned dwellings, amounting in total to a 37.9% drain on your overall life\u2019s earnings.

{"content": "\u201cTake advantage of every opportunity to practice your communication skills so that when important occasions arise, you will have the gift, the style, the sharpness, the clarity, and the emotions to affect other people.\u201d \u2013 Jim RohnCommunication is key to navigating life\u2019s many challenges. From romantic relationships to friendships to work situations, everyone should know how to communicate effectively. Not everyone is the best at communicating. This is because communication is a skill that needs to be developed and practiced.     If you find you\u2019re a little lacking in the communication department, have no fear. Developing a few simple habits can help you become a better communicator. Here are some of the best ways to learn and foster your communication skills.Here Are 5 Habits That Give You Better Communication Skills 1. Start asking questionsCommunication is about listening just as much as it is about talking. When someone is speaking, you want to take note of what they\u2019re saying. No, you don\u2019t need a clipboard or a notebook and pen. A good way to do this is to ask questions about what the other person is saying. Of course, you don\u2019t want to bombard them with questions about every detail of what they\u2019re saying. At the same time, when you identify parts of the conversation you want to know more about and ask follow up questions, you are on the way to better communication.2. Say what you mean and mean what you sayMargarita Tartakovsky, M.S, says that having a more precise vocabulary will help you improve your communication skills. You want to make sure you\u2019re not leaving room for misinterpretation when you speak. Two good rules to stand by are: don\u2019t say things that you think other people want to hear, and don\u2019t say things that you don\u2019t want to stand behind. Part of having good communication skills is saying what you mean and meaning what you say. You will be able to communicate your ideas much more clearly when you use precise language and don\u2019t waffle on what you mean.     3. Use your body languageBody language is an amazing tool when it comes to communication. Thankfully, our bodies are usually pretty good at communicating on their own. Still, if you want to have better communication skills, you should have an idea of what types of body language will help you express yourself clearly. For example, try to avoid crossing your arms when talking. This can make you seem very closed off, and not open to new ideas. Another way to use body language is to subtly copy the person with whom you\u2019re speaking. It helps put the other person at ease and develop a rapport.4. ListenYou really want to actively listen when other people talk. Listening is key when it comes to becoming a better communicator. Don\u2019t just wait for your turn to talk. A lot of people confuse \u201clistening\u201d with \u201chearing.\u201d Sure, you hear what another person is saying, but are you taking in what\u2019s being said? What is the emotional state of the person talking? Can you tell the things they\u2019re not saying, despite what they are saying? It\u2019s important to learn how to listen if you want to improve your communication skills. After all, you need to be able to respond accurately in order to communicate in the first place.5. Acknowledge first; speak secondWhen it comes to communicating, a good communicator always knows to acknowledge what has just been said before taking the opportunity to speak. For example, you can simply say, \u201cYes, I hear what you\u2019re saying\u2026\u201d And then go on to speak. Better yet, acknowledge specific parts of what the other person has said to show that you\u2019ve been utilizing your listening skills. \u201cI understand that\u2026\u201d or, \u201cSo, what you\u2019re saying is\u2026\u201d are good phrases to practice when it comes to this part of communicating.Not only will the other person feel heard, but they will more likely to listen to what you have to say as well. When communicating, it\u2019s important to make the other person want to listen to you as much as they want to speak.Final thoughtsThese are some of the best habits to practice when you\u2019re trying to become better at communication. They\u2019re all things that are practical in every conversation, especially debate or arguments. Finally, one of the most important habits is practice. You always want to practice your communication skills. Luckily, you can do this daily, with people that you talk to throughout your day! No need to wait for a special moment to freshen up your good communication habits.     References: https://psychcentral.com/blog/6-strategies-to-become-a-better-communicator/     ",  "id": "104"}

The coaching search continues, but this will take time.Yet another day has passed with little movement on the coaching search for the New York Knicks. The search for the new head coach continues and there is no indication that anyone on the current list has been taken off the list.Here is the current list of candidates:I\u2019m sure for some fans, this coaching search feels like it is dragging on\u2014but it\u2019s really not. Although it feels like it happened forever ago, Jeff Hornacek was let go less than two weeks ago.The best thing Steve Mills and Scott Perry can do is take their time. It\u2019s a phrase that gets overused way too much this time of year, but the team is doing their \u201cdue diligence\u201d in their coaching search.They likely won\u2019t make any big decisions for at least another week or two. They will have to wait and see if any quality coaches get fired for not being able to win a playoff series. That\u2019s unlikely\u2014but that patience is necessary when you\u2019re doing your due diligence.And even putting the waiting game aside, the process of hiring a head coach can be a grueling process for a front office. Mike Vorkunov of The Athletic wrote a very insightful piece detailing some of the ins and outs of a head coaching search from inside the front office.Any time an organization is hiring a new head coach, they hope they are finding a Gregg Popovich or a Steve Kerr, that can guide the franchise to multiple championships.

{"content": "The New York Giants are looking to part ways with former first-round pick Ereck Flowers, according to reports.Ereck Flowers\u2019 days with the New York Giants might be numbered.ESPN\u2019s Jordan Raanan reports that the Giants may try to trade Flowers for a draft pick in this year\u2019s NFL Draft which begins on Thursday.Flowers has had his fair share of struggles at the left tackle position ever since the Giants selected him with the ninth overall pick in the 2015 NFL Draft.Pass protection has been Flowers\u2019 biggest issue on the field, as he\u2019s failed to provide quarterback Eli Manning much protection on his blindside.     Manning was sacked 31 times in 2017, many which were the result of Flowers and former teammate Bobby Hart\u2018s struggles at both tackle positions.Flowers\u2019 work ethic came into question last season. Reports of his lack of effort and bad attitude in the locker room came into question during the last week of the season when Flowers, who was dealing with a groin injury, didn\u2019t even try to give it a go in practice that week.Flowers did not play in the Giants\u2019 season finale against the Washington Redskins.Flowers will be making the switch from left to right tackle this season. Nate Solder, who signed a mega four-year, $62 million deal as a free agent, will be the team\u2019s new starter at left tackle.It seems from the ways things ended last season and the signing of Solder has made Flowers unhappy.He\u2019s has not participated in the team\u2019s offseason workout program this spring, which Raanan reports \u201cdoesn\u2019t appear to be received well\u201d by the Giants coaching staff.Flowers is scheduled to make $2.4 million in 2018. He can become an unrestricted free agent after this season if the Giants decide not to pick up the fifth-year option on his rookie contract.Though he has struggled at left tackle during his NFL career, Flowers does possess the size and skill to be a solid run blocker on the right side of an offensive line in the NFL. His character issues, though, may make him very tough to trade for the Giants, said an NFL executive.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t mess with him,\u201d one personnel executive with an NFC team told Raanan. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want him in the building.

Henderson/Getty Images)Competing with Flowers for the Giants\u2019 starting right tackle job are Chad Wheeler and Adam Bisnowaty.Both have some NFL experience, with Wheeler having the most, starting in five games for the Giants last season and he showed some promise during his rookie season.The Giants don\u2019t need to trade Flowers, but if they feel he\u2019s not a guy they want in their locker room, Wheeler may be a nice option instead at right tackle.

New York Yankees 8 (13-9)Minnesota Twins 3 (8-10)W: C.C. Sabathia (1-0, 1.86 ERA) L: Jose Berrios (2-2, 2.84 ERA)AL, Final, Box ScoreYankee Stadium, Bronx, New YorkFor the second straight night, the New York Yankees pummeled the Minnesota Twins 8-3, thanks to four more long balls hit by the Bomber bats this evening.C.C. Sabathia was up to his old tricks, as the veteran lefty completely silenced the Twins\u2019 bats in rout to his 20th victory against this Minnesota team in his career. Gary Sanchez led the way with another multi-home run night as he and the Baby Bombers brought their current winning streak up to four games.Early DeficitAfter CC Sabathia retired Brian Dozier on just one pitch to begin the night, the Minnesota Twins put together a scoring rally that gave them an early lead on the big lefty.Sabathia issued a two-out walk to Miguel Sano, who came around to score when the next batter Eduardo Escobar drilled a double into right field that saw Aaron Judge bobble the ball to allow Sano to come all the way around from first to make it 1-0 Minnesota.Again, after needing just one pitch to get through the first batter, Sabathia ended up needing to hurl 22 pitches to get out of the first frame.History MadeWhen CC Sabathia struck out Gary Sanchez\u2019s best friend Logan Morrison in the top of the second, the big lefty tied Jim Bunning for 17th place on the all-time strikeout list at 2,855 career punch outs. Congrats, big guy.Gary Sanchez Puts the GS in GPSAfter Sabathia worked a 1-2-3 second inning, Gary Sanchez took a Berrios fastball and deposited it into the right-field seats for a game-tying solo shot. It\u2019s worth noting that Berrios struck out three consecutive batters before serving up the Sanchez equalizer. What a way to buck that trend.Back In FrontWith the Yankees tying the game up in the second; they set their sites on jumping back in front in the bottom of the third, and that\u2019s exactly what they did.Brett Gardner got things started with a one-out walk, advancing to third on an Aaron Judge double. Then, the league leader in RBI Sir Didi Gregorius added another one to his tally when he smoked a single to left that plated Gardner to give the Yanks a one-run advantage.Then in the bottom of the fourth, rookie sensation Gleyber Torres collected his first big league steak when he stung a single up the middle that scored Neil Walker to extend their lead out to two. Although he was able to get a double play to escape the fourth, Berrios needed to use 87 pitches before starting the fifth inning.Yes In-DidiI can\u2019t even make this stuff up, but Didi Gregorius did it again.The long ball was Didi\u2019s team-leading eighth blast of the season, raising his AL-leading RBI total to 27. He is most definitely making this sports writer look like a genius since I predicted that the shortstop would make his first All-Star team this year.CC Stands for Completely CruisingEven though his counterpart was getting roughed up tonight, Carsten Charles Sabathia was once again sensational. The veteran sailed through six frames of one-run ball, allowing just two hits with one walk and four strikeouts.Coming out to relieve Sabathia to begin the seventh, Dellin Betances\u2019 season-long struggles continued as the righty was subject to the third and fourth errors of the night for New York that led to Minnesota scoring another run to make the score 5-2. When manager Aaron Boone came out to get his 6-foot-8 reliever, the Bronx faithful surely let Betances hear it: Giancarlo style.David Robertson was called upon to save the day after Betances\u2019 miserable appearance and proceeded to get a strikeout and a comebacker ground out to end the Minnesota threat and the frame.Bombs AwayJust when it felt like the Twins were making a comeback, Aaron Judge got that run back in the bottom of the seventh. And it goes a little something like this.Not to be outdone by his friend, Gary Sanchez said, \u201cI\u2019ll have another.\u201d The second home run by Sanchez brought the Yankees season total to seven multi-home run games this season, tops in all of baseball and the only team in Major League history to ever do it in their first 22 games of a season. Sanchez also became the youngest player in the history of the game to collect nine multi-home run games.If Gary is indeed heating up; look out, American League.Despite Chasen Shreve surrendering another run to Minnesota in the top of the eighth to make it 8-3, Jonathan Holder came on to close the door on Minnesota\u2019s hopes of making a comeback.With a victory tomorrow, the Yankees would lock down their second consecutive four-game series victory. Headed to the bump in attempts to collect that W will be right-hander Sonny Gray (1-1, 8.27 ERA), who will be looking to try and right the ship on his 2018 campaign. Minnesota sends their offseason acquisition Lance Lynn (0-1, 6.00 ERA) to the mound to try and silence this rolling Yankee offense.

After a marvelous 11-year career Nick Mangold officially signed a one-day contract to retire a member of the New York Jets. Mangold said it was the third contract he had signed, but the first time he signed one while holding his child.The presser lasted 1082 seconds, not nearly enough time to tell the full Mangold story.     But here\u2019s a spoiler alert, the story may not be over just yet. You may want to call this next chapter a mystery because nothing has been confirmed, but just enough to titillate the senses.If you remember in his retirement announcement on social media he gave us this juicy nugget:\u201cMy biggest regret is not bringing the Lombardi Trophy to New York, but, as I retire, I will continue my efforts to bring the Trophy home in a different capacity. I have no idea what that capacity is but I\u2019m sure I will figure something out in the future.\u201dA different capacity you say? Like coaching or a personnel role perhaps?I feel sad for guys like Mangold who gave everything he had to this organization and got on the doorstep a few times, but couldn\u2019t come away with that Lombardi Trophy. But the thought that Mangold could suit back up for the Jets, not in a uniform, but maybe in a suit and tie is actually exciting.\u201cWell my golf game has really suffered because of football, so I\u2019m looking forward to improving that. But after that, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s funny that you retire and your \u2018career\u2019 is over at 34 when there\u2019s so much left to do. I don\u2019t know what the future holds. Right now I\u2019m enjoying my time with my kids and I\u2019m going to continue doing that.\u201dHe was noncommittal, but the social media post speaks volumes. He isn\u2019t quite ready to jump from his playing career to the coaching staff just yet.I mean Mangold still hasn\u2019t technically even graduated college yet, so he\u2019s going to go back and do that. Mangold is going to enjoy time with his kids, but he revealed he\u2019s staying in the area and isn\u2019t going anywhere.Thank goodness\u2026It reminds me of the Chad Pennington situation. I spoke with multiple people close to Pennington and the only reason he isn\u2019t back in an official capacity with the team is because of his kids and his coaching duties locally. But when his kids grow up a little bit and when he feels ready, I fully anticipate that Pennington will return to the organization, most likely in a coaching role.While Mangold could certainly join the front office or as a coach. I mean this offensive line needs work and even if Mangold waits a few years, the offensive line will still probably need work. The door will always be open for former players to come back. This is also a good message to other former players that there\u2019s always a home on 1 Jets Drive.I think acting Owner Christopher Johnson put it best, \u2018Mangold will be a New York Jet forever.\u2019  According to Nick Mangold himself, he has been released by the New York Jets on Saturday.New York Jets center Nick Mangold says he'll be with the team that drafted him next season and\u2026Only Nick Mangold could turn an unfortunate situation into gold.

{"content": "Things haven\u2019t gone quite as well for the New York Mets ever since they lost in heartbreaking fashion to the Washington Nationals just over a week ago. Is this a temporary issue or is there more to it?There are so many games during the MLB season that a successful team doesn\u2019t have time to examine each contest. However, there are certain outcomes\u2014like the New York Mets loss to the Washington Nationals on April 16\u2014that can linger and take away good or bad momentum, swinging the pendulum.Back on April 16, the Mets and ace Jacob deGrom took a 6-1 lead over the Nationals into the eighth inning at Citi Field. After allowing two of the first three batters in the top of the eighth to reach base, manager Mickey Callaway pulled deGrom and called upon Seth Lugo.Lugo lasted just one batter, throwing nothing but balls and walking Trea Turner to load the bases. Callaway then went to left-handed specialist Jerry Blevins, who promptly served up a two-run single to Bryce Harper.     Callaway once again went to the mound and replaced Blevins with A.J. Ramos. Ramos struck out Ryan Zimmerman but then allowed a single to Pedro Severino and walked pinch-hitter (and former Met) Matt Reynolds, making it a 6-4 game.Having seen enough of Ramos, Callaway went to his closer, Jeurys Familia, to get a four-out save. Such a situation separates the true closers from the phony ones. Callaway had already used Familia two previous times in the eighth inning this season.He had been unhittable up to this point, totaling 10 innings, saving seven games, allowing just four hits, not allowing a run and striking out 12. However, on this day, he was off. Familia allowed his first three batters to reach base, turning a 6-4 lead into a 7-6 deficit.As the Mets came to bat in the bottom of the eighth, they saw a possible 13-2 record and seven-game lead over the defending National League East champions slipping away. The Nationals added a run in the top of the ninth to defeat the Mets 8-6.Mets fans were interested to see Callaway, a rookie manager, would handle his first failure as skipper. After all, up until that point, most of his pitching changes worked. Is the bullpen being overused?Before deGrom\u2019s start against Washington, Zack Wheeler was the only Mets starter to go longer than six innings in a game. That the bullpen imploded in an outing that saw a Mets starter go deeper than any of his rotation-mates was ironic.Could Callaway be using his bullpen too much? Monday\u2019s loss to the Nationals was a perfect example of over-managing. Using four pitchers trying to hold a five-run lead seemed a bit desperate.Including that loss to the Nationals, the Mets bullpen has gone 2-2 with a 9.00 ERA, 1.84 WHIP and blown two saves over their past six games. Prior to that, the Mets bullpen was 6-0 with a 1.52 ERA, 1.11 WHIP and had blown just two saves in 14 games.We\u2019ve yet to reach May and already, four relievers have appeared in at least 50 percent of the teams\u2019 games. Three have appeared in over 60 percent. How long can that hold up? Jeurys Familia has already been asked to record a four-out save four times.Unfortunately for Callaway, this is the result of being a manager. When you are winning, all your moves make you look like a genius that re-invented the game.

It\u2019s what we lean on when we face an obstacle or any friction that makes the achievement of our goal difficult or inconvenient.Give this a try \u2014 spend a few minutes together answering this question: Why is date night important to us?When Marc and I started our date night habit over a decade ago, we were working at a company owned by a husband-wife team. Rich and Sue Robbins were not only our bosses and friends, but they were true role models in a multitude of ways. After nearly 20 years together, the Robbins\u2019 marriage was still fun, connective and light. Date night, they told us, was a cornerstone of that connectivity. As a newly married couple, Marc and I very much admired the bond they had created and so readily sought to solidify our date night habit. Our \u201cwhy\u201d was that we could see where we wanted our marriage to be in 20 years and we knew intentionally setting aside \u201cus time\u201d was one way we could get there.So, what\u2019s your why?

{"content": "Steak is one of the culinary processed meat that became a favorite of many people. Although food that usually uses beef as its main ingredient is more often considered as high class food because the price is not cheap.To anticipate this, some people with their creativity to make Indonesian-style steaks, the meat steak is floured with flour. The shape will resemble chicken katsu, but with beef.In contrast to Indonesian-style steak, Western-style steak really serves cuts of whole beef that has been seasoned before. Usually this Western-style steak is equipped with a few pieces of potatoes and vegetables.In addition, steaks are also served with different levels of maturity. What are they? Let's see the explanation below that brilio.net lansir from resepkoki.id.1. Rare.Steak with the lowest level of maturity is commonly called rare. Where steak meat is served only cooked on the outside only. So about 80% of the inside is still red alias immature. Generally to get this level of maturity the meat on the inside should be at a temperature of about 48-50 degrees Celsius. To check it you can use a food thermometer and check it when the meat has just been moved from the top of the grill pan to the plate. Well, this level of maturity is usually most favored by westerners because they assume that the meat is very soft and juicy.2. Medium Rare.{\"width\":1000,\"web_uri\":\"005ae1986a7fc0a73143\",\"height\":750,\"description\":\"photo: uk.businessinsider.com\"}Maturity level of medium rare is actually almost similar to rare. But the difference is more mature meat in number more. When compared with rare, only about 60% of the meat inside is still red. The level of maturity is also often called the steak is half cooked has a meat texture that is also juicy and soft. When checked using a food thermometer, the inner meat of medium rare must be 55-60 degrees Celsius.3. Medium.Medium steak meat has more brown color with slightly red inside, about 40%. Maturity level of medium steak meat become the standard delicacy of steak meat in various countries. But of course the texture of medium meat is not as juicy rare or medium rare again. The inner meat will be 60-55 degrees Celsius when the food thermometer is measured. This level of maturity according to Asian steak lovers is the most favorite and delicious level to enjoy steak meat.4. Medium Well.{\"width\":450,\"web_uri\":\"005ae199cd3e40920fdf\",\"height\":300,\"description\":\"photo: certifiedangusbeef.co\"}Well the level of maturity of medium-well steak meat is a level that can begin to be accepted in the tongue of Indonesia. The meat is almost completely cooked but there is still a bit of red part on the inside, which is about 20%. In addition, although it is almost entirely cooked, the texture of the meat still feels a bit juicy. Usually the inner meat will be around 65-69 degrees Celsius when measured food thermometer.5. Well Done.In steak meat with a well done level of maturity will not be found in the slightest red hue on the inside. This level of maturity is the level of perfect maturity aka completely thorough. But the texture of the meat is certainly harder and is not juicy anymore because all the fat is roasted out. Appearance medium medium steak meat that is brown color and rather dry.

{"content": "Shalom brothers and sisters. Today is Thursday, April 26, 2018.Today\u2019s Bible Verse: Matthew 6:30-34Verse Text: [Matthew 6:30-34 KJV] 30 Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, [shall he] not much more [clothe] you, O ye of little faith? 31 Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed? 32 (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things. 33 But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you. 34 Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day [is] the evil thereof.From the Believer\u2019s Bible:\u201cIn this passage Jesus strikes at the tendency to center our lives around food and clothing, thus missing life's real meaning. The problem is not so much what we eat and wear today, but what we shall eat and wear ten, twenty, or thirty years from now. Such worry about the future is sin because it denies the love, wisdom, and power of God. It denies the love of God by implying that He doesn't care for us. It denies His wisdom by implying that He doesn't know what He is doing. And it denies His power by implying that He isn't able to provide for our needs.This type of worry causes us to devote our finest energies to making sure we will have enough to live on. Then before we know it, our lives have passed, and we have missed the central purpose for which we were made. God did not create us in His image with no higher destiny than that we should consume food. We are here to love, worship, and serve Him and to represent His interests on earth. Our bodies are intended to be our servants, not our masters.\u201dThis is so true. There are people that plan their lives down to the finest detail and it seems that Our Father is nowhere in those plans. Do you know what Our Father does with our plans? He laughs at them.We are told in this passage that Our Father will take care of us if we seek His kingdom. We seek His kingdom through our love for Him and we show that love through keeping His Torah. I hope this has been a blessing to you. May the rest of your day be blessed. Shalom.",  "id": "135"}
{"content": "2018/04/26 \nAww! Animals! \n\n\nNEW YORK \u2014 Rats are growing bigger by the minute from feasting on trash outside a Chipotle restaurant in Brooklyn Heights. This has been witnessed by the fast food restaurant's fuming neighbors.According to the neighbors, Chipotle workers dump bags of garbage in front of the eatery at around 6 p.m. every day, and that gives the rats just enough time to eat before the garbage men arrive. A resident told the Brooklyn Daily Eagle that he sees four or five rats going back and forth from garbage to the building next door under construction, and he wonders how big the rat tribe has grown. And one construction worker told the Brooklyn Daily Eagle that he spotted a giant rat that was bigger than a cat, or the size of a well stuffed burrito.Chipotle's manager said the ratzilla situation happened only after a new construction at a nearby location started. The manager also said she has seen the giant rats biting through garbage bags and they are particularly aggressive to passers-by.Brooklynites are urging Chipotle to put its trash in ratproof containers. Who knows, maybe it's only a matter of time before these giant rodents move on to their next target \u2014 humans.Prevent that from happening, a company rep told the New York Post that they will start using secure garbage cans to keep these hairy monsters away.

Shelling out hundreds of dollars for the sleek device only to receive a proprietary cable that is usually tangled up and/or falling apart is honestly an injustice, and we should not stand for it.\n\nUntil Apple decides to step up and improve their deplorable power cords, you'd be better off juicing up your precious iPhone with the HoverDock. It's a slick, minimalist dock that complements your smartphone's look and makes your desk or bedside table appear like that of a real adult. It has a sturdy aluminum base and an upright stance, allowing you to still see your screen even while charging, along with a swivel base that is ideal for Facetime or video conferencing.\nOh yeah, and it's also currently on sale for 28% off.\nThe Hoverdock's clever design also eliminates cord rage. It features a cable storage system to keep the wire out of the way, killing any possibility of pulls, spills, bumps, and any other unforeseen accidents. Plus, it works with AirPods, the iPad, Magic Keyboard, Magic Mouse, Magic TrackPad, Apple TV Remote, and basically any Lightning-powered device.\nImage: Just Mobile",  "id": "139"}
{"content": "CITRUS HEIGHTS, Calif. \u2014 The man who authorities said Wednesday is among the worst serial killers and rapists in U.S. history is a 72-year-old Vietnam War veteran, former police officer and grandfather who lived in a tidy, suburban California home with a neatly kept green lawn.Joseph James DeAngelo was described Wednesday as an odd but decent neighbor in the Sacramento suburb of Citrus Heights. Neighbors said he mostly kept to himself, but was quick to anger and could often be heard loudly cussing in frustration over a landscaping issue or other minor annoyance.\"You can tell he's a very meticulous person,\" said neighbor Kevin Tapia. \"His house is always perfectly painted. His grass is always cut. He gets down around all the rocks on his lawn and is cutting to make sure it's just perfect.\"Another neighbor, Natalia Bedes-Correnti, said DeAngelo appeared to be a \"nice old grandpa\" but he cursed loudly and often over misplaced car keys and the like. She said one of DeAngelo's adult daughters and a granddaughter lived with him in the neighborhood where children ride their bikes home from school.\"He liked the F word a lot,\" Bedes-Correnti said.His history also shows a seemingly ordinary life for the man police are now linking to crimes committed by the suspect variously known as the Golden State Killer, the East Area Rapist and the Original Night Stalker. Investigators towed away two cars, a Volvo and a Toyota along with a fishing boat DeAngelo kept in his three-car garage. Neighbors also said he owned a motorcycle. The Associated Press Sacramento County Sheriff Scott Jones talks to reporters about the arrest Joesph James DeAngelo, seen in photo, on suspicion of committing a string of violent crimes in the 1970's and 1980's after a news\u2026 Neighbor Barbara Wammer, 73, said DeAngelo built model airplanes that can be flown by remote control in the home he owned since 1983. She described him as a typical neighbor who was often outside working on his lawn. \"There was no reason to be suspicious,\" she said.DeAngelo graduated from nearby Folsom High School in 1964 and joined the U.S. Navy.A local newspaper in 1967 reported that DeAngelo served aboard the cruiser USS Canberra as a repairman off the coast of North Vietnam.After returning home he enrolled in a nearby community college and then transferred to California State University, Sacramento, where he graduated in 1972 with a bachelor of science degree in criminal justice, school spokeswoman Anita Fitzhugh said.Soon he landed a job as a police officer in the small Central Valley city of Exeter, 45 miles (72 kilometers) south of Fresno, where he served from 1973 to 1976, \"around the time of the Visalia Ransacker cases,\" another name affiliated with the same attacker, Sacramento Sheriff Scott Jones said.He married a Citrus Heights woman seven years his junior in 1973, according to a marriage notice in the Auburn Journal.In 1976, DeAngelo took a job with the Auburn Police Department about 30 miles (48 kilometers) north of Sacramento.\"Very often serial killers are very interested in police work, they tend to have an obsession with it and they tend to study it,\" said Scott Bonn, a criminologist and author of \"Why We Love Serial Killers\" and other similar books.The Auburn Journal in June 1979 published a photo of DeAngelo in uniform preparing for the annual \"Fuzz Ball\" fundraising baseball game.A few months later the department fired him after he was caught shoplifting a hammer and dog repellent.~ msn.com",  "id": "140"}

A perfect option for those dreaming of seeing the underwater world but are too scared to try diving.Labassin Waterfall, the PhilippinesThere is a resort called Villa Escudero in the Philippines where you can visit the Labassin Waterfall restaurant that is located at the foot of a small waterfall. The tables are standing right in the water and the restaurant is mostly visited by tourists who want to try Philippine cuisine in an unusual environment.The Grotto, ThailandThe Grotto, a romantic restaurant, is located in a limestone cave on the Phra Nang beach in Thailand. It belongs to the Rayavadee resort, but anyone can reserve a table even if they aren\u2019t guests of the resort. Their signature dish is grilled seafood that is served in the evenings several times a week. At other times, guests are offered light snacks and desserts.Treepod Dining, ThailandIt seems that the owner of this restaurant probably thought \u201cHaving lunch in a bird\u2019s nest? Why not?\u201d The restaurant belongs to Soneva Kiri Eco Resort in Thailand and we\u2019d guess that the waiters there never get bored \u2014 the dishes are served with the help of a zip line to 3 \u2019nests\u2019 at the height of 16 ft.Ice Restaurant, FinlandThe village of Santa Claus in Finland attracts many tourists annually.

A bar and lounge area are also available here.Dinner in the Sky, 45 countriesThe founders of the Dinner in the Sky concept prove that even a platform suspended on a construction crane can be a restaurant. Belgium is the motherland of this project, but their restaurants are already popping up in 45 countries around the world. By the way, even if you\u2019re not afraid of high prices and places, they\u2019ve got their own rules for you to be able to dine with them: the height of a diner should be at least 4\u20199\u2033 so that they can be fastened to the seat properly.The Colonial Tramcar Restaurant, AustraliaThe visitors of this restaurant get a double benefit \u2014 they enjoy the beautiful scenery of Melbourne and its suburbs, as well as being able to dine in the stylish retro tram\u2019s interior. The restaurant arranges gala dinners and closed receptions like morning tea or breakfast.Trinity Place Restaurant, USAIn 1904 it used to be the largest and most secure bank safe in the world, but today it\u2019s been turned into a nice meeting and dining place in New York City. Having lunch in an old safe behind 35-ton walls... We bet its creators would never imagine it would be used this way.Le Panoramic, FranceThe signature feature of this restaurant is the 360\u00b0 view showing Mont Blanc. A stunning mountain view from the altitude of 8,963 ft is enough to impress its visitors. However, that\u2019s not where the owners stopped \u2014 you can even try exquisite delicacies here, like foie gras.The Rock Restaurant, Zanzibar, TanzaniaThe name of the restaurant speaks for itself \u2014 it was opened right on top of a rock formation that juts out of the water. Apparently, there wasn\u2019t even enough space for 20 tables, but that doesn\u2019t matter much.

{"content": "Despite the fact that Snap Inc.'s Spectacles product weren't the hit some were expecting, the company is nevertheless taking another swing at it by releasing an updated version.On Thursday, Snap Inc. revealed a new version of Spectacles. No, the new version still doesn't do augmented reality (yet), but it does come with a couple of improvements.The new version is water resistant, has a smaller profile in terms of fit (making the frame about one-third smaller, thanks to streamlined internal electronics), and features improved audio via dual microphones. Along with the new hardware functionality, the company claims that the device will also transfer your Snaps to the Snapchat app up to \"four times\" faster than before (now a three second transfer, up from the previous nine second time lag). In addition to the updated specifications, the new version of Spectacles will be offered in several new colors (onyx, ruby, and sapphire), an offer two lens shades for each color. The company has also partnered with Lensabl to provide prescription and polarized lenses to Spectacles buyers. As for the reports, backed by founder Evan Spiegel himself, that sales of Spectacles version one weren't great, despite all the excitement around the device, the company addressed that as well.\"We anticipate being better able to predict demand this time around and will be managing orders from our suppliers with this knowledge,\" said a Snap Inc. spokesperson in a statement. \"As one example, by only selling Spectacles through Spectacles.com we can more accurately measure demand. When we launched the first version, we were almost exclusively selling through Snapbots \u2014 this generated a lot of hype, but it was ultimately hard to measure actual demand accurately.\" Sales of the original device reached just 220,000, which might be a win for a tiny company, but fell far short for a public company with the reach and influence of Snap Inc. Now, with the release of version two (and an AR version almost certainly coming down the line), we'll have another chance to see if Snapchat's wearable tech aspirations are on the mark, or just more an investment in a future its users can't quite see yet.    \n \n \n \n ",  "id": "157"}

{"content": "Subway is set to close about 500 stores this year. And that's after closing over 800 stores last year in an effort to fight flagging sales. According to Bloomberg, Subway's sales fell 4.4 percent last year.Subway CEO Suzanne Greco told Bloomberg that the company also plans to move some of its locations to more prime areas in an effort to add more customers. \u201cWe want to be sure that we have the best location,\u201d Greco told Bloomberg. \u201cWe focused in the past on restaurant count. We\u2019re focused now on strengthening market share.\u201d\nAccording to Bloomberg, the fast-food chain recently introduced a new loyalty program and has remodeled several stores to encourage customers to come back. The loyalty program is currently available in all their U.S. and Canada locations and offers special discounts and free items in-store like drinks, cookies, and even subs.Remodeled stores will add touch-screen ordering kiosks, USB charging ports, neon logos throughout the restaurant, and a station where customers can pick up their online orders.In life and in food, don\u2019t take what you are given.

She says these competitors are making the company find ways to serve customrs faster and more efficiently. \nThough Subway is closing locations in the United States, it's actually expanding overseas. The chain will add more than 1,000 locations abroad including the U.K., South Korea, China, and other India. According to Business Insider, Subway has 25,835 locations in the United States, which is even more than McDonald's. Some franchise owners told the site the store count was a problem from the beginning, as locations began competing against each other for sales. They also complained that lack of new items and special deals have made it hard for them to generate a profit and bring back customers.\"This year, it's going to be more [locations shutting down]\", one franchisee told Business Insider. \"There's not a connection, I feel, with the demographics and the target.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n",  "id": "175"}
{"content": "There has been much chatter in the recent weeks about System Of A Down, with the band recently teasing \"something\" on their Twitter account. Many fans speculated, incredibly optimistically, that the quartet would be releasing new music. Turns out it was a countdown to an announcement of very limited tour dates. There is some good news, though, for fans of the members' side projects. Guitarist Daron Malakian is back with new music with his band Scars On Broadway. \n\nRecorded in sessions dating back to 2012, Malakian on Monday released the video for a new song called \"Lives.\" With the heavy driving riff leading the charge in his new track, Malakian stamps his signature sound that we've missed in the last decade. As a fan of System Of A Down, and with no new music from them coming in the near future, one can't help but wonder, \"Why shouldn't this be an SOAD song?\" Regardless, Scars On Broadway stands on its own two feet and Malakian's ability to write incredible songs will make the upcoming album Dictator a much anticipated record. Malakian also revealed that he is working with his band and will record another record very soon. \n\nIn a recent interview with Rolling Stone, Malakian describes the song's meaning and also joins in the speculating upon the fate of System Of A Down. \n\n I recorded the album and then around that time System started playing live again. So every time we'd play live, there'd be conversations like, 'Maybe we'll do an album.' So being the guy who wrote the majority of almost all the System songs in the past, I was like, 'Alright, let me see what's happening with it. Let me hold onto these songs and let me see how this develops.' We talked about it and we weren't all on the same page. Not everybody was into the idea. But every time we played live, it kept coming up.\n\nI just got to the point now where a lot of people were asking about the Scars album \u2013 I hear it all the time \u2013 so I was like, 'I'm gonna put this album out.' Not knowing what's happening with System has kept me from putting my own stuff out. Too much time has passed, and I'm really excited to finally get some music out finally.\n\n\nSo, that's the reason why the Scars On Broadway website has been the same for several years, teasing an EP and an album that are finally coming! Dictator will be available on July 20. The new single is about the Armenian genocide and its survivors. The video features beautifully choreographed Armenian folk dancing, perfectly in tune and appropriate for the song. Watch the video for \"Lives\" below:\n\n",  "id": "176"}

{"content": "The Wait for the Remake May Be a Very Long One\nThe Final Fantasy VII remake may be farther away than fans anticipated, if a new interview with a Japanese developer holds any water. According to Reddit user Dan Tsusaka, a 3D artist working in Tokyo, Square Enix was forced to reboot development after arresting the property from CyberConnect 2.\nReports were spotted first on ResetEra, an interview in which Tsusaka gave insider knowledge on the state of FFVII development. By his account, Square Enix employed developer CyberConnect 2 for the Final Fantasy VII remake only long enough to regret it. Not only was Square Enix disappointed by the work, but, judging by the interview, it seems assets from the past two years were scrapped. Very little, if any, of CyberConnect 2\u2019s work shall be reused following the shift to in-house development. Hence, a mid-development reboot fits the bill if the report rings true. Tsukasa said the following:\n\n\n\u201c[Square Enix] don\u2019t have 4 years of work, they have 2. The announcement that square was taking the game away from Cyberconnect2, they didn\u2019t take it away and continue it, they started it again because CyberConnect\u2019s work was just so useless and not far enough along, but still far enough along that remaking it was faster than refactoring it\u2026 (it wasn\u2019t in a good state at all).\n\u201cI\u2019ll explain it this way. When has a company taking work away from another company ever been a positive sign of things? I know CyberConnects work was unusable, I\u2019ve worked with them before, I know their level.\n\u201cAnd I know they outsourced to hell and back in order to get things to the point we saw them publicly, and it still wasn\u2019t enough to save them\n\u201cI\u2019m not speculating though. I\u2019ve worked with these people and know people working still at both square and CC2, I\u2019m explaining what happened from what I know.\u201d\nOf course, we encourage readers to take every word with a healthy grain of salt. While social media rumors often bear no weight, we took into account the fact that figures such as Swery and ex-FFXV Lead Designer Wan Hazmer follow the source on Twitter. Furthermore, before today, we heard prevalent whispers of development issues, especially after SE job postings searching for \u201ccore members\u201d surfaced.

{"content": "TV has been with us for a long time, and it might seem odd to even think about a time when every home didn\u2019t have at least one television device. Broadcast TV as we know it today is a far cry from the first television receivers that operated in only black and white, with only a very limited reception and a terrible visual screen.\n\n\n\n\n\nGet The Timeless Reading eBook in PDF\nGet the entire 10-part series on Timeless Reading in PDF. Save it to your desktop, read it on your tablet, or email to your colleagues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Birth of Television \nThe first televisions were prohibitively expensive, and it took several years and a lot of refining before the TV became the 'must have' item for every home. However, television captured our imagination and by the 1970\u2019s statistics showed that many homes were still without an indoor toilet or fridge, but most had a working TV.\nIt didn\u2019t take long for advertisers to realise that television was the perfect medium for getting their message out to the wide world easily and quickly. The television advert was born and has stayed with us over several decades, with many TV channels and programs being funded solely by advertising revenue, but over recent years the way the public view and use TV has changed dramatically.\nOn-Demand Entertainment \nThe increased and improved internet connections that most people now have access to, have turned the tide on normal viewing and the incredible rise of the social media trend now gives access to TV and news information in a totally different way.\nThe general public are no longer willing to wait for the information that they require, and the increased use of apps to enable the sifting of such information has given viewers the capability to pick and choose how, what and when they see any relevant content.\nResearch from price comparison experts Money Guru indicates that 1 in 5 people have never watched live TV. The ability to stream, record and view information programs including news on devices like smartphones and tablets has brought with it a new freedom.\nObviously, the decrease in normal television viewing has had a knock-on effect on the way advertising is used and the latest way to promote consumer goods is to use product placement.\n2017 was the first time that advertisers spent more of digital advertising space than on the traditional style of TV adverts.\nWhat Next For TV?\nSo where does all this change leave normal broadcast TV and what does the future hold? Will TV as we know it become obsolete or can it change with the times and evolve? The answers to these questions are still very much under debate with many having the opinion that TV has weathered such storms before with the introduction of cable TV for instance, and still come out victorious, whilst others firmly believe that standard broadcast TV has run its course and will soon be replaced by a more modern and up-to-date viewing medium.\nThe huge increase in streaming programs like Netflix, HULU, YouTube and Amazon have given people the viewing access they want, whilst the newer Smart TV\u2019s give internet access, music on demand and news programs as and when required. In fact, Money Guru\u2019s research shows that those who watch live TV at least once a week has shrunk from 92% to\u00a080%.\nHowever, if TV broadcasters keep evolving using the latest technologies, applications and keep abreast of the innovative trends in viewing, then the future of broadcast TV need not be a dark place.\n",  "id": "182"}

The news, a major loss for Tesla, was first reported by Electrek.Keller has had crucial roles in overseeing some of the major tech projects of the last decade. Before Tesla, he played a major role in Apple's development of A4 and A5 processors, the processors that powered many Apple mobile devices from 2010 to 2012. And before that, he worked at chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), developing the Zen computer processor microarchitecture.At the time of his hiring, Tesla said that \"Jim will bring together the best internal and external hardware technologies to develop the safest, most advanced autopilot systems in the world.\"During that time, Autopilot as seen both successes and failures. While the Autopilot feature is generally \"reliable and pleasantly novel,\" every time the hardware fails it flies in the face of some of the grandiose claims the company's CEO, Elon Musk has made. A crash into a fire truck earlier this year showed that the work is far from done. In a press statement, the company said that \"prior to joining Tesla, Jim\u2019s core passion was microprocessor engineering and he\u2019s now joining a company where he\u2019ll be able to once again focus on this exclusively. We appreciate his contributions to Tesla and wish him the best.\u201dLosing a chip architect of Keller's stature would be a loss for any company, and in Tesla's case represents only the latest high-level employee loss in recent years. The California company has recently parted ways with its top sales executive and chief financial officer as well. But it's not like Tesla is having any trouble recruiting top-tier talent. Keller is getting replaced by Pete Bannon, who has quite the industry stature in his own right. A spokesman for the company says thatPete Bannon, who has been at Tesla for over two years, will now lead Autopilot hardware. Pete has been building processors since 1984, co-led the development of Apple\u2019s A5 chip and then continued development through to the A9 chip. Prior to Apple, Pete was the VP of architecture and verification at PA Semi. Andrej Karpathy, Tesla\u2019s Director of AI and Autopilot Vision, will now have overall responsibility for all Autopilot software.At Intel, Keller will be reuniting with Intel\u2019s chief chip architect Raja Koduri. Keller and Koduri worked together at AMD and at Apple. The band having gotten back together, the two will work on new products at Intel, according to the Wall Street Journal.Source: Electrek\n\n\n\n\n\n",  "id": "187"}

God says if you don\u2019t take one day out of seven to rest, if you keep pumping the adrenaline all day, every day, seven days a week, your engine is going to explode somehow. So your best requires rest. You have to take the time to rest.2. Recharge your emotions.Just be quiet! Or maybe you need to reconnect in your relationships. Maybe there\u2019s some kind of recreation that rejuvenates you. I\u2019m not talking about competitive recreation. Some of you aren\u2019t recharging your emotions out on the golf course. You\u2019re just getting angry at the other guy!3. Refocus your spirit.During your Sabbath, you don\u2019t take a day off from God. You worship! Worship puts life into perspective. If you\u2019re too busy for God, you\u2019re just too busy. To make this happen, you have to schedule it. Psalm 127:2 says, \u201cIt\u2019s useless to rise early and go to bed late, and work your worried fingers to the bone. Don\u2019t you know he enjoys giving rest to those he loves?\u201d (MSG)God enjoys giving rest to those he loves. Be intentional about taking your Sabbath, and make it count!Dear Lord, help me to make every Sabbath about you. Quiet my heart, give rest to my soul, and refocus my spirit\u2014for true renewal comes only from you. Holy Spirit please help me to be intentional with my time and worship, and encourage me to find rest in you alone. In Jesus\u2019 name, Amen.  ",  "id": "190"}

Let the flames die down and the coals turn ashen, then mound the coal up on one side. If using a small barbecue, you will have to remove the grills and place a sturdy roasting tin on the floor of the barbecue, next to the coals \u2013 this will give you space to close the lid once the chicken is in. If you have a large barbecue, the chicken can sit directly on the grills (or on a tray on the grills, so that it doesn\u2019t topple over.)    To make the rub, mix all the ingredients together with a good grinding of black pepper. Drizzle the chicken with the oil, sprinkle over the rub and massage it into the skin, making sure you get into all the nooks and crannies, even inside the cavity.    Use a can opener to take off the top of the can of beer. Pour out half the beer (tip into a glass to drink!) and leave the rest in the can, as it will keep the chicken moist while it cooks. Pop the chicken onto the can, legs down, so that it looks like it is sitting upright with the can in its cavity. Stand the chicken and can upright on the barbecue, either in the roasting tin or directly on the grill, on the side with no coals. Close the lid and cook for 1 hr 20 mins until the chicken is browned, the meat tender and the juices run clear. If the juices aren\u2019t clear, cook for a further 10 mins, then check again. (To cook in the oven, heat to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Sit the chicken on a baking tray, place in the bottom of the oven, and follow the same cooking time.)    Remove the chicken from the barbecue, cover lightly with foil and leave to rest for 20 mins before serving.",  "id": "192"}
{"content": "Traveling has never been so accessible, so it\u2019s unsurprising that more and more people are deciding to spend at least some of their lives exploring as much of the world as they can. Today, traveling isn\u2019t just limited to vacations \u2013 those who want to make money as they go to keep themselves on the road for as long as possible have several awesome options to choose from. Whether you\u2019d prefer to be your own boss or would rather find secure, paid employment in the destinations that you\u2019re staying in, here are some great career ideas for anybody who loves to travel. #1. Healthcare:\nWorking in the healthcare industry pretty much guarantees you a job almost anywhere. Across the globe, dedicated healthcare professionals are always in high demand, particularly in developing countries, where health resources are often sparse, and healthcare facilities suffer from a dire lack of educated and experienced professionals. You don\u2019t have to spend years earning a medical or nursing degree, either \u2013 kick start your career in healthcare today at one of these reputable Maine Phlebotomy Schools. \n#2. Teaching:\nIf you speak English as your native language, then one of the easiest jobs to get as a globetrotter is teaching English as a foreign language. Today, English is one of the most widely-spoken languages worldwide, so there\u2019s high demand for quality English tuition in almost every country that you could visit. As a teacher, you could be based in a school, an English education center, or you could work for yourself and teach your students privately. Although it\u2019s possible to find work with no official qualifications, the ability to speak English fluently isn\u2019t usually enough on its own. You\u2019ll improve your chances of finding teaching jobs with a globally recognized qualification such as the Teaching English as a Foreign Language (TEFL) certificate. \n#3. Travel Blogging:\nIf you love writing and making videos about your travels, you might want to consider making an income as a travel blogger. This is a great choice for anybody who wants the freedom that comes with a \u2018digital nomad\u2019 lifestyle, since you\u2019re fully in control of when, where and how you want to work. Blogging or vlogging also means that you\u2019re not tied down to employment in any one place \u2013 you can move on as quickly or as slowly as you like. \n#4. Freelancing:\nAnother work-for-yourself option that you might want to consider is becoming an online freelancer. Today, an increasing number of employers favor hiring freelancers over taking on full-time staff, due to a range of benefits including reduced costs and the ability to choose from a larger talent pool. If you have a skill such as writing, graphic design, web design, social media management, or customer service, you can put any of these to use online, working with various clients on a pay-per-project basis. This means you can enjoy the freedom of self-employment whilst still getting regular work and income. \nDon\u2019t let work hold you back from traveling the world \u2013 take it with you!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n",  "id": "193"}

The carmaker did not make any official statements. It is known that Keller left the company a month after the deadly accident involving a car Model X, and his place was taken by a former Apple engineer Pete Bannon, who moved to Tesla in 2016.But in this case, not so interesting is the fact of Keller's departure, which previously headed the development of AMD Zen architecture, from Tesla, but the fact that his new place of work be Intel. Especially considering that recently Intel hired several leading experts, who previously worked in AMD. Recall, at the end of last year, AMD left its chief specialist for graphics solutions Raja Koduri, who led the new graphic division of Intel. In addition, it is assumed that Chris Hook, who recently left AMD after 20 years of work, also went to Intel.According to thematic sources, all these personnel migrations clearly indicate that Intel is preparing \"something grandiose.\" It is possible that Koduri is assembling a team to develop a radically new x86-compatible processor architecture from a clean slate.

The only way to achieve \u2018scale\u2019 and more impressions is by manufacturing it.\u201d\nAd fraud detection vendors\u201cVendors are cashing in on the fraud problem, and the companies paying for it are not getting what they thought they were buying (protection against fraud). The bad guys and the tech they use are far superior to fraud and bot detection companies\u2019 tech, so most fraud gets marked as clean, and the client (marketer) continues to get ripped off, thinking they are fine. Bad guys simply get a subscription to the fraud detection vendors and A/B test their bots and fraud methods to ensure they get marked as clean (or they get a friend to get a subscription). \u2026 [Companies] are paying for fraud detection services that don\u2019t work, and they are still getting ripped off.\u201d\nPremium publishers benefiting from ad fraud\u201cFor good publishers who can survive until then, there is a lot more money coming back their way when marketers wake up and realize all of this digital programmatic stuff was a complete scam, and there aren\u2019t 100 billion unique users going on the internet and generating the 70 trillion ad impressions every year that they are buying.

{"content": "It\u2019s been widely speculated that Baker Mayfield and the New York Jets were the perfect Cinderella pairing. But it looks like the clock just struck midnight. \u2018Broadway\u2019 Baker Mayfield just has a nice ring to it. It also seems like the New York Jets have agreed with that sentiment over the last several weeks.The team has openly and privately gushed about his swagger, his accuracy and his ability to galvanize a team. Those are obviously all wonderful traits the Jets haven\u2019t possessed at quarterback since the last time they picked this high and selected a quarterback. That, of course, was the other \u201cBroadway,\u201d Joe Namath.Sadly, the open love fest may be short-lived because another team is now suddenly in the mix and they control the 2018 NFL Draft with the No. 1 pick.     From everything that I\u2019ve heard, this is completely and utterly shocking. That\u2019s not because I think Mayfield isn\u2019t worthy of the No. 1 pick\u2014quite the opposite. Mayfield is the most accurate quarterback in this draft and I believe he\u2019ll be a superstar at the next level, despite his stature.The reason why this would be one of the biggest shockers in NFL Draft history is based on new Cleveland Browns general manager John Dorsey\u2019s draft history.

{"content": "Plenty of new power plants are constructed every year in the United States, adding gigawatts of power generation to grids across the country, but the past few months have illustrated a dramatic shift in the type of power plant being built. A new report from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission finds that of all new electricity generation built in the first two months of 2018, a full 98 percent is renewable.According to the FERC\u2019s Energy Infrastructure Update for February, the United States added a total of 2,173 megawatts of electricity generation in January and February combined. Of that, 1,568 megawatts come from new wind farms and 565 megawatts come from new solar installations. Only 40 megawatts come from new natural gas plants, and none come from coal.This is a good sign for the environment, and it suggests that the U.S. is finally beginning to move away from fossil fuels. The numbers are likely to shift as time goes on, however. The FERC report also estimates that 69 percent of new energy generation added over the next three years will be from renewable sources.On the other side, coal power has a rough road ahead, as the FERC report predicts that 15,000 megawatts worth of coal plants will close between now and 2021. By then, new wind power additions will add nearly as much power as new natural gas plants, and it\u2019s likely within a few years nearly all new power will come from renewable sources.\n\n\n\n\n\n",  "id": "206"}

One such detail intriguing fans is where the newlyweds will live after their wedding. Here's everything we know about Nottingham Cottage, where Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will settle for their happily ever after.Nottingham Cottage is the smallest property at Kensington Palace.According to The Express, Clarence House has already confirmed that the couple will reside in Nottingham Cottage, the \"smallest abode on the estate,\" according to the The Mirror. Despite its size, the property still \"boasts reception rooms designed by Sir Christopher Wren\" and has \"a small garden, where Harry slung up a hammock when he first moved into the property.\"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle already live there.The two-bedroom property on the Kensington Palace estate is already Prince Harry's home\u2014he's lived there since 2013. According to The Express, Markle officially moved into the residence when their engagement was announced back in November 2017.Nottingham Cottage has a rich history.According to The Week, Sir Robert Fellowes, the Queen's former secretary, and his wife, Lady Jane Fellowes (who is also Princess Diana's sister) used to live there.Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge also previously lived in the apartment before upgrading to Apartment 1A, a 20-room residence inside the palace.Prince William, Kate Middleton, and Prince Harry entertain Barack and Michelle Obama in the Drawing Room of Apartment 1A at Kensington Palace.\n\n\n\nIt was originally accommodation for staff on the Kensington Palace estate.A former police protection officer told People magazine the residence is \"a lovely, classic Victorian cottage... They are well restored, typical country cottages and originally used for the estate workers. In the past 40 years or so they\u2019ve been accommodation for senior members of the household.\"The residence comes with a lot of amenities.The Mirror claims that \"Meghan can expect to be waited on hand and foot with valets, dressers, hairdressers, chefs and butlers at the ready.\"Prince Harry and his new wife might move on soon though.Both Markle and the prince have spoken about their desire to have children together, and they'll likely need a much bigger living space if they expand their family soon. The Sun is reporting that Prince Harry has already scouted out a bigger residence for them, \"possibly eyeing up the 21-room apartment\" next to Prince William's.They might take on a second residence.While Nottingham Cottage will be their home, it's thought that the couple will also have a country estate.The Week is reporting that \"When Prince William married Kate Middleton they were given Anmer Hall, a 10-bedroom Grade II-listed mansion on the Sandringham estate by the Queen, and it is believed a similar offer will be made to Prince Harry and his wife.\"While there are several contenders for the couple's second property, it was rumored back in January that Prince Harry was looking at Beaconsfield Farm, described as \"a run-down Roman villa set in the idyllic Cotswolds,\" according to BAZAAR UK. It's apparently close to Soho Farmhouse, rumored to be the site of Meghan Markle's spa-themed bridal party back in March.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",  "id": "207"}

Oh, I almost forgot to mention that I will also have music playing and/or the TV on as well.I am thoroughly immersed in noise and distraction. And most of this noise is negative and overblown. Don\u2019t believe me, watch your local news and tell me what you see.With a new year right around the corner, what if you went on an information fast? Try unplugging from most of the \u201cnoise\u201d sources and spend more time with family, friends, or outside. What I am proposing is an information diet.This starts with employing some selective ignorance.When you take more charge of your personal life and your family life, you don\u2019t need to know as much about what others are doing. You can become more concerned about what you are doing. This produces action.Many times my wife and I have had the discussion about not enjoying a particular season or phase of life. What breaks us free from this gloominess is action. Creating an intentional life and relationship requires massive action.If you are interested in producing more action as you design your relationship and unplug from the cyber-connected information world, here are a few suggestions:Take an inventory of the information and noise sources you consume each day. Rate them each as necessary, irrelevant to your goals, negative, or beyond your concern. Be honest. I will bet that much of the information you consume is in the latter three categories.The next step is to unplug from all but the necessary. Focus on consuming only the information important for you and your family\u2019s goals each day.Then pull the plug on these sources everyday at a set time, say 7 PM, in order to spend time with your spouse and family. This includes business and personal emails, phone calls, time wasting TV shows, etc. Let voicemail do its job. Save your correspondence until the next day, then take a focused hour and get it all done.With the time you will free up by unplugging, do something together. Go to bed early, talk, play legos with your kids. Trust me, the information you may miss when you unplug isn\u2019t that important anyway. If there is something that is truly an emergency, you\u2019ll hear about it. But the time you spend with your family and marriage is worth it. It will produce more action, which will generate more energy, which will allow more freedom to design the relationship and family you desire.When it comes to information, less truly is more.

This treatment is used for many conditions and diseases, but also it has been used to calm down crying babies.Babies can\u2019t tell you what is wrong and which is the reason for their crying, but reflexology can help you to find out what is the problem, thus helping you to solve it faster.Reflexology foot guide for babiesIt is considered that babies are more responsive to the practice in comparison with adults, because babies are more receptive to touch. Usually, when the babies are upset, we use to hold them or rub their back, which makes reflexology an ideal technique for them.This technique works by applying pressure on specific points on the body, and treating numerous problems linked to different parts of the body. The above guide shows these body parts and their relation to the areas of the babies\u2019 feet.Head\\\\TeethYou need to work on the tips of the toes in order to treat problems related to the head and teeth. This will reduce the pain which is caused by teething or ear infections.SinusesThe center of the toes is the area on the feet that affects sinuses. Massaging these areas can relieve the sinus problems as a runny nose. Even though it will not entirely cure the colds, it will reduce the symptoms and you baby will be calmed down.ChestThe top of the foot above the arch is connected to the chest area. Applying pressure on this area will relieve chest congestion. Moreover, it is extremely effective for treating colds or chronic coughs that cause phlegm buildup. Many studies claim that reflexology can reduce all forms of congestion.Upper and lower abdomenUpper abdomen is connected to the arch of the foot. Applying pressure on this area will help with digestive issues as bowel obstruction or heartburn.The lower half of the arch is connected with the lower abdomen. Massage this point in order to treat post-digestive problems as bloating and constipation.Solar plexusSolar plexus is a collection of nerves between the lungs and stomach. It is difficult to determine the cause of pain in this area because of the different nerve endings, but it is recommended to massage the upper area of the foot arch.PelvisThe heel of the baby\u2019s foot is connected to pelvic pain. Massaging this area will help you to relieve postural problems and muscle tightness.It is very important to know that reflexology can help you only with certain types of pain.

After a tense 2017 filled with ballistic missile launches and North Korea\u2019s sixth nuclear test, both sides have made huge strides toward diplomacy in 2018, leading up to Friday's summit, just the third time leaders of the two Koreas have met.When Kim then stepped across the border to the South, he became the first North Korean leader to set foot on South Korean soil since the Korean War ceased in 1953. Both sides are still technically at war, as an armistice was signed that stopped the fighting but not a peace treaty.During their greeting at the border, Kim appeared to go off-script and invited Moon to first briefly cross into North Korean territory, which the South Korean president accepted with a broad smile.After their greeting, the leaders walked down a red carpet together, escorted by an honor guard in traditional Korean attire. Moon and Kim were greeted by two children, who offered flowers to Kim. The children are students at an elementary school in Taesung Village, the only inhabited town within the demilitarized zone (DZ).The leaders made their way to a reviewing stand to inspect a South Korean military honor guard, a diplomatic protocol often used on state visits. Moon later introduced his delegates for the summit to Kim, who then introduced his team of eight delegates to Moon, including his sister, Kim Yo-jong, Kim Yong-nam, the North\u2019s nominal head of state, and Kim Yong-chol, previously the head of the North\u2019s military intelligence agency.In another apparently impromptu moment, Kim suggested the teams gather for a group photo. Afterwards, the leaders made their way to the Peace House, the building on the South side of Panmunjom border village, where the talks will be held.Inside the venue, Kim signed a guestbook with a message: \"New history starts from now, at the historic starting point of an era of peace.\"  The two leaders made some opening remarks before the two sides began closed-door talks in the first round of their discussion. Kim noted that it had been 11 years since the last summit, and said: \u201cWalking here, I wondered why it took so long.\u201d The North Korean leader added that he wanted to hold \u201cfrank and sincere\u201d discussions with Moon and hoped for a \u201cgood outcome.\u201d\u201cPanmunjom has become a symbol of peace instead of a symbol of division,\" the moment Kim crossed the border, Moon said. He thanked the North Korean leader for his \u201ccourage\u201d in agreeing to the summit, saying: \u201cYou have made today\u2019s moment possible.\u201d The agenda for the summit consists of three topics: denuclearization, establishing permanent peace on the Korean Peninsula and improving inter-Korean relations. It is that first agenda item, denuclearization, that is casting the biggest remaining question mark over the carefully choreographed event. It is unclear how exactly each side defines denuclearization and it remains to be seen what sort of agreement and roadmap will emerge out of the talks.North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile tests last year likely put it on the threshold of becoming a legitimate nuclear power. North Korea claims it has already risen to that level.Kim\u2019s news agency said that the leader would \u201copen-heartedly\u201d discuss with Moon \u201call the issues arising in improving inter-Korean relations and achieving peace, prosperity and reunification of the Korean Peninsula\u201d in a \u201chistoric\u201d summit.The greeting of the two leaders was planned to the last detail. Thousands of journalists were kept in a huge conference center well away from the summit, except for a small group of tightly controlled pool reporters at the border.Following the first session of talks, Kim will cross back to the North for a brief recess and lunch before returning for more ceremonial events, further talks and a formal dinner.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b",  "id": "221"}

The included charging case can juice up the glasses four times before it needs recharging on its own.\nI struggle to see why Snap is still keen on these. The company racked up some $40 million in losses with the first version of Spectacles, and this iteration doesn\u2019t overcome the major hurdles in garnering widespread appeal: they\u2019re like a GoPro for your face that people around you might find creepy, and not everyone needs a front-facing hands-free camera.\nThat\u2019s not to say that Snap shouldn\u2019t continue to make hardware. It\u2019s in the business of creating and aiding in fun new ways for people to interact and share moments online, and that means trying out ideas that may seem absurd at first.\nBut these Spectacles don\u2019t seem like the way forward.

{"content": "Emperor penguins are excellent divers, and scientists in Antarctica have clocked the world's longest dive from the aquatic bird.\nThe tracked penguins managed to complete underwater dives as long as 32.2 minutes, eclipsing the previous record of 27.6 minutes. On average, emperor penguins dive for about three to six minutes.\n\nOn average, the penguins dove 90.2 metres (98.64 yards) deep, but sometimes went as deep as 450 metres (492 yards). More than 96,000 dives were recorded, with most tags attached for at least six months.\nThe research was compiled by Kim Goetz, a marine ecologist at New Zealand's National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research, and published in a paper.\nGoetz tagged 20 penguins at Antarctica's Cape Colbeck in 2013 to conduct her findings, but it nearly didn't go to plan because of her team's late arrival.\n\"Our original goal was to tag breeding penguins at Cape Colbeck after their annual moult at the end of January. But because the voyage was delayed we didn\u2019t get there until early March,\" she said in a statement.\n\"We didn't expect penguins to still be there and thought we would have to locate them on the pack ice which was going to be more difficult.\"\n\nFortunately, there managed to be a handful of adult penguins still hanging around at Cape Colbeck which were quickly tagged. The problem though, was these animals weren't breeding penguins as anticipated.\n\"If they were breeders, their tracks would have been a lot shorter and they would have returned to the breeding ground by early June but they didn\u2019t. They kept foraging because they had no reason to go back,\" she said.\nBut that allowed Goetz and her team to survey the behaviour of adult emperor penguins after they leave breeding colonies, something which is little known about. \nIt allowed the team to discover just how far these penguins go, heading into deeper waters to catch fish. Researchers thought they survived on krill, which lurks in shallower waters.\nGoetz said the findings helped researchers understand how emperor penguins survive in the most extreme environmental conditions, which happens after they leave their breeding colonies in mid-December to mid-January.\n\"That\u2019s why understanding their entire life cycle, especially when birds are not restrained by chick-rearing duties, is critical to predicting how emperor penguins might respond to environmental changes,\" she said.\n",  "id": "230"}

The fibromas aren\u2019t rare because everyone has at least one fibroma.This tumors cause serious problems when they appear on the places where the skin rubs, which is pretty painful. It could even inflame, grow and cause bleeding.Main reason for their occurrence is not clear, but obesity and heredity are one of the reasons. You can eliminate them without bleeding and scarring with the help of apple acid.The apple acid is considered as the most effective ingredient for this problem. It is also good in treating other health issues.It is important that you must not use apple acid for eliminating fibroma on the eyelid.Following method is effective for most of the people.First thing to do is to clean the area around fibrma with water and soap. Soak the fibroma into water for 15 minutes. Then you should dry it and then dip a cotton swab in malic acid and drain the excess. Put it directly on the fibroma and put a flaster over it in order to fix it. Leave it to work for 15 minutes and then wash away with water.Iterate the same method three times daily for few days to one week. The fibromas will first become darker and then catch crust until they are dried completely and removed.Apply grease calendula or Aloe Vera gel, depending on the size of the fibroma or how deep it is in the skin because it can cause some damage.If it is not visible any scar and it isn\u2019t deep in the skin then this method is done carefully.",  "id": "232"}

{"content": "Home \u00bb Hearing Health \u00bb The Surprising Factor That Can Cause Hearing Loss (It\u2019s Not Noise!)\n\n\n\nHow are your stress levels? Are you at the point of pulling out your hair, or would you say you have it under control? It\u2019s important to properly control your stress levels as it can take a very negative toll on your overall health. More specifically, it has been discovered that stress can contribute to hearing loss.We all have some level of stress in our lives, but prolonged, chronic stress is the dangerous type. Stress has been found to suppress the immune system, impair digestion, interrupt sleep, and even impact our reproductive system. Chronic stress can also lead to hypertension, diabetes, and other illnesses.\nStress limits blood circulation and in order to hear or perform any bodily function, you need an adequate supply of blood circulation. When the tiny sensory hairs in the ears don\u2019t receive adequate blood circulation \u2014 which can also be impacted by hypertension, diabetes, and smoking \u2014 then they can\u2019t work properly and contribute to poor hearing. This causes the sensory hairs to become damaged or die, which ultimately leads to permanent hearing loss.\n\nPoor circulation can also lead to tinnitus, or ringing in the ears, and this can occur due to high blood pressure resulting from stress.\nThe takeaway here is to better manage your stress, which can easily be done through natural methods including exercising, meditation, yoga, laughing at a joke or funny video, or talking to your friend or family for support. Whatever you do to combat stress, make sure that it\u2019s a positive habit rather than a destructive one like smoking or drinking.\n",  "id": "242"}

But the good lord surrounded me with great men, Mr.Chip was one of them.\u201d\u201cHe constantly preached the value of an education, taught me how to take care of a yard, he taught me to see people for who they are not what they look like, he taught me how to treat my mother like a saint and many other life lessons,\u201d added Shugart. \u201cHis contributions to me becoming a good son, man, and father were huge. I am forever grateful for God putting him in my life.\u201d\u201cSo this past May, my wife and I had a little boy named Bob Wayne Shugart,\u201d explained Cody Shugart. \u201cWhen Mr. Chip and his wife Shirley saw him, they fell in love with him. They babysit him sometimes, and we go and visit when we can. The last time we were over there, Mr. Chip said he wants to be called \u2018POP.\u2019 He says that\u2019s his grandson.

Plus, given that it is one of Prince George's middle names, many thought it was off the table for the new baby.

In addition to that legendary monarch, there have been several other royals named Arthur, including Henry VII's son, Arthur Tudor, Prince of Wales, and Victoria's seventh son, Prince Arthur, who was also the Duke of Connaught and Strathearn. It's also one of Prince Charles's middle names, and was one of George VI's names as well.

Due to the sensitive nature of its \u2018business,\u2019 it has deliberately shrouded its work under an inpenetrable cloak of secrecy.\nAn opportunity to meet the organization\u2019s former director, Robert Hannigan \u2014 at the IP Expo Manchester security conference \u2014 afforded me the chance to lift that shroud a little, and ask about GCHQ\u2019s internal culture.\nHannigan ran GCHQ between 2014 and 2017, and according to him, daily life there isn\u2019t too far removed from many tech startups.\nLet\u2019s talk about dress code. Given that GCHQ is a government agency, you\u2019d figure that this aspect of daily life would mirror other government departments: by that, I mean everyone would be wearing \u2018business formal.\u2019 Suits and ties. That sort of thing.\nIt turns out, that\u2019s not the case. \u201cIt certainly doesn\u2019t feel like a government department. There\u2019s a very relaxed, increasingly young culture. It\u2019s very informal,\u201d Hannigan said.\nPointing to my jeans and T-shirt, he added \u201cPeople dress like you are \u2014 you know, not in suits. They\u2019d feel very comfortable at an event like this.\u201d\nHannigan said that this young culture was \u201chelped\u201d by the architecture of its Cheltenham headquarters. GCHQ occupies a doughnut-shaped building on the outskirts of the city, which bears more than a passing resemblance to Apple\u2019s newest headquarters, even though it was built nearly fifteen years previously.\nInside, this bears some resemblance to some of Silicon Valley\u2019s glimmering office buildings. \u201cEverything\u2019s open plan,\u201d Hannigan said. \u201cIt\u2019s got an open courtyard in the middle where people can get coffee. It feels more like a tech company than anything.\u201d\n\u201cYoung people walk in, and aside from the fact that they\u2019ve got to leave their phones at the door, they like the fact that there\u2019s coffee places \u2014 there\u2019s a Starbucks and a Costa. They like the openness of it. Even though it\u2019s a bit overcrowded \u2014 and that\u2019s why we\u2019re opening a new office in Manchester \u2014 it\u2019s a nice working environment.\u201d\nThis young vibe is weirdly reflected in the newspaper choices of those that work there. According to Hannigan, The Guardian is the most popular daily amongst GCHQ\u2019s workers.\nThat\u2019s a little surprising when you consider that The Guardian was the newspaper that introduced Edward Snowden to the world, and is the most easily the most liberal-leaning paper of the newsstands.\nGCHQ is an organization that\u2019s desperately thirsty for talent, and is expanding massively. Its Manchester office, which is scheduled to open next year, is expected to add \u201chundreds of new jobs\u201d to the area.\nGiven that it\u2019ll have to compete with the Manchester\u2019s tech firms \u2014 many of which have aped Silicon Valley\u2019s working culture as a recruitment strategy \u2014 it makes sense that it\u2019ll follow suit.",  "id": "250"}

When China will invite Alibaba, Baidu and other major mainland technology companies already listed in the US to issue China depository receipts in China, there is no need for them to list in Hong Kong,\u201d Leung said during a forum of the chamber.\n\u201cThis will led to more new economy companies that have not yet listed to opt for listing in the US instead of Hong Kong, as they will think they can issue China depository receipts at a later stage.\u201d\nLeung is known as the \u201cfather of red chips\u201d. As a well-known investment banker in the 1990s, he brought many red chips \u2013 companies with a mainland parent incorporated overseas \u2013 to list in Hong Kong.\n\u201cThose listed in the US already have exposure to international investors. The reason for them to have a secondary listing in Hong Kong is to capture mainland investors who trade these stocks via the stock connects. If China were to invite these companies to issue China depository receipts on the mainland, there is no point in them having a secondary listing here,\u201d said Leung.\n\u201cHowever, the China depository receipt requirements are very high, and only the very large companies will be invited by authorities to issue these in China. As such, companies that do not qualify will still like to list in Hong Kong after the listing reform,\u201d he said.\n\nLeung added that mainland companies too wanted to list in Hong Kong, because they wanted to capture international investors.\nHe said that faced with such competition, the Hong Kong stock exchange would need to be more proactive in its fight for such companies to list.\nHong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, the local bourse operator, announced its biggest reform in 25 years on Tuesday. It will from Monday allow dual-class shareholding technology companies and biotechnology companies with no revenue to apply for listings here. Dual-class shareholding companies allow founders, or key management of the companies, to hold a premium class of shares that has higher voting rights than normal shareholders, a structure favoured by many technology companies.\nBut Leung said the reform had not gone far enough. He said it was not right for the HKEX to require that premium class shareholders have the same voting rights as ordinary shareholders when they elect independent non-executive directors, or change articles of association.\nWhen China will invite Alibaba, Baidu and other major mainland technology companies already listed in the US to issue China depository receipts in China, there is no need for them to list in Hong Kong\nFrancis Leung Pak-to, chairman of the Chamber of Hong Kong Listed Companies\n\u201cThe whole idea of allowing dual-class shareholding structure companies to list here is to allow the founders and key management to keep control over major issues even though they hold minority stakes. Waiving their special rights to appoint independent directors to the board will not reduce their influence on the board,\u201d he said.\nThe HKEX introduced this requirement to meet a demand by fund managers for added protection for investors. Leung, however, said the bourse operator should achieve balance to make sure founders and management have control.\nHe also said the HKEX should expand the reform to allow companies, instead of just individuals, to hold these premium class shares.\n\nPaul Chan Mo-po, the Financial Secretary of Hong Kong, who was present at the forum, said: \u201cThe government supports the listing reform allowing dual-class shareholding companies to list here, provided there are sufficient investor protection measures.

{"content": "A trip to the hair salon is related to pampering and an attractive result, whether it is a change or refreshing of hair color or a cut that will give you the \u201coomph\u201d that you need.What is the worst thing?The worst thing you have to worry about, is not being satisfied with the outcomes.In some salons, there does lie a relatively not known risk to your health.This danger was brought to light by one young woman, Elizabeth Smith, whose trip to the Blowbunny Salon in San Francisco, ended with her being rushed to the hospital.After she arrived at the hospital, she was evaluated with a CT scan.The results showed that an artery in her neck had been damaged.According to the doctors, this had caused her to have a stroke.The question is how in the world could this have happened from simply getting her hair washed at the salon sink?This situation is well-known to doctors and hair salon owners as well.This phenomenon has been called: \u201cBeauty Parlor Stroke\u201d.The salons have chairs that recline into a position that allows your neck to rest comfortably in an appropriate lip of the sink.You should listen to her story in the video below.You are going to hear about her 8 month recovery, and her desire to warn others about this relatively not known danger.It has to be noted that adjustments should be made for differences in height that could affect the angle of the neck.",  "id": "254"}
{"content": "The royal baby finally has a name! After waiting four days after the birth of their third child, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge formally announced through the Kensington Palace Twitter account on Friday, April 27 that they named their newborn prince Louis Arthur Charles.The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are delighted to announce that they have named their son Louis Arthur Charles.The baby will be known as His Royal Highness Prince Louis of Cambridge. pic.twitter.com/4DUwsLv5JQ\u2014 Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) April 27, 2018\n\n\nUp until the big announcement, the name Arthur had been the favorite choice among people placing bets in the UK to be the prince's first name. Even though the first name Louis caught many by surprise today, the prince's two middle names are traditional choices that go back generations in the royal family.The name Arthur has legendary connections to King Arthur, of course, but is also a family name for the Cambridges tied to very real people. Meaning \"bear\" in Celtic, Arthur is not only one of Prince William's middle names, but also is one of Prince Charles's too. But the name Arthur goes even farther back in the royal family. The full name of King George VI (the Queen's father) was Albert Frederick Arthur George and Queen Victoria even named her seventh child Prince Arthur, who eventually would became the Duke of Connaught and Strathearn. Prince Louis shares a middle name with both his father, Prince William, and his grandad, Prince Charles.\n\n\n\nCharles, of course, is the first name of Prince Louis's grandfather, the Prince of Wales. It also appears in beloved uncle Prince Harry's full name, Henry Charles Albert David. The moniker also happens to be one of the middle names of Queen Victoria's beloved husband, Prince Albert, whose full name was Francis Albert Augustus Charles Emmanuel. Between those two family ties and the fact that two of England's monarchs have also been named King Charles in the past, it's a classic choice for the new prince.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",  "id": "255"}

{"content": "1. The Toilet SeatMost people know the rules of the toilet seat. If you are a boy or a man and you have to use the bathroom, you put the seat up before you go to the bathroom. When you are done, you put it down. This is respectful for the women who live in the house. One rule that many people don\u2019t know is the one about closing the toilet before you flush. Many people leave the toilet lid up all the time. The ones who close the lid do so after flushing the toilet. Each of these is wrong. You are supposed to close the toilet lid before you flush the toilet. This will keep the germs in the toilet bowl from flying around the room when the toilet is flushed.2. Why We Do What We DoWhen you are little, you watch what your parents do. You learn most of the things that you know from watching and studying your parents and then mimicking their movements. If your parents perform everyday tasks the wrong way, you are going to grow up doing the same thing. In some cases, things have changed over the years and you just haven\u2019t changed with the time. This is a list of things doing wrong. You may not even realize that you are doing these things wrong.3. Holding a Steering WheelAnyone who learned to drive from when cars were invented until the 90\u2019s was taught that when you are driving, you should hold your steering wheel at positions 10 and 2. Driving schools, drivers education teachers, and even parents have taught new teen drivers that this was the safest way to hold the steering wheel while driving. Today, this is no longer the case. Now that almost every car on the road has a driver-side airbag, the rules have changed. The safest way to keep your hands on the wheel today is at positions 3 and 9 on the steering wheel. If the airbag deploys and you are at 10 and 2, your hands and arms can be seriously injured. Now that the rules have changed to 3 and 9, you won\u2019t be using any drivers education books that were printed before 2000.4. Applying DeodorantIt may sound strange but there is a good chance that you have been using deodorant wrong for your entire life. Most people get out of the shower, use their deodorant, and head to work. This is wrong. The correct way is to apply the deodorant at night before you go to sleep. At night, you sweat less. This means that your sweat glands will react better to the active ingredient because it can penetrate into the glands more effectively. This would give the deodorant a chance to work better.5. Organizing Your DrawersSince you were a small child, your parents have been telling how to fold your clothes and put them in your drawers. What you may not know is that this is not the best way to do it. If you roll your clothes up and put them in your drawers, they won\u2019t get wrinkled and it will save a lot of space. Also, if you are looking for a certain item of clothing, you won\u2019t need to dig through a pile of folded clothes in the drawer. Everything will be in plain sight.6. Cleaning Your BlenderIf you have ever cleaned a blender, you know that you need to be really careful. If you aren\u2019t you could cut your hands on the blades at the bottom. If you have been cleaning your blender by hand, you are doing it all wrong. The best way to clean the blender is to fill it halfway with water, add a bit of dish soap, and turn on the blender. When you are done, rinse it thoroughly and you are ready to blend again.7. SleepingSince the day you were born you have been sleeping. If you have been sleeping on your stomach all your life, you are sleeping the wrong way. When you sleep on your stomach, it puts added strain on your back and your spine. This can cause your back to feel sore during the day. If you want to wake up feeling great with no pain, you should start sleeping on your side. You may roll over to your stomach in the middle of the night, however, if you start on your side, you will notice the difference when you wake up in the morning.8. TypingWhen you first start learning to type, you are supposed to extend the stands at the bottom of the keyboard. This is so that you can see the letters. When you can type without looking, you should close the legs on the keyboard. If you leave them up, it can make your wrists ache.9. Tying Your ShoesWhen you first learn to tie your shoes, you are taught the bunny ears method. This is where you make a bunny ear with each lace and then tie them in a knot. When you start getting better, you are told to make just one loop and wrap the other lace around it and go into the hole This is a mistake. You should stick with the bunny ears method if you want to keep your shoes from coming untied.",  "id": "257"}

{"content": "Nothing in your body lasts forever. Every single cell in your body will die eventually, and eventually you\u2019ll run out of replacements. When that happens, various parts of your body will stop working correctly, and at some point the whole thing will shut down. Aging happens to all of us, and there\u2019s nothing we can do about it.Except, maybe there is. Researchers from UC Berkeley have discovered the 3D structure of the enzyme telomerase, which could lead to new advances in aging research, as well as possible new insights into cancer.The newly visualized enzyme telomerase, which works in our cells to extend the length of our telomeres.\n\n\n\nNguyen et al.\n\nThe reason we age\u2014or at least, one of the reasons\u2014is because our cells can only multiply a certain number of times. Each time our cells split, a tiny part of the ends of our chromosomes doesn't make the cut. Over successive cell divisions, our DNA gets shorter and shorter. The only thing protecting our genes are the endcaps, called telomeres.Telomeres don\u2019t code for any genes, but they protect the more useful bits of our DNA from getting damaged during replication. The problem is that when our telomeres run out, our cells can\u2019t replicate any more. But some of our cells\u2014typically stem cells and cancer cells\u2014don\u2019t have this concern, because they have an enzyme called telomerase that keeps making the telomeres longer.Telomerase was discovered in 1997, but it\u2019s so complicated that researchers have been unable to determine what it looked like until now. The researchers used a new imaging technique called cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), which involves cryogenically freezing a sample before looking at it with an electron microscope. This technique can illuminate structures too sensitive for normal electron microscopes.Now that we know the structure of telomerase, we can start creating drugs and therapies to target it. We might be able to artificially extend the lifespan of our cells\u2014and by extension, ourselves\u2014or stop the runaway replication behind cancers. It\u2019s still a long way to go before we start seeing those things, but this is an important and crucial first step.Source: UC Berkeley\n\n\n\n\n\n",  "id": "259"}

This conditioner is extremely rich in iron, Vitamin A and all major vitamin. The minerals from beetroot, also gives a beautiful maroon tinge and tea intensifies the color of hair and conditions it. Rinse only with warm water, without shampoo after half an hour.    Step 3: Protein Hair MaskOne or two ripe bananas depending on the length of the hair are taken. A quarter cup of milk, 3 table-spoons of honey and egg white from 2 eggs, are added and blended to get a fine paste. Put them in a mixer grinder to get a fine paste. Banana is rich in vitamins and is a great hair softener and treats damaged hair due to environmental conditions and good for splits ends to be rectified. Milk semi straightens hair and provides protein, eggs as well have the same effect as milk while honey cleanses, deodorizes and conditions the hair.Mayonnaise can be used if you do not like the eggy smell on you. The mask is applied all over the hair and covered with a shower cap. After half an hour the hair is rinsed and shampooed to get the oil out. The banana may require extra water to get it out. The hair should be then dried in natural sun/warmth.And the final Result!Following this procedure meticulously gives amazing results. The hair gets silky-smooth and doesn\u2019t get frizzy at all for 4 days even though it is not shampooed again. The ultimate output is the rich burgundy color that shines like a mirror and the shine remains for 7 days almost.

I really went into a dark place,\" she continued.\nPaltrow has two children Apple, 13, and Moses, 12, with her ex-husband, Chris Martin. The Coldplay singer was the first to suggest that Paltrow might be experiencing symptoms of postpartum depression which include a loss in pleasure of the things that you enjoy, racing thoughts, excessive irritability, and feeling guilty or worthless, among many others. \u201cI couldn\u2019t connect with my son the way that I had with my daughter and I couldn\u2019t understand why.

According to the American Psychology Association, one in seven women experience postpartum depression. Not all women experience the same kind of postnatal depression\u2014in some cases, the symptoms are more severe, leading a woman to be hospitalized. Paltrow said this wasn't the case for her, and in 2015, she told Entertainment Weekly she wished people could not feel ashamed.\"It\u2019s a very debilitating thing, and I think there\u2019s so much shame around it and there shouldn\u2019t be,\" said Paltrow\u2014and she's right about that. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",  "id": "270"}

{"content": "Screens are all around us and are immensely useful in conveying information \u2013 but they can overwhelm us and take up more of our attention than we can afford. That\u2019s why MIT Media Lab researcher Udayan Umapathi began work on a calm interface that had a closer connection to the physical elements around us \u2013 using water.\nTogether with his colleagues \u2013 which include engineers and interaction designers \u2013 Umapathi created a project for his graduate thesis work called Programmable Droplets. The idea is to precisely control droplets of water, moving them along tracks, and merging and morphing them. Have a look in the clip below:\nThis is made possible through a technique called electrowetting, which allows for manipulating dielectric materials like water with electric fields. Umapathi explained that he first worked out the physics for programming sand particles when he took Professor Neil Gernshenfeld\u2019s class on the \u201cPhysics of Information Technology,\u201d and that their discussions led to the idea that the derivations would apply to water as well.\nHow would you use these programmable droplets? Umapathi, who describes himself as an experimental physicist, explains that there\u2019s plenty of scope for inventive art installations that take advantage of the physical properties of water (such as wetting other materials, bending light, and trapping tiny objects):\n We are working towards the goal of using our system to create kinetic installations where we can choreograph the motion of hundreds or even thousands of droplets. Imagine a thousand water droplets dancing together, wouldn\u2019t that be mesmerizing?\nI have plans for collaborating with artists and magicians in creating installations and illusions. Through these installations, we want to not only convey metaphorical meanings, but also trigger a sense of beauty and marvel in the viewer.\nWater droplets can can carry biological and chemical matter. So if you can programmatically control them, you can execute chemical and biological experiments through a piece of code, without touching any manual tools. Our work finds many applications in life sciences, particularly in biotechnology.\n\nUmapathi is also keen on creating interactive models for people to play with:\nIf you\u2019ve watched director Guillermo del Toro\u2019s recent fantasy film, The Shape of Water, you\u2019ll remember that there\u2019s a beautiful scene in which Eliza controls droplets on a window pane with her fingers. We want to develop the technology to a level where we can this can become a reality to create this kind of wonder and fantasy.\nBeyond that, he explains, the group is also developing \u201cvarious applications in biology to enable use cases which are otherwise impossible in the synthetic biology and drug discovery space.\u201d I, for one, can\u2019t wait to see water become more commonplace in modern interfaces around us.The Next Web\u2019s 2018 conference is just a few weeks away, and it\u2019ll be .

{"content": "Shadow of the Tomb Raider Will Show the Darker Side of Lara Croft Through Gameplay and Narrative\nThe year 2013 saw the Tomb Raider franchise gain the reboot and origin story it deserved. A reimagined Lara Croft was born, and her moral dilemma was established through her primal effort to survive. However, following the official reveal of Shadow of the Tomb Raider, and my hands-on time with the demo, it\u2019s clear that the newest Lara is an eclipse of the first. The curious and guileless student is gone, left stranded on the island of Yamatai; afterward, the judicious investigator left herself in a tomb in Siberia. Lara is now unhinged.\n\nCold and calculating, the young and adventurous Croft is still young but a little more brutal. This drives not only her actions but the combat of the next iteration. Square Enix and Crystal Dynamics, for the most part, rebuilt the franchise by using cinematic scaffolding and brilliant rendering. Basically, theatrical scenes and fast-paced escapes have become a part of the formula, and it would explain why Eidos Montreal hasn\u2019t switched support beams. Tomb Raider\u2019s theater is still present in the next game\u2019s narrative, something I witnessed as I waded through an intense, visceral scene of destruction in South America. So, aside from the return of key destruction and high-octane action sequences, what is the new developer bringing to the table? Swimming, for starters. Lara has been taking swimming lessons, and she utilizes her new talent to reach areas that would otherwise be inaccessible. Also, some puzzles are going to be submerged this time around. It\u2019s how the devs justify the return of a mechanic we witnessed from the original Tomb Raider games.\nWhat else can Lara Croft do? In addition to her usual dexterity, climbing now comes with the ability to rappel down terrain. Though the game has definitely broadened its scope in terms of what the player can do, Tomb Raider is more comparable to Uncharted than it ever was. Not a bad thing, considering how accessible the former feels, and that\u2019s no grief to the new Lara. There are simply more ways to get around, thanks to the addition of rope.\nA curious new instrument, however, has been added to Lara Croft\u2019s personal arsenal. Simple as it may be, it serves as a suitable reflection of her unhinged character. The instrument I speak of is a dagger. Stabby stab. Not only has the IP\u2019s stealth gameplay been improved, thanks to the inclusion of a new environmental blend mechanic, but the blade supplements the guerilla persona that has seemingly taken over our raider of tombs. Lara Croft is Rambo if Rambo held a Ph.D. in Archaeology and was far, far, far, far more beautiful. You\u2019ll even notice more definition in her physique, which is more imposing than we\u2019ve seen previously (probably from all those swimming lessons). And as one developer explained, Shadow of the Tomb Raider is the culmination of Lara Croft\u2019s origin story, where she crosses from the scholarly side of the spectrum to become a shadow warrior, to become the definitive \u201cTomb Raider.\u201d I\u2019m paraphrasing, of course. The game\u2019s Key Art is nothing less than a reflection of Lara\u2019s transcendence.\nSome other key points I learned from my time playing the Shadow of the Tomb Raider demo and from speaking to developers \u2013 Elaborating on the blending mechanic I mentioned earlier, Lara can now make herself invisible by clinging to walls of shrubbery. There will be more underground and underwater tombs, and they will be dark, which suits the game\u2019s theme of descent. Furthermore, Lara will have access to traps she can use to ensnare and dispatch enemies. On that note, according to the game\u2019s narrative director, Lara Croft will be waging a war through \u201cfear.\u201d Sounds vague, I know, but there will be new game mechanics that make for bloodier\u2014possibly more horrific\u2014outcomes than previous games.\n\n",  "id": "287"}

{"content": "If you're maintaining a low-carb diet, there is no food more magical than spaghetti squash. It\u2019s like it was invented for bikini season, because someone knew how important pasta is to us. It\u2019s super easy to make and there are so many ways to cook with it.To start, cut your squash in half lengthwise. This is definitely the hardest part of making spaghetti squash, but with a sharp chef\u2019s knife and some determination you\u2019ll do just fine. Once it\u2019s split, use a spoon to remove the seeds. (Spread those seeds out on a baking sheet and roast with some salt and chili powder for a delicious crunchy snack!) Then drizzle the cut sides with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Flip the squash cut side down on a baking sheet and pop it in a 400\u00b0F oven for 40 minutes to an hour, depending on the size of your squash.\nIf 40 minutes have passed, and you\u2019re not sure if the squash is ready, pull it out of the oven and drag the tines of a fork on the cut side. If spaghetti-like strands easily release from the skin, it\u2019s ready! If not, pop it back in the oven and check it every 5 to 10 minutes. Over-roasting can lead to soggier \u201cspaghetti\u201d so it\u2019s best to keep a close eye on the squash. When it\u2019s ready, let it cool slightly before shredding, and enjoy.

{"content": "As the Earth gets warmer, the polar ice caps melt and sea levels rise. The more sea levels rise, the more people in low-lying coastal areas are threatened. A new study funded by the U.S. military finds that more than a thousand low-lying islands and atolls across the world will be rendered uninhabitable by mid-century due to rising seas, threatening hundreds of thousands of people as well as key military assets.The U.S. military has long funded research into the impacts of climate change, primarily as it relates to strategic interests at home and abroad. For instance, earlier this year the Pentagon released a report finding that climate change threatened over half of all military bases.The more recent study examines the effect of sea level rise on island water supplies, and the researchers found that sources of drinking water on many of these islands\u2014such as groundwater or reservoirs\u2014could become contaminated with seawater if the oceans rise by as little as 15 inches.In even the best-case scenarios for sea level rise, we\u2019re likely to see that extra 15 inches well before the end of the century, and possibly as soon as next decade. The highest probability scenarios place the event sometime in the 2040s or 2050s, which is further off but still a matter of just 30 years or so. Crucially, islands like the Maldives and Marshalls will become uninhabitable even if sea levels rise according to the most optimistic roadmaps outlined in plans like the Paris Agreement, which seeks to limit warming to below 2\u2103 by reducing carbon emissions. Even if that plan is successful, many hundreds of islands will become uninhabitable, and hundreds of thousands of people will become climate refugees.The changing climate also impacts U.S. military installations based on islands in the Pacific. For instance, the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site sits on several atolls in the Marshall Islands, and it might need to be shut down or relocated in the next few decades as sea levels rise.Unlike many climate change forecasts, there may be nothing we can do to avert this. Even in the most optimistic of cases, enough warming will occur by the end of the century to trigger that 15 inches of sea level rise. The question isn\u2019t whether this will happen, but when. Hopefully we can delay the inevitable long enough to minimize the impact of displacing so many people.",  "id": "290"}

{"content": "If being married is good for health, can we say the same of cohabitation? Unfortunately, the answer seems to be no. Jamila Bookwala, a gerontologist who studies health, marriage, and aging at Lafayette University, says that there's a fundamental difference between marriage and cohabitation.\"The benefits of marriage don't seem to translate to cohabitation,\" Bookwala says. \"People who cohabitate do not enjoy the same health benefits that come with marriage. So we have to ask, what is it about the marital union that brings these benefits? The answer is still unclear.\"Part of the explanation may lie in differences in the quality of the relationships of marrieds vs. cohabiters. Relationship quality is generally higher among married people than among cohabitors, Sassler tells us -- \"and marital relationships are more enduring than cohabitations.\" Both of these factors could explain the difference between marriage and cohabitating when it comes to health and mental health benefits.Of course, marriage is not a free pass to good health. The quality of a marriage has a lot to with the health benefits the relationship may bring. For example, if a person's spouse is highly critical, that person is likely to suffer from more chronic illnesses, report more symptoms of poor health, and have more physical disabilities than those whose spouses are more positive. \"It's the negative traits in one's spouse that really affect a person's physical health,\" Bookwala says. \"On the flip-side is mental health.

{"content": "If you've ever bickered with your spouse or partner over money, you\u2019re not alone. Previous studies have shown that financial concerns are among the most common sources of disagreement for couples. And according to the 2014 APA Stress in America survey1, almost a third of adults with partners (31 percent) reported that money is a major source of conflict in their relationship.Other recent research backs those survey findings. Compared to other touchy topics, couples\u2019 arguments about money tend to be more intense, more problematic and more likely to remain unresolved.2But money doesn't have to be a wedge in your relationship. With practice, you and your partner can learn to talk about finances in a healthier, more satisfying way.Differing beliefsThe old idea that opposites attract may have some basis in reality. We are often drawn to a partner whose personality and style complements our own. But differing beliefs about money can be a recipe for conflict.We develop beliefs about money long before we comingle our finances with a romantic partner. Research shows we inherit attitudes, values and beliefs about money from our parents and other family members.3 We may not even be fully conscious of our beliefs about spending and saving.Early on in a relationship, many couples discuss their views on marriage, children and where they want to work and live. Unfortunately, couples rarely sit down together to talk about their financial beliefs and goals.But the good news: It\u2019s never too late to have that conversation. Whether you\u2019ve been in a relationship 10 weeks or 10 years, talking about your money history is a first step to getting on the same page about your finances. Some things to discuss:What did your parents teach you about money?What are your financial goals?What are your fears about money?Having an understanding of your partner\u2019s beliefs can help you avoid conflict and set the stage for healthy discussions about your joint finances.Be a teamWhen it comes to financial responsibilities, couples don\u2019t always work as a team. Only 33 percent of Stress in America survey respondents said both partners share an equal role in financial decision-making. Similarly, only 23 percent reported that management of household finances is shared equally.Couples often divide duties, and financial duties are no exception. One partner might handle day-to-day household spending, while the other focuses on long-term savings and investing. But those roles are naturally at odds with one another. Such a division of labor is often a source of conflict, experts say.To avoid the disharmony of conflicting money roles, some couples trade the jobs back and forth. One month you might handle household spending and your partner might focus on savings and investment. The next month, you can swap jobs.Another good option is to share roles equally. Set up a regular day and time each month to sit down, pay the bills, discuss your expenses and review your savings plans. Try to schedule something fun for after the meeting; if you know you\u2019ll be going to the movies or on a bike ride afterwards, your money date will feel less like a chore.As you and your partner discuss your household finances, avoid using the word \u201cbudget.\u201d Some people have negative associations with this word which may set up a feeling of deprivation. Instead, think in terms of developing a spending plan. Deciding together what goals you want to save for and what goods and services you want to spend your money on can make for a much more satisfying conversation.If your financial discussions become heated, take a time out and revisit them later. When it comes to money, you and your spouse may not always see eye to eye. But with good communication and an understanding of each other\u2019s beliefs and values, you can work together to realize your shared financial goals.Seek professional help It\u2019s not unusual for couples to find themselves having the same argument again and again, especially when it comes to spending and saving. Psychologists are experts in helping people change their behaviors and break out of unhealthy patterns. Many psychologists specialize in relationships and marital issues. They can help you and your partner learn healthy ways of communicating.

{"content": "We woke up on Friday, April 27 2018 that telecommunications giants, MTN have plans of rolling out Mobile Money ATMs. These machines, if introduced could take deposits and dispense cash for its mobile money business.\nAccording to reports, the plan is to ensure that customers find it easy to withdraw and deposit cash just like bank ATMs.\nMany agents were reported to be worried about the new development. According to them, this could put them out of business. However, an alleged response from the Bank of Ghana (BoG) suggests that people should not be worried about losing their jobs\u2013 at least, not yet.\nAccording to JoyBusiness, MTN had to suspend the move, even on a pilot basis. This is because they have not secured the necessary regulatory approvals. Sources say even though the regulator is willing to approve the service, it wants to be carried out in a way that would not result in MTN operating as a fully fledged bank.\n\n\n\nAside that, the regulators are concerned about the number of people who will lose their jobs because of the development as Mobile Money employs more than 150,000 persons at the moment.\nLastly, the Payment and Settlement bill, which will seek to address issues like this, is yet to receive parliamentary approval. Therefore, it is likely that it might take a while before MTN can introduce the full service to aid its mobile money business.\nSo if you are concerned about the introduction of MTN mobile money ATMs, don\u2019t worry yet.

Despite what we might see in TV shows like 24 or movies like Contagion, we don\u2019t have teams of experts ready to spring into action at the first signs of a global outbreak.\nBut we should, philanthropist Bill Gates emphasized during his Shattuck Lecture for the Massachusetts Medical Society today. And Gates is ready to put up $12 million to help us get there.\nEach year, the Massachusetts Medical Society and the New England Journal of Medicine present an event featuring panelists and speakers focused on a specific health-related topic. This year, that topic was epidemics. What better speaker than Bill Gates, whose foundation strives to combat some of the biggest threats to public health, such as HIV and malaria? During his presentation, Gates looked to the past, present, and future of our outbreak preparedness.\nThe short version: We\u2019ve come a long way, but still have a long way to go.\nBack in 1889, the Russian flu became the first flu pandemic to spread across continents. A few decades later, the 1918 flu pandemic killed 675,000 people in just five weeks.\nLuckily for those of us alive now, today we have vaccines, drugs, and diagnostic tools that help us address outbreaks far more effectively than when those illnesses first took hold.\nBut we still fall short in so many respect, according to Gates.\nHe noted the \u201cwake up calls\u201d of the 2009 H1N1 virus and West Africa\u2019s more recent Ebola outbreak. The world didn\u2019t respond quickly enough in either situation. We couldn\u2019t effectively track the diseases as they spread. Our local health systems simply collapsed. People kept dying because we weren\u2019t ready.\n\u201cThe world needs to prepare for pandemics in the same serious way it prepares for war,\u201d Gates told the audience.\nOne way to be better prepared for the inevitable next pandemic: to develop better weapons to fight outbreaks. To that end, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation has teamed up with the family of Google co-founder and Alphabet CEO Larry Page to launch the Universal Influenza Vaccine Development Grand Challenge.\nAccording to the challenge website, the goal is to find a \u201cgame changing, universal solution\u201d to address both pandemic and seasonal influenza. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates 290,000 to 650,000 people die from the latter each year, and while less common, pandemic influenza can be even more deadly.\nThe Grand Challenge will award $150,000 to $2 million in funding over two years to the most promising proposals for a universal flu vaccine. Then, those projects that \u201cdemonstrate promising proof-of-concept data,\u201d such as success in animal models, can apply for a full award of $10 million for additional studies.\nThe Gates Foundation is thinking big and fast with this challenge. They\u2019re only interested in a universal flu vaccine \u2014 not one that might work to address certain strains of the flu or in certain populations \u2014 and they want it to be ready for clinical trials by 2021.\nWe may not meet the Hollywood standard for outbreak preparedness today, but if Bill Gates has anything to say about it, we might in the very near future.\n\n\n",  "id": "301"}

French First Lady Brigitte Macron learned that much when she met Melania Trump during their recent state visit to Washington.She told Le Monde, as translated by The Guardian, that she learned that Melania\u2019s life is very restricted, and that may explain why she comes across as emotionless in public. The first lady \u201ccannot do anything,\u201d Macron said, likely noting security concerns. \u201cShe can\u2019t even open a window at the White House. She can\u2019t go outside. She\u2019s much more constrained than I am. I go out every day in Paris.\u201d  Macron also added that Melania often has to restrict what she says and how she appears because of the close scrutiny of the media, but in private is \u201ckind, charming, intelligent, and very open,\u201d and \u201cactually really fun,\u201d sharing the same sense of humor. (And they probably got along swimmingly, especially since Melania speaks fluent French.)\u201cEverything is interpreted, over-interpreted. She\u2019s someone who has a strong personality, but works hard to hide it,\u201d she said. \u201cShe laughs very easily, at everything, but shows it less than I do.\u201d But Melania\u2019s French counterpart can empathize with the media twisting her words. \u201c[I have to] be careful what I say. I have the impression that every word is a word too many, I\u2019m constantly holding myself back,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the hardest part: there\u2019s never really any time off, never a moment when you can be completely calm.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n",  "id": "306"}

{"content": "With April coming to a close, there's a fresh group of augmented reality Snapchat lenses you should try out while they're still hot. We've got a prank lens, gamer-oriented ones for Fortnite and Fallout, and ones for the memesters out there.If you're new to the user-generated Snapchat lens game, it's super easy. Just tap a link or scan a Snapcode to use one. If you have a preference regarding the method, I've included both options here in April 27's selection so you can get these lenses however you please. And if you're a fan of them, don't forget to send the lenses to your friends so they can enjoy them as well.While all of these lenses are labeled as such because they were created in Snapchat's Lens Studio, some are more like filters where the image is a static overlay versus an AR three-dimensional object. I'll specify which those are in the descriptions, but it doesn't make them any better or worse inherently.\n\n1: Fortnite DanceAfter breaking out a PUBG lens last week, it's only fair that I extend the same treatment to Fortnite. This lens by mrtolien features a high-res animation of a character dancing along with with the \"Victory Royale\" banner that accompanies a win.Unlock the Fortnite Dance lens on Snapchat right now 2: GotchaAround 10 or so years ago, people would \"get\" their friends by having them look at their hand making an \"OK\" symbol. If they got you, you'd be punched in the arm. It was really stupid. So now, people have begun to make fun of this practice in a series of memes. I've seen low-effort lenses floating around that are capitalizing on this trend, but this one by Adam Bird is honestly genius. The idea of putting it inside a brightly-colored hole was a great idea.Unlock the Gotcha lens on Snapchat right now  \n\n3: Seinfeld CreditsIn a similar vein to the Curb Your Enthusiasm theme (lens available), the Seinfeld credits have become a solid capstone to a meme, giving situations a sitcom-y feel to them. This filtery-lens will actually go through the entire credits if you give it enough time, so it's cool that Alex Bardell put the time in for that.Unlock the Seinfeld Credits lens on Snapchat right now 4: ApyrApyr (translates to \"friend\" in Russian) is a meme that is an amalgam of a photo manipulation from Fallout 4 and a post from /r/4PanelCringe. The combination yielded an interesting image, which was extrapolated into a YouTube video.

Red glowing eyes were also integrated into the deep fried template, leading to this Lens by Young DimmaDome. Point it at your face and your eyes will glow red, but the grainy filter is applied everywhere.Unlock the Deep Fried lens on Snapchat right now These are the best lenses I could find for the week.

Despite all of the speculation, Treyarch has not addressed any of the rumors to be true. What they may have just done however, is teased the return of the pick 10 class system for Black Ops 4!\nThat\u2019s right, the pick 10 system may be coming back. Following a tweet from a fan that says, \u201cIn Treyarch we trust,\u201d the company tweeted back along with a cryptic picture. Treyarch wrote, \u201cWe give this post a 10/10. Can\u2019t wait to talk about #BlackOps4 on May 17!\u201d While the words could be taken at face value it\u2019s the picture of ten small yellow boxes followed by 10/10 that really seem to hint at this class system return. Well, that and the obvious connection between the picture and the big upcoming reveal date. You can check out the tweet below.\n \n\nThe Pick 10 system, which first showed up in Treyarch\u2019s Black Ops II, provides players with ten points to allocate in whichever way they see fit. The system allows players quite a bit of control as they get to choose between various loadout element. Taking an extra weapon attachment, an extra grenade, or even an extra perk all cost points. Once you\u2019ve reached ten, you are no longer able to add anything else to the loadout unless you replace another element. Despite it\u2019s popularity, it was dropped from the most recent Call of Duty game: WWII.\nDo you think Treyarch is hinting at the return of the pick 10 system to Black Ops 4? If so, are you excited about its return or is there a different class system you prefer?

{"content": "You know your home is cool when it not only has its own estately title, but that title has a nickname. Such is the life of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, who call Nottingham Cottage \u2014 or \"Nott Cott\" \u2014 home. The couple lives in the two-bedroom house, right within the grounds of Kensington Palace, leading some to wonder, will they move to grander digs once they're officially married on May 19?It's a valid question, though for now, Nott Cott is and will be their home. Moving in before the big day lets them get settled into the space, making it their own before Markle's walk down the aisle. If the cottage sounds familiar, that's because the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge lived there for about two and a half years, The Telegraph reported. The ceilings are so low, it's reported that Prince William had to stoop at times to avoid hitting his head. At 6-foot-1, Harry's two inches shorter than his older brother, but he still might have to watch out. Beyond that, not much is known about what the interior of the cottage looks like. It was designed by the same architect who created St. Paul's Cathedral, Sir Christopher Wren, and it's rumored that it doesn't have air conditioning (which would make sense, given its age), so anyone who lives there has to set up fans to stay cool in the summer.These descriptors \u2014 head-smackable ceilings, a lack of air conditioning \u2014 may not make it sound like a place fit for royalty, but the cottage has a certain bucolic charm to it. Former Nott Cott resident Marion Crawford wrote that it \"looks as if it had got to London quite by mistake from some distant country place,\" in her 1950 memoir, The Little Princesses: The Story of the Queen\u2019s Childhood by Her Nanny, Marion Crawford. \nIt has its own garden, where Prince Harry reportedly strung up a hammock shortly after moving in, lending to that feeling of being away-from-it-all even when you're in the midst of bustling London \u2014 and not too far from the ever-present hum of paparazzi and tourists.

It seems like plans for the virtual tour inspired them to record a couple of new tracks on top of it.\nThe future of live concerts promises to be vastly different than what we\u2019re used to.

So what\u2019s stopping them from showing up on stage, themselves?\nIt\u2019s pretty much because they don\u2019t want to. Since it broke up in 1982, the band has refused many requests to reunite on stage IRL.\nThe December broadcast is being put together by Simon Fuller, the guy you have to thank for American Idol and So You Think You Can Dance. According to a 2016 post on ABBA\u2019s Facebook page, the event will feature \u201cthe very latest in digital and virtual reality technology.\u201d Except that that was two years ago, and no further details have emerged, except for this announcement of new material.\nBut let\u2019s have ABBA Take A Chance on this new venture.

But there's still that nagging feeling, that itch in the back of your mind, insisting quietly yet forcefully that you haven't escaped Mark Zuckerberg's data-slurping maw just yet. \nThat would be Instagram. To be truly (well, sort of) free, you know deep down that you must delete Instagram, too. Thankfully, the company was just compelled (hat tip, GDPR) to release a new feature which enables you to download a bunch of your data \u2014 making sure you don't have to leave empty handed when you walk out that social-media door.\n\nThe feature was released earlier this week, and is relatively straightforward to enact. That doesn't mean it's transparent, however. To download your data, you must first request a download link. You do that by heading on over to the Instagram data-download page on your web browser, logging into your account, and requesting a link be emailed to you. \n\"Get a Copy of What You've Shared on Instagram,\" reads the page. \"We'll email you a link to a file with your photos, comments, profile information and more. We can only work on one request from your account at a time, and it may take up to 48 hours to collect this data and send it to you.\"\nNow, there is one key part of that statement which needs parsing. Mainly, Instagram says it's only going to give you a copy of what you've shared. In other words, not the complete horde of data the company has collected on you \u2014 just what you've intentionally shared with the site. \nThere's also the question of what exactly \"and more\" means. This reporter downloaded an Instagram account's data and found that it included everything from a list of all the posts you've liked, to long-deleted photos, to random account settings, to a list of who you're following and your followers. \nImage: mashableIt does not include, for example, a record of all the devices you've used to access your account, the times you've accessed your account, or other metadata that Instagram is likely collecting. \nFacebook, too, doesn't truly give you all of the data it has on you when you download your account information. It gives you a lot, but as Wired reported, there's plenty that's not included in Facebook's \"download your data.\"\nNone of that should stop you from deleting your account, however. \nWhen that download-your-data link does come through, download it then delete your account.

He\u2019s taken the Toronto Maple Leafs from one of the game\u2019s worst teams into the playoffs in relatively short time.Lamoriello\u2019s son, Chris, is currently the Islanders assistant general manager, something that wasn\u2019t lost on Friedman or The Athletic\u2019s Arthur Staple.While it\u2019s a situation most definitely worth watching, the Islanders don\u2019t seem to be in any rush to replace Snow, as Sportsnet\u2019s John Shannon reports.Snow, contrary to what he and the franchise would like you to believe, has been a colossal failure over his 12-year run as Islanders general manager. The team has made just four playoff appearances during his reign.While Lamoriello\u2019s lengthy track record of success would be a welcome change, there\u2019s no reason to believe the Islanders will actually try and bring him aboard at this point.

{"content": "The stars are out in full force in Los Angeles for the New York Yankees. No, not Aaron Judge and Giancarlo Stanton. How about a former Yankee All-Star?Riding a six-game winning streak, the New York Yankees are red-hot and ready to face the 16-9 Los Angeles Angels on the West Coast. It seems the Yankees have a little luck on their side, as Alex Rodriguez visited the YES Network booth prior to first pitch.Look at the smiles on this crew! Plus the incredible photobomb by Ken Singleton because he just wants to be a part of the action. After all, it IS his final season in the booth.     And it looks like the retired life is treating A-Rod pretty well. He looks absolutely fabulous and at home (of course) in the booth. But these guys likely aren\u2019t the only stars in the stadium this evening.Of course, the California native in Aaron Judge is likely drawing in big crowds. Fans wanting to see Stanton and the recently hot Gary Sanchez in action are flooding the ballpark. And we can\u2019t forget about the star-studded power with their opponents.Shohei Ohtani is making his first career appearance against the Yankees after he turned down the option to come to New York City. Perennial MVP candidate Mike Trout puts on a show every night, something the Yankees have yet to see firsthand this season.A-Rod himself had some pretty great success against the Angels. In 207 career games against them, he batted an impressive .319 while hitting 70 home runs, the most he\u2019s hit against any opponent in his career.In Angel Stadium alone, A-Rod hit 38 home runs while boasting a .663 slugging percentage.So, yeah, I think the Yankees could use a little bit of luck against the AL West opponents. Hopefully A-Rod\u2019s Angel dominance can rub off on this young band of Yankees this weekend.

Saturday, the rebuilding process continues as the NHL Draft Lottery to determine who will get the number pick in NHL draft in June will be held.The lottery was created to prevent teams from tanking late in a losing season and getting the number one pick in the draft.The Rangers traded away some of their top players (Michael Grabner, Rick Nash, Ryan McDonagh and J.T. Miller) late in the season for high draft picks with the hope of improving their team.     The lottery will have a big impact on what the direction the franchise takes in rebuilding.

They will take their spot in the draft as they are eliminated from the playoffs, hence the New Jersey Devils are not included in the above list.The presumptive first pick in this years draft is Rasmus Dahlin. The 18-year-old defenseman is currently playing for Frolunda HC in the Swedish Elite League. He\u2019s a smart two-way player with great stick-handling skills who can play in any situation.The odds of the Rangers getting the first pick overall are low, but their chances for a top three pick improves to 19 percent. They have 10 picks overall heading into this year\u2019s draft.General Manager Jeff Gorton will have to make sure none of the picks are wasted opportunities in the effort to improve on what was a poor season.The Rangers missed the playoffs for the first time in eight seasons and vowed to improve in the offseason as they attempt to get back into the playoffs as early as next season.

{"content": "1. Cinemas Make More Money From the ConcessionsMost people think that cinemas make most of their money on the overpriced tickets that they sell. This is not true. Most cinemas actually make the bulk of their money off the overpriced snacks that they sell at the concession stand. This is why they don\u2019t allow you to bring outside food into the cinema. If they did, you would be seriously lowering their profits.2. You Will Be Arrested For Recording a MovieThere are plenty of people out there who buy a ticket to a movie and they hide their video camera in their coat. They do this so that they can record the movie and then sell bootleg copies or they post them online. If you think sounds like a good idea, you should know that if you get caught recording a movie, the cinema employees will call the police and you will be arrested. If you catch someone recording a movie and you have no problem ratting them out, you can leave the cinema $500 richer.3. The Sound Levels in the cinema Can Be DangerousIf you have ever been to the movies, especially an action movie, you know how loud it can be. According to the Center for Communication, the noise levels in cinemas can be loud enough that it can contribute to hearing loss. They say that there are certain cinemas that can leave your ears so stunned that it is equal to standing next to the speakers at a rock concert. This can be especially dangerous for small children.4. The Cinema Isn\u2019t As Clean As You ThinkMany cinemas will go hours before the cinema gets cleaned. In some cases, the cinema won\u2019t get cleaned at all until the last movie has ended. If the movies all end around the same time, the employees won\u2019t have the time to get to every cinema to clean before the next movie starts. The next time you go to the movies, take a look around. Chances are you will see the snacks left behind by the audience who watched the previous show.5. There is Rarely Anyone in the Projection BoothYears ago, if you looked up into the projection booth at the movies, you would see the head of an employee sitting near the projector. Today, thanks to technology and automated digital projectors, you won\u2019t see anyone sitting near the projector for most of the movie. Once the movie has started, the employee can walk away and take care of other things. For some, this fact ruins the whole wonder and mystery of the cinema.6. Snack Combos Don\u2019t Always Save You MoneyMany cinema concession stands will have posters on the menu offering combo pack deals. This could include something like a hot dog, a popcorn, and a soda. In most cases, these combo deals won\u2019t save you money at all. In fact, the only advantage that you will get by buying a combo pack is the cool paper holder that they give you to get your food to your seats easily. The next time you think that you are getting a deal at the movies, take out your calculator and do the math. Chances are, you won\u2019t be getting a deal.7. The Cinema Manager Doesn\u2019t Control What Movies Are ShownMost people believe that it is the manager at the cinema who chooses what movies are shown. When people don\u2019t approve of the movies that are being shown, they bring their complaint to the manager. Doing this would be a waste of time. It is actually the cinema\u2019s corporate office who decides what movies the cinema will show. The next time you have a complaint, send it to the corporate office and leave the manager alone.8. If You Find a Movie Offensive You Do Have OptionsIf you start watching a movie and you find it to be offensive or if you just aren\u2019t enjoying it, there is something that you can do but you only have so much time. If you approach an employee in a nice, reasonable manner and you explain what you don\u2019t like about the movie, they might let you go to a different cinema. If you want to do this, however, you need to make your complaint within the first 30 minutes of the movie.9. The cinema Staff Has To Interrupt Couples Being InappropriateMany couples go to the movies on date night. During the movie, many couples hold hands and focus on the film. There are, however, some couples who take their PDA to a whole new and inappropriate level. According to many cinema employees, they need to break up couples being inappropriate at least once a week. It must be awkward for both the couple and the employees.10. The Popcorn Isn\u2019t Always Freshly PoppedWhen the employee who works the concession stand scoops your popcorn from the machine, you automatically think that it was just popped. In some cinemas, this isn\u2019t the case. In the back room, there is a large bin full of bags of popcorn that has already been popped. When the popcorn in the machine starts to get low, the employee will refill the machine with the pre-popped popcorn.

Hope you guys like them. P.S. Please let me know in the comments section which of these 5 islands you would love to visit most! And be sure to follow KJSelections. Thanks :)1. Kauai, HawaiiKauai is an island in the Central Pacific, part of the Hawaiian archipelago. It's nicknamed \"the Garden Isle\" thanks to the tropical rainforest covering much of its surface. The dramatic cliffs and pinnacles of its Na Pali Coast have served as a backdrop for major Hollywood films, while 10-mile-long Waimea Canyon and the Nounou Trails traversing the Sleeping Giant mountain ridge are hiking destinations.2. Santorini, GreeceSantorini is one of the Cyclades islands in the Aegean Sea. It was devastated by a volcanic eruption in the 16th century BC, forever shaping its rugged landscape. The whitewashed, cubiform houses of its 2 principal towns, Fira and Oia, cling to cliffs above an underwater caldera (crater). They overlook the sea, small islands to the west and beaches made up of black, red and white lava pebbles.3. Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, EcuadorThe Gal\u00e1pagos Islands is a volcanic archipelago in the Pacific Ocean. It's considered one of the world's foremost destinations for wildlife-viewing. A province of Ecuador, it lies about 1,000km off its coast. Its isolated terrain shelters a diversity of plant and animal species, many found nowhere else. Charles Darwin visited in 1835, and his observation of Gal\u00e1pagos' species later inspired his theory of evolution.4. Kalymnos Island, GreeceKalymnos, is a Greek island and municipality in the southeastern Aegean Sea. It belongs to the Dodecanese and is located to the west of the peninsula of Bodrum, between the islands of Kos and Leros5. Boracay Island, PhilippinesBoracay is a small island in the central Philippines. It's known for its resorts and beaches. Along the west coast, White Beach is backed by palm trees, bars and restaurants. On the east coast, strong winds make Bulabog Beach a hub for water sports. Nearby, the observation deck on Mount Luho offers panoramic views over the island. Offshore, coral reefs and shipwrecks are home to diverse marine life.",  "id": "337"}

For all those successful weight watchers and calorie counters, here is the exotic recipe of lemon and coriander soup. It has a salty, tangy and refreshing taste that is enjoyable in all four seasons. Have it with some crispy toasted brown bread, and you will have a lovely wholesome meal.\nSoup is a great alternate when my children grow weary of daal (lentil). I must mention that I do not have as many episodes wherein my kids really refuse the food I serve them, not because they taste so good, but because I am blessed with darling kids. I never had to face many tantrums, regarding food or anything else, as others speak of their children.\nThe lemon and coriander combination is really loved in my house. I do not feel the inclination for feeding my family what they don\u2019t like, all in the sake of good health. And you shouldn\u2019t too. Therefore, I intend to share customizable recipes at large. Choose your favorite vegetables for this soup, but keep in mind whether that goes well with the coriander and lemon. If you like mushroom, it will go very good for this soup. Others can be cauliflower, broccoli and raw papaya.\nI love soup and just last week i also published vegetable sweet corn soup, which all of you liked. Just like sweet corn soup this soup recipe is also very easy and yummy. I have used green chilly to make it spicy but if you are making this for the kids then you can skip it.\nI learnt this soup recipe from my aunty in Gorakhpur. She prepare this simply awesome. Wish i could too. But I have tried to give it the taste like my aunt\u2019s recipe.\nIt amuses me how everything is available in the market nowadays, in a packaged processed form, from vegetable stock to lemon juice. And what amazes me the most, is that people solely rely on those, and throw away the \u201creal\u201d vegetable stock they get. Anyways, to each one his/her own, but what I do is make my own stock and a bottle of it perpetually stays in my fridge, that I update every few days. I use whatever vegetables I get to make it. I usually buy organic vegetables and fruits, from the local market, and avoid off-season veggies, as they are usually chemical treated. I venture to super market to buy the \u201csuper discounted\u201d grocery stuffJ.\nI am not using any oil and spice tempering in this recipe. If you like, you can give it a garlic tempering. I am also using Maggi cubes for added taste you can skip that too. You can add some flat noodles in it as well. My advice to you when making this soup is keep the salt in check, and always taste it 2-3times before adding more salt.\nI have used coriander (dhaniya patta) and celery stalk which you can easily buy from your local market. It adds to the flavor. But you can skip celery, if you don\u2019t want.

The troupe about the \"troublesome daughter\" is pervasive, but it doesn't seem Prince William 100 percent buys it, which is why this quote is funny.On Prince George's TV HabitNothing gets between my son and Nature Cat (or Cat In The Hat or Wally Kazaam!), so I can more than relate to Prince William when he talks about Prince George's TV habit. In an interview with BBCRadio 1, the Duke of Cambridge said, according to Hello! magazine:Some of them are really good but you have to pretend you're really interested because George gets very upset if you're not showing due diligence to the characters.On The Birth Of His First ChildAfter the birth of Prince George, Prince William said, according to US Weekly:As you might have gathered, Catherine and I have recently become proud parents\u2014of a baby who has a voice to match any lion's roar! He's pretty loud but of course very good looking!OK, so this quote is a bit of a classic dad joke, and that makes it all the more funny. Why?

{"content": "A Prayer for a Blameless HeartBy Alistair BeggI will deliver you out of the hand of the wicked, and redeem you from the grasp of the ruthless. - Jeremiah 15:21Notice the personal nature of this promise: \"I will.\" The Lord Jehovah Himself intervenes to deliver and redeem His people. He pledges Himself personally to rescue them. His own arm shall do it, in order that He may have the glory. Not a word is said of any effort of our own that may be needed to assist the Lord. Neither our strength nor our weakness is taken into account, but the lone \"I,\" like the sun in the heavens, shines out resplendent in complete sufficiency. Why then do we allow ourselves to be wounded by calculating our forces and consulting with mere men? God has enough power without borrowing from our puny arm.To enjoy peace, our unbelieving thoughts must be stilled, and we must learn that the Lord reigns. There is not even a hint of help from any secondary source. The Lord says nothing of friends and helpers: He undertakes the work alone and feels no need of human arms to aid Him. All our lookings around to companions and relatives are vain; they are broken reeds if we lean upon them\u2014often unwilling when able, and unable when they are willing. Since the promise comes from God alone, it is best for us to wait only on Him; and when we do so, our expectation never fails us.Heavenly Father, give us the courage to face each new day with all its challenges. Remind us that you are greater than our perception of who you are, and in all things, you prevail. Amen.    ",  "id": "361"}

{"content": "The number of Hongkongers suffering from hip fractures caused by osteoporosis would almost triple in about 30 years at an annual rate estimated to be one of the fastest in the region, behind only Malaysia and Singapore, according to researchers.\nThe projection was made in a study conducted by the Osteoporosis Society of Hong Kong and other researchers in Asia. They suggested that the number of new cases in Hong Kong would increase from 9,590 this year to 27,468 in 2050.\nThis rate far surpasses the population growth over the same period. According to official statistics, the city\u2019s current population is 7.5 million, with a projected figure of 8.2 million by 2050.\nReferring to the study\u2019s findings, Cheung Ching-lung, co-author of the study and a scholar from the University of Hong Kong, said: \u201cIt is an alarming increase.\n\u201cIt means greater demand for elderly services ... and an increase in the city\u2019s medical expenses.\u201d\nIt means greater demand for elderly services ... and an increase in the city\u2019s medical expenses\nCheung Ching-lung, study co-author\nOsteoporosis is a condition associated with old age, in which bones become weak and brittle.\nThe latest study, which looked into cases of hip fractures from osteoporosis in nine Asian jurisdictions, predicted that by 2050 cases in Malaysia would be 3.55 times that of current levels, while in Singapore, the figure is 3.53 times.\nCheung said both countries\u2019 high differences between the number of future and present cases was because of their younger populations, meaning they would face a surge in cases decades later as their citizens aged.\nResearchers predicted that the total number of new hip fracture cases across all nine areas in the study would increase to 2.56 million in 2050, from 1.12 million this year.\nThe total cost for patients and governments \u2013 from surgeries and rehabilitation \u2013 would rise from HK$74 billion (US$9.4 billion) to HK$117 billion over the same period.\nIn Hong Kong, this figure is expected to rise from HK$660 million currently to HK$1.9 billion by 2050.\nCheung said Hong Kong\u2019s surge in the number of cases was because of its long life expectancy and the growing proportion of elderly people in the population.\nAccording to government statistics, the average life expectancy for Hong Kong women was 87.3 years and 81.3 years for men. The proportion of the population aged 60 or older was also projected to increase from around 24.4 per cent this year, to 38.7 per cent by 2050.\nAccording to Dr Eddie Chow Siu-lun, one of the study\u2019s researchers and president of the society, the most worrying complication that could arise from osteoporosis was a hip fracture.\nReferring to past figures, Chow said around one in every five sufferers of hip fractures would die a year after the injury occurred. For those who survived, more than half would fail to regain their normal level of mobility.\nIn light of the rising trend, Chow advised people who are at risk, including elderly women and those who lead sedentary lifestyles, to go for bone density screenings and receive treatment earlier.\n  ",  "id": "376"}

{"content": "Copenhagen-based band Palace Winter are set to release their second album, Nowadays, in May.\n \nThe album starts off with an introductory song called \u201cBIRTH,\u201d lasting only just over minute. \u201cBIRTH\u201d sets the tone for the beginning of the album, and leads into the second track \u201cTake Shelter.\u201d \u201cBIRTH\u201d gives the listener an introduction for what is to come on the album.\n \nThe album flows together well. The song \u201cEmpire\u201d is more of an indie rock song than any of the other tracks. On this tune, Palace Winter give off a feeling of longing and mystique. Their lyrics are all about secrets and leaving, and the song includes a range of sounds and instruments, including strings. \u201cEmpire\u201d helps bridge Palace Winter\u2019s sound and gives some variety to the album.\nThe song following \u201cEmpire\u201d is \u201cBALTIMORE.\u201d This track slows the album down and offers more of a narrative than the previous songs. Palace Winter sing, \u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019m always looking back these days / Waiting for a reason.\u201d The lyrics are backed by an acoustic guitar as well as an electronic drum sound. This gives off a more melancholy sound than some of the other songs on Nowadays.\n \nPalace Winter End On A Thoughtful Note\n \nThe last half of the album features some of the longer songs on the album. Palace Winter get slightly more experimental on the song \u201cTHE ACCIDENT,\u201d and do not include lyrics. The song instead focuses on the synth sounds that the band uses. The last song on the album, \u201cKENOPSIA,\u201d is a slower song on which Palace Winter use a more narrative storytelling approach again. The song is a nice closer to the album, and only at about two minutes is short, but does leave the listener with room to think about the album.\n \nOverall, Palace Winter have created a diverse and thoughtful album. Nowadays will be released on May 4. \n\n",  "id": "378"}

As an actress, Meghan was already accustomed to appearing in public and commanding attention, but being royal brings with it a totally different level of public scrutiny. As she adjusts her style to meet her new position, Meghan has reportedly turned to her soon-to-be sister-in-law, Kate Middleton, for advice. Kate has a stable of designers she loves and she's recommended some of her favorites to Meghan.\"Kate is often in the studio to go over lookbooks and have fittings, and she suggested the boutique to Meghan for more formal wear,\" a source told Vanity Fair. Meghan turned to Wickstead for her outfit and to Philip Treacy for her pillbox hat for Wednesday's Anzac service at Westminster Abbey. Both designers are favorites of her future sister-in-law.\"Kate\u2019s not the sort of person to get offended if someone wears something she likes or one of her favorite designers,\u201d the source continued. \"Meghan asked her advice for formal wear and Kate told her where to go.

That assuredly helped to boost his NFL stock.     The 6-foot-3, 222-pound Lauletta has the ideal frame that teams look for and covet in an NFL quarterback. He also has decent accuracy, mechanics, and mobility as he ran a 4.81 40-yard dash at the annual NFL combine.He lacks ideal arm strength for the NFL, which is something he must work on if he wants to make the Giants roster. After all, having the arm strength to cut through the winds at MetLife Stadium in November and December is key to having any success with Big Blue.Some have compared him to San Francisco 49ers quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo, while Steve Palazzolo of ProFootballFocus noted that Lauletta was much higher on their draft board than Davis Webb was last year. He will enter training camp as the third quarterback on the depth chart and will compete with Webb to be Eli Manning\u2019s backup.It will be interesting to see whether the Giants let two untested quarterbacks battle for that job or if they bring in an experienced veteran to join the fray in training camp, as they did last season with Geno Smith.

Just a few weeks ago, in fact, Reynolds took a (proverbial) dump all over an anniversary message Jackman sent to his wife of 22 years.\n\nNow he's at it again. In a video tweeted on Friday, Jackman can barely keep a straight face as he tries to record a \"heartfelt birthday message\" while a Deadpool-suited Reynolds sings \"Tomorrow,\" from Annie, on the bed behind him.\nIt's hilarious. Especially with them breaking into \"Who Let the Dogs Out.\"\nIt might be a stretch to suggest that there's any meaning behind two high-profile acts of trolling in the space of a month... but I'm suggesting it anyway. \nWhat is Reynolds doing here? He pops up in this weird, random video, all suited up in what is surely not a cheap costume (not to mention a valuable piece of movie memorabilia). There's also the fact that, at the top of the video, Jackman says: \"I'm really, really busy doing...\" \u2014 glances at Reynolds-as-Deadpool \u2014 \"...some stuff.\"\nLook. Deadpool 2 is out on May 18. The movie's done. In the can, as they say in Hollywood. So it's not like Jackman's hanging with Reynolds to shoot some extra scenes. Even though something as simple as, say, an effects-free post-credits scene could be shot and tacked on to the end of a film in the space of a day.\nI'm probably reading too much into all of this. The video is, in all likelihood, just another bizarre aspect of Deadpool 2's intentionally weird hype train. But we know Deadpool is part of Fox's mutant universe. We know Jackman has been Wolverine before, even if he's done with the character now.\nI choose to read my hopes and wishes into all of this. Jackman-as-Wolverine is totally going to pop up at some point in Deadpool 2.

All this has long provoked a great jealousy toward me that I've been observing for a long time, but I believed he would eventually stop.Since I have a very pretty woman, my big problem was how to keep it from many other men ... However, upon my mother's address one weekend, we called my twin brother to stay all weekend with us and to go somewhere on a trip together. On the excursion we went, we took a lot of alcohol to my brother's address. Since I first got drunk, I decided to get my friend in our car and bring us all home. As soon as we came home, I immediately lay on the couch and was asleep, and that's all I remember. My wife went to our bedroom, and my brother to the guest room. Whether under the influence of alcohol or jealousy, my brother soon went into my wife's bed and slept with her. Then at that moment she thought that it was me and that I came to our room.

Before certifying a vehicle, the car dealer will inspect everything inside the car to detect even a small defect. He will make a list of all the flaws and defects in the car and starts to re-condition it. If repairs and replacement need to be done, he will always use parts from the original manufacturer. Every car dealer places safety as the top priority, and this is why he takes time to ensure every bolt in the car is new and ready for sale.\n\n\n\nRemain tension free with pre-owned certified cars \nExperts from esteemed company Ideal Auto USA state that since the car is reconditioned into a new model; the buyer can remain tension free when it comes to the quality of the vehicle.

You\u2019re not thinking that a comeback is in the works. Well, don\u2019t tell that to the St. John\u2019s Red Storm.Not only did the Johnnies comeback from a 6-3 deficit after three innings against Xavier, they blew the Musketeers away, putting another 31 runs on the board in a record-setting 34-7 victory.For manager Ed Blankmeyer\u2019s squad, the 34 runs are the most they have scored in a game since Feb. 21, 2010, when they beat New Orleans by a score of 31-6. Joe Panik, currently the second baseman for the San Francisco Giants, was St. John\u2019s DH in that contest.     The blowout comes one day after St. John\u2019s (27-11) lost their first conference game with their ace, Sean Mooney, on the mound.A 10-run fourth inning was the catalyst for the madness, turning that 6-3 deficit into a 13-6 lead. They sent 14 batters to the plate in the top of the fourth, picking up nine hits, including a home run from Jamie Galazin.The top of the order\u2014John Valente, Galazin and Josh Shaw\u2014went a combined 13-for-19 with three home runs (two from Galazin), 14 RBI and 10 runs scored.Valente, who hit leadoff on Saturday and started at third base, hit a grand slam in the top of the sixth and he has now reached base in 52 consecutive games. He is hitting .396 with four home runs, 33 RBI, has more walks (12) than strikeouts (eight), and is 10-for-13 on stolen base attempts.Saying he\u2019s one of the stars on this team would be an understatement.Pitching won\u2019t be the top storyline when you put 34 runs on the board, but starter Jeff Belge deserves a lot of credit for keeping Xavier\u2019s offense in check after those first three innings.The sophomore left-hander went five innings, gave up one run on five hits, struck out nine batters, and walked two in the win.While you won\u2019t find St. John\u2019s in any of the college baseball Top 25 polls at the moment, they are a team that is clicking at the right time with the Big East conference tournament beginning on May 24.If they can make it to the NCAA Tournament this year, it will be their fourth consecutive year making baseball\u2019s version of the Big Dance.So, while you are paying attention to the New York Yankees and New York Mets in the first months of their respective seasons, keep an eye on what St. John\u2019s is doing.They could be a team that makes some noise in the tournament a month from now\u2014perhaps even making it to Omaha and the College World Series for the first time since 1980.

And what's that well known saying, or maybe it's just common sense. Don't have a pet if you can't look after it? That's the one.Well, it seems some people just haven't quite understood - take Celia Hart as an example. She walked out of court earlier this week after leaving her two cats alone in a filthy house for a fortnight, costing one his life.In what was considered a 'shocking example' of animal neglect, 54-year-old Hart was handed a suspended prison sentence by magistrates at Swansea Magistrates Court.Hart, from Margam, Port Talbot, pleaded guilty to two Animal Welfare Act offences after her two cats, Domino and Moses, were left alone in the home which was described as 'squalid'.The pictures show cobwebs throughout the downstairs of the property, with waste piling up across various rooms. The cats had been left without food or water - leading them both to suffer unnecessarily.Hart was handed a 12 week prison term, suspended for 12 months, and told to do a 20 day rehabilitation activity requirement, as a consequence of her actions.She was also banned from keeping any species of animal for a decade, and ordered to pay \u00a3300 in costs and a \u00a3115 victim surcharge.Sadly, the lack of care provided to Moses the cat resulted in him dying. Domino, who was found emaciated and dehydrated, was rushed to a veterinary practice.Fortunately Domino responded well to emergency treatment and has now been happily re-homed.If there's any good news to come from this, it's that.RSPCA inspector, Gemma Cooper, said: \"These two defenceless cats were left abandoned, and alone, without food or water in a squalid Port Talbot property.\"It was a shocking example of animal neglect, with the poor cats given no chance in a locked, filthy property without even basic sustenance.\"The defendant showed significant remorse for her actions. This case highlights how important it is for owners to seek appropriate help for animals if their situation means they are facing problems in providing them with appropriate care.\"Simply, there's no excuse for this sort of neglect - with poor Moses dying as a consequence; and Domino dehydrated and emaciated.\"I shudder to think as to how both these poor felines suffered. Fortunately, our intervention was able to save Domino, who has now been happily rehomed.\"This comes after LADbible reported on the woman who was jailed after beating her dog for knocking over coffee.Joanne Hosking, 41, lost her temper with the poor dog when it spilled her coffee and leant over to smash it into the floor.She and her husband neglected to take their 12-month-old Jack Russell to the vet, despite the fact that she was vomiting up green bile.Hosking and her husband, 45 year old Christopher Hosking - who was not present at the time of the attack - pleaded guilty to animal cruelty offences.Hosking received an 18 week sentence whereas her husband received a six week curfew.Both of them have been banned from owning any animals indefinitely.We can't help but question, what is wrong with these people?",  "id": "411"}

And it was like time had stood still and we had only been away on a short holiday. An extremely joyful experience!\u201d\n\n\n\n\nThe songs were made for a two hour television special, which will air I December. It is co-produced by the BBC and NBC and the four piece will perform as CGI avatars. \n\nBand member, Bjorn Ulvaeus said that that he and his bandmates were digitally scanned and then their avatars were made to look younger and similar to how they looked during their last tour appearance in 1979.\n\nThe avatars are also set to do a world tour next year.\n\nAbba is one of the world\u2019s best-selling recording artists.

Lyngstad has kept a low profile so did Faltskog, although she did release a new album on 2013.\n\nThe band is known for outwardly rejecting any offers to regroup, so kudos to the avatar project that somehow ushered in this era of new music for one of pop\u2019s most legendary groups!

We\u2019ve gathered the following examples to showcase the variety of pallet shelves you could be building yourself as your next DIY project. This is one of the simplest projects you can ever find. All you have to do is add a few pieces of wood to make the platforms on which the vases and everything else will be sitting. The rest of the pallet stays intact. Similarly, you have to make just a few little changes to get this project done. Remove a few pieces, reorient others and that\u2019s about it. At the end you\u2019ll have a rustic shelf for your wall and a place to display photos. The pallet itself can be the main attraction. The items you display on its shelves are merely ornaments for the pallet. This works out great in a rustic d\u00e9cor. Another simple idea is to carefully cut the pallet in smaller sections and mount those on the wall where they can serve as shelves. You can store books inside the compartments and display decorations on top. Obviously, you can also take things a step further and dismantle the pallet and use the pieces in a different configuration. For example, make a set of simple shelves like these ones for the living room. You don\u2019t have to use all the pieces if you don\u2019t want to. Make small shelves that fit in the space you have available, such as in the area above the toilet, in the bathroom so you can add a bit of character to the space. All you have to do in order to make these bookshelves is cut a pallet and then sand and paint the shelves as desired. The method is quick and simple and you can put these bookshelves anywhere you want. This is a really great project if you want to put some shelves in the kids\u2019 room so they can organize and store their books, magazines and drawings. It\u2019s not complicated at all and you can paint the shelves an attractive color. This is basically the same project but, in this case, the shelves are not used for storing books. Instead, they\u2019re similar to a fireplace mantel and used to display seasonal decorations, framed images and photos. If you\u2019re looking for a simple way to display your small book collection, there\u2019s no need to go search for the perfect design in stores. You can make it yourself using nothing more than a wooden pallet. Personalize it however you want with your choice of paint or stain. Don\u2019t have books to display? Maybe you have a collection of DVDs, in which case building a shelf storage unit for them from a pallet is just as easy. Just remember to measure twice before you cut anything. Wooden pallets are also great for making small home bars. You can basically just mount the pallet on the wall without making any big changes to its structure and use the shelves to store your bottles and glasses. There\u2019s also the possibility to reduce the size of the bar and to outfit it with a glass rack and a few themed decorations. This can be a rustic way of displaying your wine collection without a lot of fuss or effort. Take the pallet in the kitchen where you can turn it into a practical accessory. The shelves can be used to store and organize spices, bottles and jars. Want more craft ideas?

{"content": "Wall shelves are extremely practical and versatile and they come in a lot of different styles. A particularly interesting option is actually a DIY strategy. The main idea is to turn a drawer into a wall shelf. You could opt for this strategy if, for example, you end up with an old chest of drawers which you no longer need or if you simply want your wall shelves to look special. You can customize and personalize the drawers in a lot of great and interesting ways. One simple idea is to paint them. You can have multiple drawer shelves displayed on a wall, each featuring a different color and identical designs and dimensions. Drawer shelves can be a really good option for narrow spaces such as the are between a wall and a door, a space that usually stays empty. Once again, find a way to customize each drawer. You could use colored shelf liner or paint to decorate the interior. Stack them in a playful, asymmetrical way for an eye-catching look.  Pair two drawers and display them together on a wall in a way similar to the example featured on Theperfectshadeofgrey. The whole transition from drawer to shelf involves the use of some acrylic craft paint, sandpaper, wrapping paper and glue. It shouldn\u2019t take more than one or two hours to complete the project. You can leave the drawer pulls on for more charm. Several different drawers or various shapes and sizes can be mounted on a wall in order to create an interesting display. You can remove the bottom of each drawer so the wall color becomes visible when you mount them there. They\u2019ll look similar to box shelves or cubbies.  A single drawer can become a really great and practical storage shelf for the bathroom. You can divide the drawer into two sections. Put shelf liner on the bottom to create a beautiful backdrop. You can also attach small hooks for hanging brushes and other things. You could also divide the interior of the shelf in several compartments, depending on the drawer\u2019s size and the nature of the items you can to store there. As you mount it on the wall, several shelves will allow you to use the drawer as storage for toilet paper rolls, brushes and other things. Another fun and interesting idea is to use drawers to make a unique bookcase. This is interesting because of the way the drawers are mounted on the wall. The project is featured on Addisonmeadowslane. The supplies needed include the drawers, adjustable clamps, oil based primer, spray paint, a foam roller, a piece of wood, wood screws and drywall anchors.Want more craft ideas?

{"content": "Right before we fall asleep, we pass through a semi-lucid state called hypnagogia. It's a surreal state in which you might lose your sense of self, experience a distorted sense of space and time, get lost in lucid dreams or bizarre ideas free from constraints. Geniuses through history like Edison, Tesla, Poe and Dal\u00ed have tried to channel the uninhibited creativity of the state. Some even devised a trick \u2014 holding a steel ball in their hands, which would drop as soon as they left the hypnagogia state. Awake, they could quickly jot down their impressions or ideas before they fell back asleep. Today, researchers from MIT are trying a more high-tech way to replicate that process. They designed a device called Dormio intended to extend hypgnagogia and record the \"microdreams\" we experience in the state. Dormio use sensors on an electronic glove to measure muscle tone, heart rate, and skin conductance to detect the shift from hypnagogia and actual sleep. Right when you're slipping into sleep, the device will send you a sound from a smartphone app, or a nearby Jibo robot, intended to bring you back to hypnagogia without fully waking you. The bot will also start talking to you, recording anything you say aloud. Throughout the night, Dormio can repeat the process to incept and report dreams. \"I have no doubt that Hypnagogia holds applications for augmenting memory, learning, and creativity. Yet also, after having explored the state myself, I find it to be a deeply valuable and inspiring sort of self-seeing which was inaccessible to me previously,\" wrote project leader, Adam Haar Horowitz. Dormio's team hopes to make the device commercially available one day, but for now, Dormio is an open source software. Enterprising DIYers can follow a step-by-step guide to make the circuit board, and download the software for biosignal tracking on Github.",  "id": "441"}

{"content": "Vacant schools or other idle sites in Hong Kong should be used to build temporary housing for families living in the city\u2019s so-called coffin homes, a concern group said on Sunday.\nCoffin homes, or \u201ccaged homes\u201d, are subdivided flats that derive their name from their cramped quarters. The typical living area for each tenant is 45 square feet, about the size of a ping-pong table, said Subdivided Flats Concerning Platform in Hong Kong, which conducted a recent study on coffin homes. \nEven the cost of coffin homes is increasing in the world\u2019s most expensive housing market, as the study found that families were spending 36.3 per cent of household income on rent, up from 33.9 per cent a year ago. \n\n\nAs the government begins a five-month public consultation to gather information on ways to increase the city\u2019s land supply for housing developments, the group\u2019s convenor, Lai Kin-kwok, said people living in coffin homes cannot afford to wait that long.\n\u201cThose squeezed in subdivided units don\u2019t have the luxury of waiting for the government to arrange more debates on land supply to fix the housing problem,\u201d Lai said, as he urged the government to use sites to build temporary housing. \u201cA wait of one day is already very long for them.\u201d\nConducted between January and March, the study covered 68 families living in subdivided cubicles in Kwun Tong, Tsuen Wan, Hung Hom, and Kwai Chung.\n\n\n\n\nThe average size of a subdivided unit was about 130 square feet, with rent averaging HK$4,500 (US$575) a month, according to the study. In one extreme case, a family of four in Kwun Tong was paying HK$7,800 a month for a subdivided cubicle of about 160 square feet, which was more than half of the family\u2019s income.\nThere is no legal definition in Hong Kong for a subdivided flat, but the term is commonly used to described cases where one flat is partitioned into two or more self-contained cubicles. Many of the conversions are carried out illegally, but they are often the only option for poor families, especially those waiting for public housing.\nAccording to official estimates, in 2016, there were about 210,000 people living in such subdivided units.\n\n\n\n\nIt was revealed in March that the Housing Authority would sell some 2,500 units in Sham Shui Po that were originally allocated for needy families on the waiting list. The authority maintained it would not seriously affect the supply of rental housing and estimated that the move would only make those on waiting list wait 11 days longer.\nApplicants for public housing rose from 199,600 in July 2012 to about 283,000 in December 2017.

Though it had been confirmed that Stubbs was alive before last week's premiere, it was nice to see him back in action (and with that really cool beach rover).

{"content": "Do you know how much money you\u2019ll need to live comfortably during retirement? A recent article in USA Today states that 8 in 10 Americans have no idea how much they should be saving for when they leave the workforce.\n[REITs]\nEric Kearney, an investment advisor for Retirement Wealth, says retiring on time requires that people start planning far in advance. Here are 5 tips people can take to make sure they\u2019re ready for their golden years.\n  Plan your lifestyle. Before you begin the process of financially planning for retirement, you may want to think about what you want to actually do during retirement. Will you stop working entirely, or collect a paycheck part-time? Leaving the workforce behind for good can be problematic in the event that you run out of income. If you outlive your cash in the end stages of life the consequences can be stressful. This is especially true if you\u2019re physically unable to re-enter the workforce.\nAdjust your lifestyle now. Changing your lifestyle helps you in two ways. First, you\u2019ll save and invest more money now, so that you can live more comfortably in the future.   Two, you\u2019ll be more used to living on a scaled back income when you do quit work.\nOpen a retirement fund. The time to start saving is a decade or two before retiring. Too many people wait until it\u2019s too late.  Investing early will help you build a larger nest egg. That means you can contribute less overall and gain more.\nAvoid debt. This is a good tip at any age, but when you are thinking about retiring it is even more important. When you do take on debt, make sure to try and pay it off as fast as possible. Think about maintaining a well-funded savings account to help you pay off any unexpected expenses that do come up.\nEnvision your future. It can be challenging to stay financially on track. However, if you want to have a dream retirement, you need to start saving now. Envisioning what those years will look like can help you avoid the temptation to spend.\n\nAbout Eric Kearney:\nEric Kearney (www.erickearneyadvisor.com) of Retirement Wealth, with Florida offices in Cape Coral, Punta Gorda and Bonita Springs, has been helping clients reach and maintain their financial goals for more than 16 years.

{"content": "When we talk about proper nutrition, the first thing that comes to mind is chicken breast, fat-free cottage cheese, products with the addition of \"fitness\". Often at the first stages of losing weight people make a lot of mistakes and, not noticing noticeable improvements, they throw the idea of \u200b\u200beating healthy food. Let's figure out what categorically can not be done when switching to the right food.Bad habits in the dietThere is a lot of sugar in the fruit, so I will refuse themSugar, which is in the fruit, is different from what is contained in processed foods. Fruits are rich in fiber and vitamins, which are necessary for a balanced diet. The main thing is to find the golden mean - do not eat fruits in unlimited quantities, but do not completely exclude them.Forever I will refuse harmful foodParadox, but as soon as you forbid something to yourself, the body's need for this increases at times. If you too sharply throw something you love from the diet, then you will have a hard time. It is better to control portions and remove all harmful gradually.I will not eat carbohydrates, because without them I'll lose weightYou can not do this! Correct not from carbohydrates, but from their overabundance. The food should be balanced, only then it can be considered healthy. It is necessary to reduce the amount of simple carbohydrates (it's all sweet) and give the advantage to the complex (porridge / fruit / vegetables).I'll lose weight if I give up fatThe ratio of proteins, fats and carbohydrates in your menu should be correct. If something is missing, it only slows down the process of losing weight. In addition, fats affect the health of hair, skin and nails. But not all fats are useful! Trans fats contained in margarine or oil, which are used to make french fries, only harm your body shape and body.I'll go without dinner to remove the extra centimetersMyth: If you do not eat, the feeling of hunger will increase. Over time, the metabolism slows down, therefore, and the process of losing weight will be less effective. The last meal should be 2 hours before bedtime.I'll eat only boiled breast and buckwheat, so nothing superfluousMany women are attacking this rake. To not break, you need to eat a variety. No product contains the optimal amount of all the nutrients needed for health. Therefore, to get everything you need in sufficient volume, people eat a variety of food.To not always sit on diets, get rid of bad habits and get healthy. Then it will improve not only the figure, but also the general state of health.",  "id": "458"}

{"content": "T-Mobile and Sprint have finally agreed to a $26.5 billion deal that will make T-Mobile the third-largest carrier in the United States, the companies announced Sunday. \nT-Mobile CEO John Legere will be CEO of the new company, which will continue under the T-Mobile name.\n\nThe agreement comes after two previous failed attempts to merge the two carriers. The most recent was in November of last year, when talks between the two companies fell apart amid reported disagreements over Sprint's valuation and SoftBank's reluctance to cede control of Sprint. \nSo what changed in the last five months? Well, T-Mobile parent company Deutsche Telekom and Sprint parent SoftBank reached an agreement that valued Sprint at $26.5 billion for one. Sprint Chairman and Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son will also serve on the board of the new T-Mobile, Bloomberg reported. \nBut, a more important driver may have actually been something else entirely: 5G. As Verizon and AT&amp;T move closer and closer to rolling out their 5G networks, Sprint and T-Mobile are under increasing pressure to deliver their own 5G service. \nThe two companies say they have a much better shot at taking on Verizon and AT&amp;T together than they do alone. \n\"The New @TMobile will be the ONLY company able to bring a broad &amp; deep nationwide 5G network \u2013 something no US wireless company could achieve alone in the critical early years of 5G.,\" Legere wrote on Twitter. \nThough both companies have signed onto the deal, the merger is likely to still face at least some regulatory scrutiny from Washington. \nBut if Legere has any concerns about regulatory approval, it wasn't apparent in his tweets following the announcement.\n\"With @Sprint\u2019s incredible 2.5 GHz spectrum, @TMobile\u2019s nationwide 600 MHz + our other combined assets\u2026 Together, we will build the highest-capacity mobile network in US history!! I\u2019m talking 30X more capacity than T-Mobile today!!\"\nLegere wasn't always full of praise for Sprint, though.

Recently he answered a fan who asked what Bioware was currently doing with the game. Brenon took the opportunity to assure fans that with E3 just a mere weeks away, Bioware is focused on perfecting what they will be showing off. He stated, \u201cEveryone is currently working pretty hard. We\u2019re doing a lot of iterating and polish on the content that will be the focus for EA Play / E3.\u201d\n\nIn this same Reddit thread, another user asked, \u201chow much does creating something to be shown and played at E3 distract from the actual development and production of the game itself? I know E3 is a hugely important showcase for most games and publishers, but I often wonder what effect, if any, it has on the actual game.\u201d Holmes replied saying that it\u2019s just a bit of a change in focus, from big picture to getting the details right for the showcase. \u201cIt\u2019s more a question of focus. The things we\u2019re showing have to get done at some point, but if we weren\u2019t showing it at E3 we\u2019d likely be doing it in a slightly different order.\u201d\nIt will be interesting to see what Bioware puts forward at E3 2018, as the future of the game has seemed a bit up in the air following the departure of the writer Drew Karpyshyn.

It is worth noting that the director of the thriller \"Los\" is musician Fred Durst, the founder of the famous Limp Bizkit group.The users of the network were amazed at Travolta's new appearance, and began excitedly to wait for new frames and trailer for the future picture \"Los\". Many appreciated the courage of the actor, who was not afraid of such changes, and obeyed the director's vision. Others remembered that Travolta had not dramatically changed for the role for the first time, recalling the pictures \"From Paris with Love\", \"The Battlefield - Earth\", and even \"Pulp Fiction\".The plot of the film \"Moose\" tells about the obsessive fan who pursues his beloved actor, and his insanity reaches such a degree that he decides to completely destroy the life of his idol.

{"content": "The latest results from the weekly surveys on Twitter showed equity investors are still torn between a bullish outlook on the fundamentals vs less than convincing technicals. On the bond side, investors had a change in heart on the week as 10-year yields failed to convincingly break through the 3% mark. Part of that failed move may be down to over-crowding on the short side, but as I outline below, investors may be under-appreciating the amount of quantitative tightening that has been done so far, and that which is in the pipeline\u2026 and of course the market impact of the coming full circle of the great monetary policy experiment.\n\nThe key takeaways from the stock + bond sentiment snapshot are:\n-Equity investors remain torn; bullish on fundamentals, bearish on technicals.\n-Bond investors had a change in heart on the week as the breakout through 3% seemed to fail.\n-Traders remain heavily short treasuries, but as the charts show, the Fed has been steadily reducing its holdings.\n-Quantitative Tightening may be still be underappreciated by the market in terms of scale and impact.\n1. Fundamentals vs Technicals Sentiment: The latest weekly survey results showed fundamentals net-bullish sentiment off slightly, but still at pretty optimistic levels. Technicals sentiment on the other hand went further bearish on the week. As a reminder, the survey asks respondents to indicate whether they are bullish vs bearish for technical vs fundamental reasoning. So it remains a picture of investors basically saying the fundamentals (e.g. economy and earnings) still look good, but the technicals (i.e. price action) is less than convincing.\n2. Equity vs Bond Fundamentals: Looking at the fundamentals sentiment picture for bonds vs equities, there remains a gap, with bond investors reassessing the extent of their bearishness on fundamentals steadily through this year\u2026 against stubbornly steadfast optimism on the fundamentals by equity investors.Something is going to have to give on this chart \u2013 the gap will either close by bond investors getting more bearish on the fundamentals, or equity investors capitulating on their optimism. One of those is \u201creflation\u201d the other is \u201cdeflation\u201d.\n\n3. Bond Sentiment vs the US 10-Year Bond Yield: In terms of overall sentiment for bonds, the chart below shows the net bulls (overall bullish minus overall bearish sentiment), and there was a distinct change in heart this week \u2013 presumably survey respondents are taking the so-far failed breakout through 3% as a sign that bond yields may be capped short-term\u2026\n4. Quantitative Tightening vs Government Bond Yields: One reason to be skeptical of a further surge in bond yields is the stretched speculative futures positioning. While this is not necessarily a barrier to higher yields (indeed by the chart below traders have been on the right side of the move in bonds) with positioning looking fairly crowded to the short side there is a risk of a pullback. Having said that, when a market is undergoing a major trend change positioning and sentiment can become stretched and stay stretched.\n5. Quantitative Tightening vs Government Bond Yields: And if you want a reason to expect higher bond yields, you need only look at the Fed. In April the Fed stepped up the cap for quantitative tightening to $18 billlion per month for treasuries and $12 billion per month for asset backed securities \u2013 in line with its pre-announced plan to steadily accelerate quantitative tightening. The next scheduled step up will be in July where the pace of QT will be lifted to $24 billion for treasuries and $16 billion for ABS, or a total of $40 billion per month (for context, QE3 saw monthly purchases of $85 billion).\nWhile the improvement in the growth/inflation outlook has been a key driver for higher bond yields, looking at the chart below you can\u2019t help but think that quantitative tightening is at least a contributing factor, if not a major factor in the trend of rising bond yields. And unless we hit another recession, QT is only going to accelerate.\n6. Quantitative Tightening vs the S&amp;P500: And if you think quantitative tightening is only going to cause issues for the bond market, then you may want to check out the chart below. Of course there are many other factors at play, but if you thought that quantitative easing was bullish on the way up, logic dictates that all else equal quantitative tightening will be bearish on the way down.\nDid you know we offer institutional research?

{"content": "Taro root is a starchy root vegetable, native of South India and Southeast Asia, and has been a staple in these regions as far back as 5000 BC. At present, this vegetable is grown in many areas of the world including Asia, West Africa, South America, Central America, the Caribbean and the Polynesian islands.Taro root can be used as an alternative to a potato, although it has somewhat nutty flavor when cooked. It has a dark, hairy surface, similar to coconut, and a moist while root inside.Taro root can be boiled, steamed, fried, roasted, or baked. They can be used in soups and stews or as an accompaniment to meat dishes. The taro root is a low-calorie vegetable packed with nutritional benefits. Below are some reasons why you should include this in your diet plan.Low-Cal VeggieTaro root may contain more calories than spinach or broccoli, but it\u2019s still a low-calorie vegetable altogether. Taro root will give you 60 calories for every half-cup serving. Most of these calories come from carbohydrates.Healthy Carb ChoiceAs a starchy vegetable, taro root contains more carbohydrates than most vegetables. However, its carbohydrate content comes from starches and fiber, making you to fell full for a longer period. One half-cup serving of raw taro root provides 14g of carbohydrates, 2g of which comes from fiber or 8% of the recommended dietary allowance for fiber.Low Fat and Low ProteinIf you\u2019re a vegetarian, taro root won\u2019t be very useful to you as a protein source. For every half-cup serving, taro root can only supply you with 1g of protein. This goes the same for fat because this vegetable is practically fat-free.Low SodiumTaro root contains nearly negligible amounts of sodium- just 5mg for every half-cup serving. This is a long way from the RDA of 2.300mg for healthy adults. Nevertheless, this is ideal for weight watchers as sodium induces water retention, and therefore, weight gain.Rich in Vitamins and MineralsTaro root is rich in potassium, containing as much as 310mg, or 9% of the recommended dietary allowance for every half-cup serving. Potassium is an important mineral needed for proper function of all cells, tissues and organs in the body. It is also rich in manganese, a mineral that is needed by various enzymes working throughout the body, and vitamin B6, which is involved in the breakdown of protein, fat and carbs for energy.",  "id": "480"}

It is prepared very quickly, but the taste is simply stunning. So, finely chop the onions and garlic. On olive oil fry onions with garlic for a minute or two. Then add brown sugar - it will help caramelize the onion, that is, it will have a sweetish taste and a slightly crispy texture. A minute later, pour the paprika and add the tomato paste. If the sauce is too thick - add a little boiling water. Here such smooth, fragrant sauce turns out. Here is really the taste, like a real barbecue. Now let's start the cutlet - an integral part of the hamburger. Earlier, I confess, I replaced it with sausage and ham, but all this is certainly not the case. A real good hamburger - only with a juicy fresh cutlet. Here everything is simple. Finely cut the bacon and onions, fry it well (so that the bacon becomes crisp - this is important). Add the paprika and mix. Transfer the forcemeat into a cup, season with salt and pepper, then this will be impossible. Make a groove and transfer the roasted mixture into it. Add a little grated cheese (I took mozzarella, but you can also gruer or cheddar). Mix everything well and form cutlets. The height is about 2.5 cm, the diameter is slightly larger than the roll. In a dry frying pan fry the slices of rolls. It is not necessary to say that the quality of buns will directly affect the taste of the hamburger. Look for the freshest and tastiest of you. After this, pour a little olive oil and fry the cutlets for 3 minutes on each side. When you turn the cutlet the first time - put the tops of cheese on the top (0.5 cm thick), let it start to melt slightly from the heat of cutlets. While cutlets come, cut slices of tomato and finely salad leaf. Here you can use any greens and vegetables, but I recommend starting with a basic set. Well, then everything is simple - we collect din. Bun, greens, tomato, cutlet with cheese, from above generously sauce! It turns out incredible taste. The cutlet is very juicy, while the crispy bacon fits well with tender chicken mincemeat. The barbecue sauce is so fragrant that it seems the hamburger was made on fire!)

It taps into an application by Coinhive, which mines Monero. \n\nEach time you visit the page, you'll have to confirm and select how much processing power (between 20 to 80 percent) you want to give over. \n\"We wanted to leverage new emerging technologies to raise awareness about current humanitarian crises and raise funds to support children caught up in them,\" Jennifer Tierney, UNICEF Australia\u2019s Director of Fundraising and Communications, said in a statement.\n\"The HopePage allows Australians to provide help and hope to vulnerable children by simply opening the page while they are online.\"\nMining cryptocurrency for legitimate causes isn't a new thing.

But recently, the South China Morning Post noted that Huawei has a plan B in the works: its own OS.\nHuawei is said to have been working on a homegrown alternative to Android and iOS since 2012, when rival phone maker ZTE was hit with an export ban for illegally selling devices and telecom equipment to Iran and North Korea \u2013 it\u2019s possible that the idea was avoid being left without a mobile platform as a result of falling out with the US.\nThe OS has reportedly been designed for use on phones, tablet, and PCs, but hasn\u2019t yet seen the light of day because it isn\u2019t as capable as Android, and doesn\u2019t have many apps from third-party developers.\nAt this point in the game, it seems insane to build another platform that will compete with Android and iOS. Microsoft\u2019s Windows Phone couldn\u2019t keep up, BlackBerry OS died out in 2016, and Samsung\u2019s Tizen OS has failed to catch on.\nBut with the litany of troubles Huawei has faced in bringing its products to the US in 2018 alone, it seems like having a backup plan isn\u2019t all that crazy.\nIn addition to the DoJ investigation, the company lost out on a major carrier deal in January owing to pressure from Congress; it would have seen AT&amp;T sell its phones nationwide. The following month, the heads of six American intelligence agencies warned consumers not to buy the company\u2019s handsets, over fears that it may steal users\u2019 information, spy on them to benefit China, and gain a position of power in the country\u2019s communications infrastructure.\nBut that hasn\u2019t soured Huawei on the US yet. At the end of last month, the CEO of its consumer business group, Richard Yu, said that it\u2019s still keen on earning the US\u2019 trust and delivering world-class products there.\nHopefully, Huawei won\u2019t have to resort to a foolhardy plan like launching a new OS to rival Android; the idea of building it just to prevent being shut out from phone sales entirely hardly sounds like the foundation for a successful platform.\nThe Next Web\u2019s 2018 conference is just a few weeks away, and it\u2019ll be .

{"content": "You've probably heard that breakfast is the most important meal of the day.Additionally, eating an unhealthy breakfast can be far worse than not eating at all.A healthy breakfast includes fiber, protein and healthy fat that gives you energy and makes you feel full.In contrast, an unhealthy breakfast can make you feel sluggish, cause you to gain weight and increase your risk of chronic disease.Here are the 5 worst foods you can eat in the morning.1. Muffins Despite a reputation for being healthy, most muffins are just small cakes in disguise.They're made from refined flour, vegetable oils, eggs and sugar. The only healthy ingredient is the eggs.Sometimes muffins are topped with additional sugar, or filled with chocolate chips or dried fruit, further adding to their sugar and calorie content.Muffins are usually high in refined flour, refined vegetable oils and sugar, all of which are very unhealthy.2.Breakfast Cereals Many people think breakfast cereals are a nutritious choice for children and adults.Cereal packages often include health claims, such as \"contains whole grains.\" A label may also suggest the cereal is a good source of nutrients like vitamin A and iron.In reality, these cereals are highly processed and contain only a small amount of whole grains. Also, nutrients are artificially added in a process called fortification. Breakfast cereals contain mostly refined (not whole) grains and sugar.In fact, sugar is usually the first or second item in the ingredients list. The higher on the list, the greater the quantity.Many breakfast cereals are even higher in sugar than cookies and desserts. Adding whole grains or artificial vitamins and minerals does not make them a healthy choice.3.Pancakes and Waffles Pancakes and waffles are popular choices for weekend breakfasts at home or in restaurants.Both pancakes and waffles contain flour, eggs, sugar and milk. They are cooked somewhat differently, however, in order to achieve a distinct shape and texture.Although they have more protein than some breakfast items, pancakes and waffles are very high in refined flour. Many researchers believe that refined grains like wheat flour contribute to insulin resistance and obesity.Pancakes and waffles are made from refined flour and topped with high-sugar syrups. They may promote insulin resistance and increase the risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes and other diseases.4.Toast With Margarine Toast topped with margarine may seem like a good breakfast choice, since it doesn't contain saturated fat or sugar.However, this is actually an unhealthy breakfast for two reasons.First, because the flour in most bread is refined, it provides you with few nutrients and little fiber.Because it is high in refined carbs and low in fiber, it can spike your blood sugar levels very fast.Elevated blood sugar leads to rebound hunger that causes you to eat more at the next meal, which can make you gain weight .Second, most margarines contain trans fats, which are the most unhealthy type of fat you can eat. Toast with margarine raises your blood sugar and insulin levels, causes rebound hunger and increases your risk of weight gain and heart disease.5.Fruit JuiceFruit juice is one of the worst choices you can make if you're trying to avoid hunger, weight gain and chronic disease.Some fruit juices on the market actually contain very little juice and are sweetened with sugar or high-fructose corn syrup. High sugar levels increase your risk of obesity, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes and other diseases .Even 100% fruit juice contains a lot of sugar. Consuming large amounts of fruit juice can have the same effects on your weight and health as drinking sugar-sweetened beverages .Drinking fruit juice causes your blood sugar to rise very quickly because there's no fat or fiber to slow down absorption. The resulting spike in insulin and drop in blood sugar can make you feel tired, shaky and hungry.",  "id": "494"}

{"content": "Why do cats spend so much time licking their wool? For cats licking, in addition to hygiene products, is a way to maintain a mental balance. Care for hair soothes, neutralizes emerging aggressiveness. Pouring out, the cat clears from a wool a certain amount of the substance containing vitamin, which is necessary for regulation of mental balance. If you deprive a cat of this opportunity, it will become nervous and may even perish.Why does a cat sometimes try to lick your face or hair? The first impression received by a kitten from a mother is a waste in the form of licking and washing. It is an act of care and care for him, so if the cat (or cat) tries to lick you, consider it as an attempt at maternal care to take care of you.Why do cats sometimes lick and bite woolen clothes, clubs, scarves? There are several theories, but mostly scholars believe that the reason is the same as in the previous question.Why do some people have an allergy to cat wool? Strictly speaking, the allergy is not wool, and the FEL D1 protein contained in the cat's saliva. When the cat is washed and licked, it carries the saliva to its wool, after which it can fall on furniture and carpets. Different individuals have different amounts of protein, but in the general case, the cats are less allergenic than cats. There are two ways of preventing such an allergy - bathe a cat, flushing off the wool stuff (which is not recommended to do often), or wipe a cat's wool with a special soft cloth.Why does the cat, lying on your hands, picking up his paws, \"knocking\" something? The reason is again in childhood. A kitten feeding on maternal milk, massaging the cats' belly with paws, stimulates the \"feeding\" of milk. An adult animal uses this technique to show the extreme degree of comfort and pleasure.Why do cats usually go to the hands or fall on the feet of those who do not like them? When one cat tries to scare the other, he bends his back with an arc, shakes the wool and gives out a threatening hiss. If a person does not like cats, he tries to sit calmly so that he does not attract the attention of the animal. And cat considers it a sign of affection. Do not spit, do not move - so, friend.Why does a cat try to hit a person in a head? It turns out to be a way of expressing affection, and they can express such behavior in relation to other members of their tribe, and not just people.Why do cats scratch furniture and wallpaper? It is believed that this way the cats grind their claws. But even if you offer the cat a handy nail clipper, he will gladly cut the claws about the angle of the wall or the sofa (in your absence). This is due to the fact that on the cat's paws, between the fingers, there are special glands that the cat mentions its territory.Why do cats rub about furniture, legs, tables, legs? The cats have special glands on the tail, on the sides of the head, on the lips, in the tongue, in the genitals and between the anterior paws. They use them to mark their territory. When a cat crashes about your leg, it marks you, indicating that you are \"him.\" For the same reason, cats rub about the furniture and the corners of the rooms.Why immediately after you stroked a cat, he begins to lick? There are two theories, according to one, the cat tries to get rid of your smell, the second - on the contrary, trying to taste it to \"continue pleasure.\"",  "id": "503"}

The idea that smoking cessation necessarily leads to extra pounds, is very common. Top models have repeatedly said that cigarettes help them to maintain harmony. However, daily smoking increases the likelihood of an increase in overweight, if compared with those who do not smoke. The study found that smokers consume 200 extra calories per day.Although cigarette slightly suppresses appetite, they are not at all a good way to lose weight, as demonstrated by the observation of 5,300 people. Smokers eaten less, but leaned on unhealthy food, consuming an additional 0.23 calories per gram of food. Perhaps this is due to the fact that smokers are not very attentive to their own health, if they do not abandon the bad habit. Consequently, they pay less attention to what lies in their plate. Previous studies have already shown that smokers rarely apply to fruits and vegetables.And now, scientists from Yale University have compared the caloric intake of smokers and non-smokers. It turned out that in the diet of smokers more products with high energy density. In other words, they consume less amount of food that contains more calories.

{"content": "Back to school. If you spray paint a couple of Mason jars you can make some practical and good-looking pencil holders. Paint them all different colors so you can organize your utensils more easily. Pens go in the yellow jar, scissors in the green one, etc. Another way of making organizing easy and fun is to pain chalkboard labels on the jars. Then you can write on them what you want. When you have lots of things to store in jars and not a lot of desk space, you can try stacking them and placing them horizontally. A simple mason jar can become a work of art if you put your mind to it. Get some paint and a thin brush and start the makeover. It would also be nice and useful to paint the bottom half of the jar with chalkboard paint and the top area with normal paint. When painting the jar with regular paint, start with the inside first. Spread the paint evenly and place the jars upside down. If you want to make your pencil holder feel cozy and warm you can knit a sweater for it. Wrap it around and it looks very cute. To make it easier to organize your things, you can put tags on the jars. You just need a little thread and a piece of paper. Of course, Mason jars are great pencil holders as they are and they only need extra work only if you prefer a different look for them. Want more craft ideas?

{"content": "Mount a Mason jar on a piece of recycled wood and you\u2019ll get a rustic vase. Display it in the living room, on the porch or anywhere else. Several jars can be attached to a single piece of wood. For example, you can make a trio of vases, each jar for a different flower. You can use rope to keep the jars attached to the wood panel. It\u2019s a particularly nice idea if you\u2019re aiming at a rustic, shabby chic look. Similarly, you can use jars attached to wood panels to store and display your kitchen utensils. It takes little space and it\u2019s very practical. Another idea can be to mount the jars in front of the desk and to use them for storing pencils and other items. Instead of making a vase you could make a planter. Just fill the jar with soil and add your favorite plant and you have a wall-mounted planter. Using wall-mounted jars in the kitchen is particularly functional because you get to free up counter space. It\u2019s easy to be organized when you have a jar for everything. Mount them on the wall to keep the desk free and uncluttered. You can use a similar organizing system for the bathroom. Put cotton balls, q tips, brushes and everything else on the wall where you can easily reach them. A square piece of wood placed obliquely will become a lovely sconce base for your Mason jar vase.

{"content": "Every year, software developers eagerly look forward to annual conferences where they can meet up with other techies with whom they may have worked with on any number of open-source projects. Like any other industry, there is always a theme or common thread trending, and this year that theme appears to be a focus on how the landscape of developing software and apps is changing.A Decade Of ChangesIn what was once a rather homogenous market of PCs, developers now must address issues across multiple platforms and devices. Software development companies must face the fact that today\u2019s consumer may use multiple devices across all devices, platforms and operating systems. The focus of the two major developer conferences of the summer will take a long look at how developers are now approaching such challenges as addressing the variables in how users access the Internet and how they store files. With so many toolkits and languages available, these conferences help to keep developers up to date on the latest tools and trends.Conferences Highlighted In 2018One of the year\u2019s main conferences has come and gone in February, but the ITERATE Conference held on the 27th of February in San Francisco served to highlight what developers can look forward to in October at the Monktoberfest Conference to be held in Portland, Maine. Much of what will be addressed surrounds the challenges of developing apps for Cloud computing which must, by their very nature, be accessible from literally any device running on any platform. While the biggies are Microsoft, Apple, Google and even Amazon, cross-platform apps are presenting one of the biggest challenges developers have ever faced.Once there was Microsoft and Apple and now there are many. Of course, let\u2019s not forget the contribution IBM made to the realm of computer land. The conference also sparks interest among smaller companies, who will participate for the first time, like Elinext. The combination of small and big companies is ideal for developers.The Importance Of Attending Developer ConferencesThe reason why these conferences have become so important to software developers around the world is because there is also a social aspect to the events. Not only are new products showcased but keynote speakers are chosen to outline trends within the industry. This is the one time in which developers can get that face-to-face with other professionals in the industry and often those little tidbits of shared information can set the stage for a whole new approach to apps they are currently working on. In fact, this is where many developers meet up with new faces they eventually will collaborate with online for new projects that they hope will take the world of computing by storm. That is really every developer\u2019s dream, after all.In the end, these conferences of 2018 also highlight the need for sustainability. Not only are developers seeking greener solutions, but they are looking for ways to sustain the rapid pace of keeping up with the ever-changing needs of consumers without hitting that stage of total burnout. It is best said by how the ITERATE Conference was divided. The first portion of the conference was focused on API development and design while the final part of the conference addressed developer burnout. Even if you didn\u2019t attend an earlier conference, there are several upcoming events to consider.Check out Monktoberfest in early October to get your tickets secured in advance.

{"content": "Warning: This post contains light spoilers for Westworld Season 2 episode 2.\nA face familiar to fans of Breaking Bad appeared on Sunday's episode of Westworld: Giancarlo Esposito, known for his work as Breaking Bad's Gus Fring, the proprietor of Los Pollos Hermanos and a booming methamphetamine business.\n\nEsposito made his first guest appearance on Westworld as the host El Lazo, a leader of outlaws who William (Ed Harris) was seeking out for help in order to continue on his journey through the park. Esposito's cameo in the episode \"Reunion\" was short but intensely captivating, and the story behind his appearance is surprising.\nImage: hboIn an interview with Vulture, Esposito revealed that he got the call to appear on Westworld thanks to his relationship with Anthony Hawkins, who plays the character Robert.\nI love Sir Anthony Hopkins I really loved the original movie about this particular subject matter. Although I don\u2019t watch a lot of the television series, I had watched pieces of a few episodes that caught my attention. And then I got a call. That\u2019s how it always happens!\nYou know, people know other people. In terms of how public life affects all this, I\u2019ve said some great things about Anthony, and he\u2019s said some great things about me in regards to my work as Gus Fring on Breaking Bad, so I think it was all kind of synchronous in that way.\nSpeaking with HBO, Esposito said Westworld was a show he kept his eye on and he was excited to work with Ed Harris, who he's been a long-time fan of.\nIn terms of the actual role, Esposito delivered perfectly and told Vulture he didn't want to necessarily play it with the idea that he's playing a robot, lest he think too much about it. It was such an interesting role though that he couldn't say no, he told HBO.\n\"When I first read the scene, I thought, 'Wow, what an interesting way to introduce a character who has been another character' \u2014 someone who has a multi-tiered personality who can create dissention in this world of robots and humans,\" he told HBO. \"The unexpected nature of the scene was so exciting to me, that I couldn\u2019t say no. It was such a duel in many ways: an intellectual and moral duel, even more than a physical duel.\"\nHopefully that's not the last we see of Esposito in Westworld. Who knows, he could come back as a completely different personality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",  "id": "521"}

{"content": "You might have already heard the controversies behind GMO\u2019sor Genetically Modified foods.Along with the growing population the normal way of growing foods will not suffice the requirement of people. And this is the reason why GMO\u2019s are already in the market and probably in every single cart of buyers. The reason why American\u2019s are getting fatter is the genetically modified crops along with the long blamed processed or packaged foods. You should certainly know why and how to avoid them.Studies supporting GMO and weight gain interlinkedResearches from Norway supports the fact that GMO food consumption leads to weight gain. In the study, a group of rats were fed with corn that was genetically modified and other group of rats was provided with non-genetically modified corn. After 90 days the results were so clear that the rats which fed on GM corn grew fatter and also ate more and more food compared to the non-GM diet. Not only that, rats which were on the GMO diet, their intestines had a different micro-structure, they were less able to digest proteins, and there were some changes to their immune system.This long term project in Norway investigated the health effects of genetically modified foods. There were some startling conclusions that GMO\u2019s definitely played a major role in the worldwide obesity epidemic. Other than this the GMO food ingredients have been also linked with allergies to cancer and organ damage in animals. By this we know that GMO definitely has the side effect of weight gain.In a perfect world such a study would launch more investigations on a wider scale with even more controlled variables, but instead, Americans have been kept in the dark and continue to consume GMO\u2019s without regard for the many likely side effects.How to avoid GMO\u2019sAnything that is non-organic and more in demand should be avoided. Things like corn, soy, canola, cottonseed, tomato, beets are unfortunately in demand and so they are genetically modified. Instead, the lesser eaten foods like crookneck squash, Hawaiian Papaya and others are probably the least to be genetically modified. This is the best trick you can follow to safeguard your health.Avoiding GMO\u2019s is actually good for youAlso because avoiding foods with GMO ingredients means you\u2019re highly likely to avoid foods with preservatives, additives, dyes and other chemicals. It is really good to prefer a kitchen garden in your backyard. You can grow your own food and be happy about what you are consuming is chemical free. You can also go for some local markets like farmer\u2019s market or the whole foods to get fresh and naturally grown fruits and vegetables. And if grocery store like Wal-Mart is the only option you are left with, then make sure to look for one category of non-GMO ingredients to avoid at all costs.Contributing to the movement for GMO Freedom by voting with my wallet is also a nice added bonus. And while it can be inconvenient to avoid GMOs due to their pervasiveness in our food supply, it\u2019s well worth the extra effort in so many ways.Once you avoid the GMO foods you will definitely start to see a great improvement in your metabolism. Also if proper organic diet rich in veggies are consumed, you can cut down those extra pounds on you. By constantly checking around you for ways to avoid the GMO\u2019s and ways to incorporate more and more organic stud will definitely help you in many ways. You are one who should take care of your health and sometimes (especially in this case) you should also doubt the science as well.",  "id": "525"}

{"content": "Jeff Bezos\u2019 space company, Blue Origin, has successfully completed the latest test flight of its fully reusable New Shepard launch system \u2013 bringing them one step closer to bringing private citizens into suborbital space.\nThe launch of the Blue Origin system \u2013 named New Shepard \u2013 took place from the company\u2019s West Texas launch site at 1:06 pm EDT. The craft reached an altitude of 347485 feet, the highest flight it has reached to date \u2013 before returning back to Earth with a successful landing.\nNew Shepard is ordinarily designed to reach an altitude of 62 miles, and managed to surpass that goal by a decent margin by reaching a height of 66 miles \u2013 making it the highest distance it has managed to travel thus far, and blazing past the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line\u2014the widely accepted boundary between Earth\u2019s atmosphere and outer space.\nThe rocket takes off and lands vertically by using boosters, just as we saw with SpaceX\u2019s Falcon rockets, and this test flight was carrying a passenger capsule carrying a test dummy \u2013 known as Mannequin Skywalker. It was also carrying research payloads from NASA, the German Aerospace Center, and other commercial customers. This New Shepard launch is the most recent of private space launches that are starting to blur the lines between governmental agencies and businesses that have set their sights on space. While space travel was previously reserved for agencies like NASA, companies like SpaceX \u2013 and now Blue Origin \u2013 have proven that it\u2019s possible to make space travel efficient and economical given enough resources and talent. The New Shepard launch brings Blue Origin one step closer to their goal of making space tourism a feasible option.\nThe capsule being carried by New Shepard managed to land successfully after detaching from the top of the rocket and deploying parachutes \u2013 making the eighth flight of the system since its first launch, back in 2015, a resounding success. This was the second test of the newly redesigned rocket and capsule \u2013 a redesign that has seemed to pay off.\nBlue Origin has stated that they will likely not be taking passengers into outer space aboard the New Shepard until 2019, but they have already outlined what passengers who would like a trip into space have to look forward to.\nWhen the spacecraft launches, passengers will experience two minutes of vertical ascent \u2013 after which the capsule, carrying up to six people at the time, will detach from the rocket and launch into outer space. At this point, passengers will experience weightlessness and will be able to see the curvature of the Earth through large windows \u2013 the largest windows of any spacecraft to date, in fact. After about four minutes in outer space, the New Shepard capsule will re-enter Earth and descend to the surface before landing \u2013 a process that is entirely automated. In addition to turning a profit through space tourism, New Shepard will also be available for hire by governments and private businesses in order to carry out experiments.\nAs mentioned above, the most recent launch carried experiments from a number of different agencies \u2013 allowing the test flight to play double duty by delivering equipment that can investigate the effects of microgravity on gene expression and test the ability to provide commercial WiFi access to users in space.\nJeff Bezos founded Blue Origin back in 2000 with the goal of bringing humanity into outer space while continuing to drive down prices. Only in the past few years has space travel started to become somewhat economical, and we\u2019re a long way off from the average person being able to take a trip into space, but companies like Blue Origin and SpaceX are proving that the dream of expanding outside of the reaches of our own planet may be a real possibility. In addition to the New Shepard launch, Blue Origin is also working on a heavy-lift orbital rocket known as New Glenn \u2013 a project which is set to launch in 2020.\nWhile 2019 and 2020 may seem a decent way off at this point, it\u2019s actually quite a short time in terms of space travel. With SpaceX planning to send a man to Mars within the next couple of years as well, we could see our understanding of and reach into the rest of our universe expand quite drastically within just a few years. Hopefully the Blue Origin mission goes off without a hitch, allowing those with the resources to experience the magic of weightlessness and a view of our planet that precious few will be able to see.\n\n \n \n        \n\n        \n    ",  "id": "538"}

The zone was also closed to vehicles on Sundays and general holidays from noon to 10pm.\n\n\nBut officials amended the scheme after January 2014 so that the area remained open to traffic from Monday to Friday, meaning singers such as Lui could only perform in the pedestrian zone during weekends and general holidays.\nIn his application, Lui argued the government\u2019s 2014 decision was unlawful as the commissioner for transport did not take into account the impact of the policy change on traffic and the safety of pedestrians in the zone. But Au said in the judgment the Transport Department had already carried out traffic and pedestrian impact assessments.\n\u201cIn assessing the impact on pedestrian flow, [a department employee] reviewed the related traffic censuses about pedestrian flow of the streets conducted since October 2008,\u201d the judgment read.\nLui said officials took into account a public consultation that was conducted improperly.\nHe also argued the commissioner had abdicated his decision-making power by rubber-stamping suggestions from the district council\u2019s Traffic and Transport Committee, as well as Yau Tsim Mong District Office.\nHe failed to convince the court with these two grounds as well.\nIn a 2014 interview with the Post, Lui said he had been playing music in the zone since 2010 and attracted a number of fans. With the government\u2019s decision which effectively cut his time to play music in the zone, he said he had suffered financially.\nLam Fat, a band member who had been performing in the pedestrian zone for seven years, said he had no problems not being able to play music there on weekdays because the noise would affect residents and shops.\nBut he said what needed to be sorted out was that police had told performers like him to stop playing because of the noise level even when the area was closed off to cars.\n\u201cThere were cases when some people complained to police about those performing next to us, and we got kicked out too.\u201d\n  ",  "id": "540"}

Among them, about 1.4 million were mainland visitors.\nThe figures suggested more mainland tourists returned to the city as the legacy of anti-mainland sentiments from about three years ago has died down. At that time, the number of mainland visitors was so large that many Hongkongers fought with them for daily necessities such as baby milk formula and infant diapers.\nLegislator Yiu Si-wing, who represents the tourism sector, while remaining optimistic about the outlook of the sector, noted that only 46 per cent of the visitors chose to spend a night or more in the city.\n\n\u201cOver half of the visitors just came to Hong Kong for a one-day trip. That probably showed that our hotels are too expensive,\u201d said Yiu, who urged the government to zone more land to build hotels in the future.\nHe also urged officials to develop more tourist destinations to attract more visitors to stay longer in the city.\nThe March improvements followed an exceptional boost in visitor numbers in February, when the city saw a 26.3 per cent growth in visitor arrivals, compared to a year ago, thanks to the Lunar New Year, which fell in the middle of February this year.\nFor the first three months, Hong Kong received 15.61 million visitors, an increase of 9.6 per cent from the same period in 2017.\nIn 2014, a record 60.8 million visitors came to the city.

{"content": "PHOTO: Adam Clark\nCoping with the end of a season you love is one of life's biggest challenges, especially for skiers. Winter is our best time of year--full of friends, fond memories, questionable decisions, and deep powder snow. Often, the pain of rising temperatures and melting snow can feel overwhelming. \nAs warmth returns to your fingers, your shin bang starts to heal, your toes are no longer falling off, and your knees gradually re-lubricate themselves, you may experience a range of difficult and unexpected emotions; from shock or anger to disbelief, guilt, and profound sadness. These emotions are cyclical, resurfacing during this time every year, which can lead some of you to feel like this pain is bound to happen again and again and again. We understand.\nThe pain of having to hang up your skis can also disrupt your physical health, making it difficult to sleep in your own bed, eat (foods other than meats, cheeses or beer), or even think straight. Returning to a regular schedule of bathing can also be troublesome to navigate and can lead to feelings of confusion. Perhaps you\u2019ve grown a beard and find yourself unrecognizable after shaving for the first time (you too, ladies). These are normal reactions to the end of winter. But while there is no right or wrong way to grieve, there are healthy ways for skiers to cope with this change of season. \nThese tips can help ease your sadness and help you come to terms with the loss of winter, find new meaning for your life, and reemerge as a productive member of society again--until next fall.\nFind a supportive community:\nGrief caused by the loss of winter can often lead us to feel alone and isolated. You are not alone. While the end of winter occurs at different times throughout the northern hemisphere (and might not happen here or here), it happens to everyone. \nTurn to your friends and family members for support. Now is the time to lean on those who best understand your grief--your bartender, the seasoned lifty, your local ski tech. By engaging in open and honest dialogue about your feelings at this time, you can help each other overcome the obstacle of grieving the end of another ski season.\nTake time for self care:\nWhen you're grieving, it's more important than ever to take care of yourself--especially considering the crap you put your body through over the past five to six months. You've slept on floors, dirty couches, in the back of your car; you haven't eaten well; you've certainly over-served yourself on one or seven occasions; not to mention the sheer brutality of actually skiing. You deserve a break, a chance to let your mind reset, your body to heal, your liver to dry out. Only then can you truly process the changes at hand and let yourself feel your feelings.\nDon't be afraid to express those feelings by posting a #tbt powder shot on Instagram captioned with a John Muir quote (some do\u2019s and don\u2019ts) and make sure to tag the close friends you probably won\u2019t talk to again until the first snow of 2018. \nDon't let anyone tell you how to feel--your grief is your own and no one but you knows when you're ready to \"move on\" from skiing. It's okay to cry, shout, or even laugh. Try subscribing to The Skier\u2019s Magazine for some solace. Additionally, keep an eye out for emotional triggers that could upset you. If seeing your skis by the door in the heat of July will bother you, plan ahead and store them out of sight. \nThink reaching into your pocket to find the crust of a chairlift sammie (or the crust of a \u2018roach) could set you off? Make sure you empty your jacket pockets sooner instead of later.\nSeek professional help:\nThe sadness of a changing season never goes away completely, but it shouldn't paralyze you from enjoying off-season activities you love, like rollerblading. However, sometimes the loss of winter, especially one filled with powder days like this, is so severe, you may need to seek outside help in coping. \nDon't be embarrassed or ashamed--the bond you share with skiing powder snow is deep and meaningful. We suggest finding the oldest, saltiest, most weathered skier you know, someone experienced in coping with these changes for 60-plus years, and let them know you\u2019re struggling. Skiers help skiers.\nStay hopeful:\nThe bleakness of summer may seem imminent now, but fear not--winter will return again. It\u2019s just on the horizon, really. And just think--on your last day of skiing, just remember--only 364 more days until next year\u2019s closing day.\n ",  "id": "543"}

{"content": "Overstock.com knows the days are long gone when people would call or email about problems with its products or service. That\u2019s why the online retailer now converses with its customers most frequently through text messages.\nSince rolling out a new customer service channel based on text messaging in December, Overstock.com has seen a 98 percent open rate when communicating with people through texts, according to the company. That\u2019s a significant improvement in Overstock.com\u2019s ability to reach and help customers, since the company\u2019s email open rates average between percentages in the single digits and low teens, said Tyler Cook, product management and development executive at Overstock.com.\n\u201cSMS is a form of communication we use naturally in our day-to-day lives,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople get a ton of email, so it tends to get lost in people\u2019s inbox, and they won\u2019t respond to it. We are finding texting has more success.\u201d\nOverstock.com, which sees 30 million unique visitors a month, uses Quiq text messaging software to inform its customers that their order has shipped and arrived, or that a package is late, will be returned or replaced. From Overstock.com\u2019s mobile site, app or customer service line provided online, people can text the company\u2019s roughly 500 customer service associates 24/7 about concerns \u2014 or anything they want.\n\n\u201cThey can say, \u2018Hey, I found this really cool couch on your website, but I don\u2019t know which lamp I want it to go with,\u2019 and we\u2019ll give them suggestions,\u201d said Cook. \u201cOr, if someone wants to do a return, we\u2019ll help them there. We\u2019ll service them just like with a normal phone call.\u201d\nSince the feature rolled out, Overstock.com has received 14 percent fewer phone calls, according to Cook. Cook believes this is because texting puts the timing of service in the customer\u2019s hands. \u201cWith text messaging, someone can start a conversation at 9 in the morning and come back to it whenever they want, and we can pick it up from there,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to start the entire conversation over again.\u201d\nThe company also saves money with the feature because it reduces the number of hours needed to help customers, Cook said. With texting, one customer service rep can help seven people in the same amount of time that it might take to help one person over the phone, he said.\nOverstock.com isn\u2019t cutting the number of its customer service reps, though. Instead, the company is allocating the time saved to other operational tasks such as ensuring packages are shipped correctly, which will help the overall customer experience, said Cook.\nEventually, Overstock.com plans to use texting for more than customer service. In the \u201cnear future,\u201d the company said it will use texts to send promotions and offers for products it sells online.\n\n\n",  "id": "548"}

But any red carpet event, West is most likely not happy. \"He hates red carpets,\" Kim shared. Good to know. While on the show, Kim divulged more about West than ever before \u2014 most importantly, she shared the fact that he ushered his new daughter, Chicago, into this world with a rousing game of Connect Four. (Unfortunately, she didn't get to his Donald Trump tweets.)

{"content": "If the world is going to end, why not have it be for a ridiculous, insane reason?\nLike, say, building nuclear power plants on top of a barge and sending it floating up to the Arctic?\nWell, that one\u2019s real. If you wanted to panic now, we wouldn\u2019t blame you.\nOn Saturday, Russia launched Akademik Lomonosov, the world\u2019s first floating nuclear power plant, out of the St. Petersburg shipyard. It\u2019s currently being towed to Murmansk, a port town in northwest Russia, where it will be loaded up with fuel; its destination is a town in the Arctic Circle called Pevek, where it will begin generating power in the Summer of 2019, according to The Independent.\nThe power plant has no propulsion of its own, but is being towed up North to avoid the steep cost of shipping it by land piece by piece to remote areas. Once it\u2019s there, it will provide electricity to a town of 100,000 people. The Lomonosov will also power oil and gas mining rigs \u2014 now that global warming has opened up new shipping routes and access to fossil fuels in what used to be impassable parts of the Arctic, Russia is deploying more resources to take advantage.\nOnce it arrives, the reactor will replace the Bilibino nuclear power plant and Chaunskaya coal power plant, which were built in 1974 and 1961, respectively. Nuclear power, though cleaner and arguably a better option for our warming planet than the coal plan that Lomonosov will replace, is still a risky business. And put that on a boat, which, unlike a nuclear submarine, is exposed to the weather conditions of the Arctic? It feels risky to say the least. Critics have dubbed the project \u201cfloating Chernobyl\u201d and \u201cnuclear Titanic.\u201d\nRosatom, the government-owned Russian energy company that developed the Lomonosov, released a statement saying that the floating reactor will be \u201cinvincible\u201d to tsunamis and other natural disasters, and that it has met all the requirements of the International Atomic Energy Agency. The company argues that they have rendered Lomonosov harmless to the environment.\nYet for some reason activist groups, as well as the governments of Norway and Sweden haven\u2019t been reassured that a big-ass, freely-floating nuclear reactor will be safe. The same goes for the oil mining operations, which have a tendency to leak, polluting the delicate (and already threatened) Arctic ecosystem.\nThe stakes are high, and surely Rosatom has every incentive to get this right \u2014 should something go wrong, years of expensive planning and testing go down the toilet, along with any fossil fuel mining operations that the plant would have powered. Oh and, you know, the widespread devastation that would result from a nuclear accident in the already-threatened Arctic ecosystem, and everywhere else the irradiated ocean water may travel.\nFingers crossed everything goes the way Rosatom says it will, and not the way an apocalyptic film might.\n",  "id": "550"}

Can you guess which one it is?It is your connection with All\u0101h Mighty and Majestic!To establish this connection, you have to have the noble qualities of taqw\u0101 (piety and fear of All\u0101h) and tawakkul (reliance on Him) in you.Be abundant in du\u2019\u0101 (supplication) asking Him to bless your marriage, to keep your marriage safe from every calamity \u2013 whether big or small, and to make it easy for you and your spouse to follow the mub\u0101rak (blessed) Sunn\u0101h of the Prophet (Nabi) Muhammad (All\u0101h bless him and grant him peace).In conclusion here are two points of advice, for those who wish to embark on the journey of marriage that will facilitate all of the forgoing insha All\u0101h:The Spouse: Choose a spouse who has Taqw\u0101 (piety and fear of All\u0101h).

If you have a lavish wedding where commands of All\u0101h are violated openly and without any reservations and where the Sunn\u0101h of His Beloved Messenger (All\u0101h bless him and grant him peace) are nothing more than mere \u2018window dressing\u2019 then there is no guarantee whatsoever that your marriage will last long and if it does then it will be void of the barak\u0101h and the blessings.",  "id": "551"}
{"content": "Islam is the complete code of life. According to Islam family makes up the society. The family is formed of man and woman and it is extended by producing children. After getting married it\u2019s the responsibility of the husband to take care of his wife in all aspects. Every Muslim must realize that one\u2019s spouse is first and foremost on another. It\u2019s the duty of all Muslims that they should give respect to one another. Husband and wife have been greater rights upon each other because they have to live together.Husband and wife should strive to make one another happy and take into consideration the needs, abilities, and weaknesses of the other. Our beloved Prophet (\ufdfa) advised the husbands to treat their wives in the best way. This is clear in the following hadith: \u201cThe best of you is the best of you to their family and I am the best of you to my family.\u201dIn another hadith Holy Prophet (\ufdfa) said: \u201cI entreat you to treat women well for they have been created from a rib and the most curved part of a rib is the upper part. If you insist on straightening it, you will break it. If you leave it, it will remain curved. So, I entreat you to treat women well.\u201d (Bukhari)In Holy Quran, Allah Almighty says: \u201cAnd of His signs are that He created for you from yourselves mates that you may find tranquility in them, and He placed between you affection and mercy. Indeed in that are signs for a people who give thought\u201d (Quran, 30:21). Below we will discuss some basic rights of wives upon her husband or you can say duties of the husband for their wives.To feed her, spend upon her in a way that Allah Almighty commanded in Holy Quran. In one of hadith Prophet Muhammad (\ufdfa) said: \u2018Give charity.\u2019 A man said: \u2018O Messenger of Allah, I have a Dinar.\u2019 He said: \u2018Spend it on yourself.\u2019 He said: \u2018I have another.\u2019 He said: \u2018Spend it on your wife.\u2019 He said: \u2018I have another.\u2019 He said: \u2018Spend it on your son.\u2019 He said: \u2018I have another.\u2019 He said: \u2018Spend it on your servant.\u2019 He said: \u2018I have another.\u2019 He said: \u2018You know best (what to do with it).\u201d (Sunan an-Nasa\u2019i)Give dowry to wife. In Holy Quran Allah Most High says about the right of dowry in these words: \u201cAnd give women their dowries as a gift. Then, if they are pleased to give some of it to you, consume it with good health and enjoyment.\u201d ( Quran, 4:4)Support is one of the most important rights of the wife over her husband. Allah Almighty says in Holy Quran: \u201c\u2026And upon the father is the mother\u2019s sustenance and her clothing according to what is reasonable. No person shall have a burden on him greater than he can bear\u2026\u201d (Quran, 2:233)It\u2019s the duty of the husband to be kind to her and to not harm her. Prophet (\ufdfa) said in one of His hadith: \u201cThe perfect man in his faith among the believers is the one whose behavior is most excellent, and the best of you are those who are the best to their wives.\u201d (Tirmidhi)A husband should not expose the secrets of his wife. The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) said: \u201cThe wicked among the people in the eye of Allah on the Day of Judgment is the man who goes to his wife and she comes to him, and then he divulges her secret.\u201d (Sahih Muslim)The man must not curse or swear at his wife or insult her appearance.A man should not hate his wife. Allah\u2019s Messenger (\ufdfa) said: \u201cA believer must not hate (his wife) believing woman; if he dislikes one of her characteristics he will be pleased with another\u201d. (Muslim)In short, it is proven that Islam gives women enough rights as a religion, it is then up to us, as men, to further their rights and help them attain the level of equality they deserve. May Allah Almighty give us the strength to live our lives according to Islamic teachings!",  "id": "552"}

Apple Maps also lets you use its service offline on your iPhone, though the feature is not as straightforward as it is on its competitors.While it doesn't offer an obvious option for offline navigation outright, Apple Maps nonetheless has this feature built in, as it caches your current destination and saves it until you end your route. This means that even if you enter an area with poor cellular service, navigation will still go relatively smoothly as long as you have \"Location Services\" enabled. You can also pull up basic maps for locations offline.\n\nGetting Offline NavigationTo get directions, while connected to the internet, input the address you'd like to go to as you normally would in Apple Maps. Tap on \"Go\" once you've chosen the best route, then wait for the route to load and navigation to fully commence.With the route saved on Maps, you're free to turn off both your cellular and Wi-Fi connections. Navigation, along with alternate route selection (that saved) will still work as normal as long as \"Location Services\" is turned on, though you won't be able to get additional services that require an internet connection, such as adding pit stops, in addition to traffic data and other information. Viewing Maps OfflineAny navigation you have going will come to a standstill if both the internet connections and \"Location Services\" are disabled, but you'll still be able to access the map along with any saved routes that you can use for reference. You'll still also have the ability to view points of interest like restaurants that saved within the general area of your route.If you just want to create an offline map without getting directions, all you have to do is be connected to the internet, then load the area you want in Apple Maps.

One player hosts the game, and the others join them. Everyone gets a cabin, though only the game\u2019s host can live in the big house \u2014 meaning your squad are basically your farmhands. Still, at least everyone gets a shared pool of income and free reign to woo any of the available townsfolk \u2014 so not being able to have access to a shared farm when the host is offline seems like a small price to pay.\nThe co-op mode does seem to break the game in one way \u2014 early livestreamers have revealed the game won\u2019t play cutscenes for either host or guest, even if one of you is starting a new game.

{"content": "Open plan offices are increasingly popular, and can be found in a diverse array of workplaces: from premium headphone manufacturers, to even international spy agencies. But they\u2019re also, let\u2019s face it, pretty awful.\nProponents of the open-plan office design f\u00eate the fact that it permits greater collaboration \u2014 if you can see your co-workers, it\u2019s easier to strike up a conversation with them and share new ideas. That\u2019s good for company culture. However, the downsides more than outweigh that, as open plan offices are hugely distracting. Your productivity suffers if your concentration breaks whenever someone sneezes, or strikes up an unwelcome conversation with you.\nCountless companies have tried to address this problem with technology. Plantronics, for example, spent millions of euros on building a headquarters that used soundscaping to filter out distractions. And today, a New York-based company called ROOM (their caps, not mine) announced its new soundproof \u201cprivacy pods,\u201d which can be installed within an office to create pockets of isolation.\nROOM\u2019s privacy pods are a little bigger than a phone booth, and come shipped flat packed. According to the manufacturers, they take just thirty minutes to assemble. Once built, they can easily be moved to another part of the office.\nFrom the pictures included with the press release, the ROOM pods have a small ledge big enough for a laptop, and are large enough to include a chair. It\u2019s not implausible to imagine using this for day-to-day work, although it\u2019ll undoubtedly be a little claustrophobic, especially if you\u2019re used the the airy spaciousness of a conventional office.\nThe front of the booth is constructed primarily out of glass, allowing anyone to see if it\u2019s occupied without blindly barging in. Overall, ROOM says its privacy pod is built with 60 percent recycled plastic bottles.\nIt\u2019s also soundproof. Not only will your concentration remain unbroken by the cacophony of coughing and ringing phones, any conversations you have within the booth will remain private.\nIt mercifully also comes with a built-in fan and ventilation system, which is probably for the best, especially during those in hot summer months. Some smells cannot be unsmelled.\nROOM already has a long list of pre-orders for its privacy pods. At $2,995, they\u2019re not cheap. I also can\u2019t help but feel they\u2019re a sticking plaster over a bigger problem.\nOpen plan offices just aren\u2019t that great. A 2014 study from Ipsos laid bare the distracting nature of this popular office design, showing that on average, workers lost 86 minutes a day due to distractions.

{"content": "Amidst a slew of new equipment coming down the pipeline for U.S. Marines is a new designated marksman rifle. The M38 scoped rifle is designed to give Marine infantry squads the ability to hit individual targets at ranges of up to 600 meters with greater precision than Marines equipped with ordinary M4 carbines. According to Marine Corps Times the rifle will be fully issued by September 2018. After 9/11, the U.S. Army and Marines saw a need for a rifle that could reach out and hit targets at a greater distance than the typical M4 carbine or M16A2/A4 rifle could manage. Typically, such a rifle would be equipped with a long range telescopic sight bipod, and ideally have some work done by military armorers to increase accuracy. The U.S. Marines created a designated marksman position to carry the rifle and used a variety of designated marksman rifles (DMRs) including the M39 Enhanced Marksman Rifle and the Mark 12 Special Purpose Rifle.Soldiers and Marines called designated marksmen typically earn that title by being the best shots in their squad or platoon. Designated marksmen received instruction in shooting farther than the average rifleman, particularly the means to negate the effects of gravity and wind on a 5.56-millimeter bullet. Despite this designated marksmen are still riflemen at heart and train to shoot shorter distances than snipers.Leupold TS-30A2 Mark 4 MR/T scope on a M38 Squad Designated Marksman Rifle.\n\n\n\nNow the Marines are preparing to field a new DMR, the M38 Squad Designated Marksman Rifle. The M38 is basically a M27 Infantry Automatic Rifle with a Leupold TS-30A2 Mark 4 MR/T scope. The M38 shoots 5.56 rounds, the same as the Marines\u2019 M16A4, M4, M249, and M27 rifles and takes the same thirty round magazine. It can technically shoot fully automatic but as a SDMR rifle, it will primarily shoot semi-auto. It is based on the Heckler and Koch 416 assault rifle and equipped with a 16.5-inch barrel. The TS-30A2 Mark 4 MR/T scope was formerly on the Mk. 12 Special Purpose Rifle. It has a magnification range of 2.5 to 8 power and at full magnification has a field of view of 13.6 feet. It is waterproof, fogproof, and shockproof. The TS-30A2 is a second focal plane optic, which means the scope reticle will appear the same size no matter what power the scope is dialed to. The Marine Corps Times says that the M38 SDMR has been issued to all three Marine Expeditionary Forces. The M38 will be issued at a rate of one per thirteen man Marines infantry squad. In addition to the M38, the Marines are receiving a new sniper rifle and plan to equip regular infantry with 15,000 M27 automatic rifles. \n\n\n\n\n\n",  "id": "569"}

{"content": "At the southwestern corner of Antarctic continent, there\u2019s a river of ice dubbed the \u201cmost dangerous glacier in the world.\u201d On Monday, American and British scientists officially launched a venture to investigate Thwaites Glacier. Their goal: to figure out whether it\u2019s headed for a catastrophic collapse in the near future.\nWe already know Thwaites Glacier is melting at a rate of about 40 centimeters per year, according to the BBC. That alone has caused about 4 percent of the world\u2019s sea level rise we\u2019ve seen in the past 25 years.\nAs if that weren\u2019t startling enough, scientists are worried Thwaites is about to make a much bigger splash: if ocean waters have infiltrated far enough beneath this glacier, its Florida-sized-mass could begin sliding off land and into the ocean.\nIf that happens, estimates (that, granted, range widely) suggest that could raise global sea levels by between 2 and 10 feet.\nImage Credit: NASA\u201cFor global sea-level change in the next century, this Thwaites glacier is almost the entire story,\u201d New York University geoscientist David Holland told The Washington Post. Holland, along with his collaborator from the British Antarctic Survey, are the leaders of one of six field missions that make up the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration (ITGC).\nThe project is the largest scientific Antarctic collaboration seen in decades, involving over 100 scientists from all over the world, with an estimated final cost of over $55 million. It will include measures of the rates that ice volume and ice mass are changing, and rely heavily on remote submersibles to investigate just how much salt water has moved beneath the glacier.\nThe researchers will be accompanied by an all-star cast of non-humans. Seals will be fitted with sensors that monitor the temperature of the water through which they swim, according to the BBC. Also in the mix: the submarine known as Boaty McBoatface.\nAccording to The Guardian, current estimates of sea level rise by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change already forecast an average rise between 9.8 and 15.7 inches, if we maintained current greenhouse gas emissions \u2014 without factoring in the collapse of Antarctic glaciers.\nProbing Thwaites\u2019 condition, then, is clearly of global importance.

Featuring an intriguing story and a game structure offering a long-lasting experience, P7 contains the deepest game mechanics yet in a Remedy game.\u201d\nWhile there\u2019s no big details other than that to reveal what kind of game Project 7 will be, it will be interesting to see how the latest game will fit in with previous games from Remedy Entertainment, as well as those from 505 Games. Will Project 7 have a similar style to that of Quantum Break or Alan Wake? 505 Games clarified that the press will be getting a hands-off look at the project, and while that may be disappointing, it will still be unique and definitely worth keeping an eye out for at this years E3 conference. And, at the very least, we\u2019ll find out a bit more about the game, find out the actual title, and hopefully, fingers crossed, we\u2019ll get to see an epic trailer.

It may seem like it\u2019s lending gravitas to your operation.\nBut to the outsider it sounds ludicrous.\nWhat is the first thing that comes to mind is when you hear the word \u201ccommittee\u201d? It reminds me of student council meetings in high school: riddled with bureaucracy, grandstanding and full of people speaking up who don\u2019t know what in tarnation they are talking about.\nMoreover, it\u2019s laughable for a small firm to have an investment committee because half the firm is included. It\u2019s preposterous to assert that the investment associate with three years of experience who has failed level two of the CFA exam twice is going to be making decisions that impact whether or not people get to retire. In reality there\u2019s one decision maker, usually the one paying the salaries, and everyone debates back and forth but at the end they all have to agree with him or her or else they\u2019ll get fired.\nDon\u2019t be ridiculous.

They stepped out the same day Prince Louis was born, they've worn matching polos, and even with their wedding right around the corner, they still made time to attend multiple events on Anzac Day.All of that is changing, though. The royal couple is reportedly taking a hiatus in order to focus on their big day, and it means that we won't be getting any more Meghan Markle fashion hits until she's in a wedding dress saying \"I do.\" It's assumed at this point that the couple will not be making any more public appearances until they wed. Kensington Palace traditionally reports the dates of official royal engagements ahead of time, so that royal fans around the world are up to date on what family members are up to. What's notable about their current schedule, though, is the distinct absence of Harry and Meghan. Without any visit dates in the near future, it's quite possible that Harry and Meghan are stepping back from the spotlight in advance of their wedding. Truthfully though, taking leave isn't that unusual.They are currently preparing to tie the knot on May 19, and their last appearance on Anzac Day (where Meghan quite literally wore many hats), was only last week, when they honored fallen veterans from Australia and New Zealand.

As the name suggests, the disease attacks the human organs in the lung areas marked by early symptoms such as chest pain, cough with phlegm occasionally, often sweating, especially the palms and difficulty breathing (Asthma).Well, here are the bad habits that must be reduced to minimize the risk of getting wet lung disease.1. Smoking and alcoholic beverages.It has been proven that smoking can damage our organs especially the lungs. Alcohol addiction makes a person's health condition worse and reduces your immune immunity. For those of you who every day to consume cigarettes, from now on reduce little by little to avoid the wet lungs.2. A dirty environment.In a dirty and shabby neighborhood there must be a lot of bacteria and viruses, let alone wet lung disease arising from bacteria and viruses. Bacteria and viruses can enter into the human body through air, water, and many other media contained in a dirty environment. So from now on let's keep our environment clean.3. Throw garbage carelessly.By littering can be sure will be many bacteria and viruses that breed so that it can enter into our body. Stop throwing away used tissue, sanitary napkins, or other objects that can trigger arbitrary bacterial proliferation. Bacteria that are inhaled from the rubbish above can trigger many diseases, one of them is the wet lung.Therefore let's change our habits become healthier. With a healthy condition ensured all activities will run smoothly and positive thoughts will be easier to emerge.Source: www.halodokter.com/ciri-ciri-paru-paru-basah-dan-cara-mencegahnya",  "id": "586"}

When you\u2019re raging pissed and throwing a socket wrench at the neighbor\u2019s kids, you are not self-conscious about your state of anger.

The exterior of the house is clad in timber slats that have been stained to resemble the dark volcanic stone common in the area.

In the northeast corner of the home, the roof slants up, resembling the pitched roofs of most homes, while the rest of the home is flat roofed, which accents the peaked portion even more and breaks up the straight lines and right angles that dominate the rest of the house. The two-story construction allows for single and double height spaces. Windows seemed to be randomly placed from the outside, but inside you discover that they are in strategic locations so that they serve as frames for the picturesque setting.

Wiretap will be releasing Stringer\u2019s debut LP this summer, and \u201cGhosts\u201d is just the first single from the album. Already, the band shows that they know music and they know fun. They have the rock and roll spirit, something hard to find in music these days. But the song is more than a care-free tune, it carries an intriguing message.\n \nMax Kagan, the frontman for Stringer, said, \u201c\u2018Ghosts\u2019 is a song about growing up in New York, watching your city change and feeling nostalgic for the \u2018good ole days,\u2019 while at the same time being resentful of those all too familiar complaints, the tired observations and the cottage industry that is New York nostalgia.\u201d\n \nThematically, the song is about home and the roots we plant. In the same way, I think that musically, Stringer taps into the roots of the angsty punk attitude. Kagan proves that when he later said, \u201cReally makes ya think, but you shouldn\u2019t think you should jump around and smash things.\u201d\n \nStringer\u2019s Music Exemplifies Pure Punk\n \nI can\u2019t help but draw a stylistic parallel between Stringer and the surf/skate punk band FIDLAR. The vocal patterns are similar, with an energetic hollering, and several backup vocalists. The vocals resemble pure punk and are really the cornerstone of the song. \u201cGhosts\u201d is a song you could imagine being played live at a skate park or house party. It\u2019s accompanied with a rising guitar solo that absolutely steals the show. The music is produced remarkably well for a newer band, too.

BUT, once you arrive, you find out that meal does NOT include the drink you expected! What would you do? Smash through a nearby window with a chair? At least one woman from Staten Island, New York, can relate.Surveillance footage from Sunday, April 29, shows an enraged woman flipping off employees and throwing a sign before smashing a window with a chair, all because she thought her meal was supposed to have a drink included. \n\nEmployees attempted to reason with the irate customer, saying she may have mistook their $4 meal deal for a similar special at Wendy's which DOES include a drink, but the situation had passed words.\n\nThe NYPD is calling on anyone who knows the woman to step forward, and believe her to be between 18 and 25. Charges against her probably include \"failing to restrain one's true feelings.\"Half of Twitter was incredulous:The other half, however, was understanding:Maybe we could all benefit from a few deep breaths the next time we visit a fast foo establishment.

{"content": "Boeing and NASA are working together in order to build the Space Launch System (SLS). The rocket is believed to be capable of transporting humans and cargo into deep space. According to reports, the rocket is estimated to be the most powerful rocket system ever built. Boeing also set up a promotional website for the rocket in which it calls out Elon Musk\u2019s company SpaceX, calling the Falcon Heavy too small for deep space exploration.\n\u201cThe Falcon Heavy launch turned heads in February, but SpaceX\u2019s rocket is a smaller type of rocket that can\u2019t meet NASA\u2019s deep-space needs,\u201d the statement on Boeing\u2019s site reads, in which the aerospace giant called the SpaceX Falcon Heavy too small for deep space. \u201cOnce the Boeing-built SLS is operational, it will be the most powerful rocket ever built.\u201d\nSuch statements of the aerospace giant come after NASA\u2019s head of human spaceflight, Bill Gerstenmaier, reportedly said in March that the SLS will be equipped with certain \u201cunique capabilities\u201d that the Falcon Heavy lacks at the moment, ARS Technica reports.\nAfter making those claims, Gerstenmaier couldn\u2019t explain why NASA needed the SLS, as it\u2019s still in the building process and yet to make something that can take advantage of mentioned \u201cunique capabilities,\u201d ARS Technica noted.\nAccording to the report, it\u2019s strange that Boeing speaks of the SLS as if it\u2019s going to be built and ready for launch in the near future. In reality, the booster stage is not going to be capable of flight for at least two years. Furthermore, the rocket won\u2019t come anywhere close to the \u201cmost powerful rocket\u201d tag, as the report notes.\nRight now, the rocket with the \u201cmost powerful rocket\u201d tag is still Saturn V, which NASA used during the Apollo missions when sending men to the Moon. The rockets were capable of carrying 118 metric tons into low Earth orbit (LEO).  The first SLS rocket will be capable of lifting 70 tons to LEO, that is a tad higher compared to the 64 tons of the Falcon Heavy.\nOther, higher configurations of the SLS estimate that the rocket will be capable of lifting 105 tons, which is expected to be achievable in the mid 2020s. Moreover, it will cost the space agency billions of dollars. As the report notes, the 130-ton configuration of the SLS, \u201cthe most powerful rocket ever,\u201d doesn\u2019t have a timetable and it\u2019s unknown when it\u2019s going to get built. That being said, some time is going to pass until the company can really call the Falcon Heavy too small for deep space.\nRight now, Elon Musk, the SpaceX CEO is focusing on building his Big Falcon Rocket (BFR) launch system, which is, as he says, going to take humans to Mars and be capable of carrying 150 tons of cargo aboard. The first timetable for the BFR is 2022, when the tool will carry 150 tons of cargo to Mars. In 2024, the BFR is planned to carry the first crew to the Red Planet, ready to colonize it. Additionally, just like the Falcon 9 rockets, the BFR is going to be entirely reusable.\n \n \n\n \n \n        \n\n        \n    ",  "id": "605"}

Drill the holes and slide the dowels through them and cut them. Remove the clamps and add the glass top.Add touch of color.  If you would just rather use the coat hangers for their intended purpose, then you might want to at least give them a more colorful look. You\u2019ll need wire hangers, yarn, tape and scissors. Tie the yarn right under the curve at the top of the hangers and wrap. Make sure it\u2019s tight. Use tape to keep it secure at the end.Wall books storage. You could also use a coat hanger to make a small storage space for books or other items. You will first have to unfold the hander and then fold it in the desired shape. You can use pliers if you want. It won\u2019t be able to handle large weights so be careful what you store in it. You can also paint the hanger if you want.Oven mitts storage. I don\u2019t know about you but I always have trouble finding a good place to store my oven mitts in the kitchen. I don\u2019t if I should use a hook for each one of them or if I should try to find some other solution. Of course, this should probably help. It\u2019s a great storage system made from a repurposed coat hanger. It has a nice pocket for storing all sorts of items and it\u2019s very useful in the kitchen but also in other spaces as well.In closet. If you don\u2019t have enough space in your closet for all the little accessories like scarves, gloves, etc., then you should definitely use this idea as inspiration. Take a coat hanger and some clothespins and you get a very simple and useful storage system for all your accessories. You can hang it anywhere.Skirt hanger. This used to be a vintage skirt hanger but now it\u2019s an inspirational board. You can make something similar. You need a hanger and some retro clips. It\u2019s great for displaying all sorts of things like cards, photos, memos or notes. It\u2019s something you can make for yourself or as a gift for someone. It\u2019s fun and It\u2019s easy.Wall display. Here\u2019s a similar idea: use an old skirt hanger to make a beautiful wall display. You\u2019ll need lots of clips and a nice-looking hanger. You can display photos and all sorts of little treasures that are nice to look at. Just find a spot for it and enjoy your new decoration. It takes no more than a few minutes to make and you can also improve on the design if you want.Coat rack. This is one of the most ingenious and fun ideas. It\u2019s a coat rack made for a wooden board and a bunch of wooden coat hangers. The hangers have to be cut down and then attached to the board as you see in the picture. The hooks are mobile and you can use them for hanging bags and other accessories while the hanger itself can be used for coats.Entryway holder. Our last project couldn\u2019t be simpler. It\u2019s a DIY upside down hanger. As you can see by yourself, all you have to do is pick a hanger that you like, preferably something simple and sleek, and hang it upside down. It will serve as a nice display piece and storage system for jewelry or small accessories but it can also be just an unusual decoration for the wall.Want more craft ideas?

{"content": "Some women have an easy time getting pregnant. Some women have easy pregnancies. Some women have easy babies. Some women have easy teenagers. No woman I've ever met has had all four. And a Mother's Day card is the perfect place to acknowledge that your mom has made a lot of sacrifices for you. So instead of letting Hallmark do all the heavy lifting, get a card for mom that has some space for penning a personal message, and use these ideas as a jumping-off point. Talk about the time you needed her most, and she was there.Whether it was to cheer you on during a big game or cheer you up after someone broke your heart, devote a few sentences to how her presence boosted you up. And thank her for the support.Say what you most adore about her.Maybe she's got a wicked sense of humor. Maybe she never sweats the small stuff. Maybe she is the most selfless person you've ever encountered. Whatever you love about her, make it known in the card.Every mom has a story about her kids she remembers fondly. Remind her of the one that always makes her laugh. Bonus points if you can add something she didn't realize had also happened.Write about a lesson she taught you.There's probably been a situation when you handled things exactly as your mom would have, especially if you're a parent, yourself. Share the story, and end it with how appreciative you are that she influenced you in such great ways. In your years as someone's child, you've likely regretted doing something that upset or angered your mom. If you've never owned up to it, take the opportunity to do so in the card. It may seem random, but your mother is sure to appreciate the gesture.Tell her what you couldn't have accomplished without her.Every loving mother wants their children to achieve their goals. She's probably helped you reach a few of yours. So call them out, emphasizing how it wouldn't have been possible if not for her. Again, thank her. Profusely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",  "id": "620"}

{"content": "Most people just use clothing and accessories to decorate themselves. But they can also serve as home decorations if displayed in the right way. Here are a few ideas for bringing your personal fashion sense into your home d\u00e9cor.Create an Accessory Wall. Accessories like hats and purses, particularly those you might not wear often, can serve as interesting wall art. Just hang a series of hooks on your wall and hang your hats or handbags from them. This can be particularly decorative if you have any antique hats or purses that you don\u2019t get to show off in person very often.Use Scarves as Art. If you have any decorative scarves with cool colors or patterns, you can use a skirt hanger or two hooks to spread them out flat and display them. From a distance, it can just look like a painting or other piece of art. But you can easily change out your scarves whenever you decide to wear one.Utilize Dress Forms. You can try hanging clothes on a wall hook like you would with the scarves or accessories listed above, but dresses and other clothing don\u2019t hang the same way as these accessories, so they might not look as good as they would on an actual person. But if you use a dress form, which can be found at sewing suppliers or antique stores, you can show off dresses or other clothing in the way they were actually intended to look.Open Up Your Closet. You don\u2019t necessarily have to pull clothing and accessories out of your closet in order to make them into decorations for your home. Instead, you can simply make your closet itself into a display piece. If you don\u2019t have an enclosed closet, you can make do with some clothing racks out in the open that can display all the colors and patterns of your wardrobe. You can use shelves on either side of your racks to hold your shoes and other accessories. Even if you do have an enclosed closet, you can still choose some of your favorite pieces to display out in the open.Display Shoes on Shelves. Shoes can be some of the most difficult accessories to store, so why not just make them into display pieces? Instead of hiding them under your bed or in boxes, put your shoes out on bookcases or other shelves. You can either have a dedicated case for shoes or just mix them in with your books and other items. Displaying your clothing and accessories in your home can not only add your own personal sense of style, but it can also help you store items that might otherwise take up a lot of unnecessary hidden space. Whatever your motives, the tips above can help you ensure that your home will be as well dressed as you are.Want more craft ideas?

{"content": "The Popular Battle Royale game Fortnite Season 4 update is now rolling on the iOS. Earlier, the servers went down, suggesting the end of Season 3, and now, the iOS Season 4 update is live in the App Store.\nEpic Games took to Twitter to announce the server downtime, and the launch of Season 4. The developer also launched a video announcing Season 4. Other than the patches and bug fixes, the developer has introduced new hero types, special rocks giving anti-gravity power and so on with the Fortnite Season 4 update.\n \n\n\u201cShards of a massive comet have crashed into the map altering the landscape. Discover gravity-defying Hop Rocks and find new ways to play. Jump in and witness the aftermath of impact while you level up your Battle Pass and earn all new loot,\u201d read the patch note of Fortnite Season 4.\nFurther, the post says that the comet has left a mark on the island and players would find glowing rocks nearby. The comet, which was visible a few days back before the release of the update, has scattered the glowing rocks all around. \u201cConsume them and lift off with low gravity!\u201d read the patch note. In the Season 4, maps have also been changed along with the iOS players\u2019 ability to drag and drop the inventory items.\nBefore the update, rumors were that the hero theme would be linked to DC in someway, and the design of the characters in Epic\u2019s tweets also backed the idea. However, now when the superheroes have landed, there is no mention of DC.\nEpic has also introduced some bug fixes to up the performance and optimization. However, these fixes are not meant for the players who have the iPhone X. One of the most significant improvements made is \u201clow-end mobile performance by dynamically scaling background draw distances with player height.\u201d\nAlso, the input settings can be filtered based on the game mode. Further, the settings have also been segregated into categories like Combating, Building and Editing to ease the search process. The update also adds the icons for the tabs at the top of the Settings Screen. Epic has also added the \u201cIgnore Gamepad Input\u201d option in the accessibility settings tab to allow players to use external programs and remap their controller input.\nEpic has set a different theme for all its seasons with the second one featuring the Medieval themed skins and cosmetics, whereas Season 3 was about the retro-futuristic styled space age goodness. However, the Fortnite Season 4 theme is still not known, and details would start rolling over as Season 4 is adopted massively. Season 4 has witnessed art releases such as magical headgear and a slew of intense glares. The additions make a lot of sense, clarifying the connection between the meteor and the new super heroes.\nLike the previous seasons, Epic Games is offering Season 4 for free. However, the players will have to buy the optional Battle Pass to avail the cosmetics and rewards. If a player decides to buy the pass later in the season, they would retroactively get the things that they would have brought at the start.\nThe Season 4 Battle Pass costs $10 or 950 V-Bucks (Epic\u2019s in-game currency for Fortnite). The Season 3 Battle Pass also cost the same. The Battle Bundle, which consists of the pass and boost to Rank 25, would cost higher at about 2800 V-Bucks. Further, for $150 you can unlock the Fortnite Battle Royale Season 4 Battle Pass without having to earn it.\n\u201cThe Season 4 Battle Pass is here sporting 100 tiers of awesome new rewards, including new cosmetic items, emotes and Sprays,\u201d the patch note says. The Fortnite Season 4 download size is 209.6MB on the iOS. It would be even bigger on the PC, PS4 and Xbox One.\nPlayers are not only interested in playing the free version, but are also spending money, and this is helping Fortnite to make big money on the iOS. Earlier in April, it was making close to $2 million a day from the iPhone users, according to SensorTower. Spending that kind of money on a video game comes as a surprise because any spending by the players is not helping them to play the mobile game, meaning it does not give them any advantage to win over other players. Players can use the money to purchase outfits, gear and dance moves in the Fortnite. Also, these goods are only cosmetic, not virtual.\n\n \n \n        \n\n        \n    ",  "id": "624"}
{"content": "Many people consider wild animals to be unpredictable and scary, but we are often proven wrong when these kinds of things happen. A hero bear goes into action and saves a drowning crow in this heartwarming rescue at the Budapest Zoo in Hungary. The natural predator can be seen lounging inside his enclosure snacking on apples and carrots when he hears a cry for help. After noticing the bird in danger, the bear reaches into the water, lifts it by its wing, and drops the crow safely on the ground. The spectators watch in awe as the bear then carries on munching on his vegetable snacks, leaving the bird to catch its breath and fly away.Altruism between such distantly-related species is not uncommon. One might think that the bear was actually excited to find something other than carrots and apples in his enclosure, but that is clearly not the case, as the ursine calmly goes back to nom on an apple, after dropping the bird on dry land. The funny thing is that people often forget that all of the animals, including humans, are made of the same cloth. We tend to be grumpy when we\u2019re hungry and we lash out on others, similar to what bears do out in the wild. Surely, if the bear wanted to chew on something meatier, he would have ended that poor crow\u2019s life the minute he caught it in the water.Although as of lately zoos get a bad reputation for keeping animals away from their natural habitat and keeping them under locks, their main goal is to educate people on the billions of different species living in the most remote places on Earth, threatened by extinction by global warming or by the human hand, and luckily, every once in a while, they teach us that we may come in different forms, but we are all alike.",  "id": "625"}

Not to mention the fact that most people seem to have more shoes than anything else in the house \u2026 pair that with the clutter shoes provide and you\u2019ve got a problem on your hands (especially with smaller closets!).

Mail drops could do the same thing. They\u2019re enclosed and concealed from causing clutter!{found on younghouse}.2. Pantries. When the shelves are slated, pantries can become instant shoe closets. Buy mobile pantries and use them specifically for more shoe storage. With this, everything will be much easier to organize and you can shoe off your favorite pumps and sneakers.3. Crates on the wall. Such a great idea for a foyer, garage or back door area. Organize and tidy up your shoes by using crates! On the walls or lined up on the ground, with different colors, crates are an easy way to keep neat with a bit of style too!4. See the shoes.

This makes it easier to find and a bit more contemporary in style.5. Racks on the wall. Put your racks on the wall. It\u2019ll be neat, easy to find and utilizes the space for more shoes! And more clothes in the closet of course.6. Shoe hangers. Talk about a way to utilize space! Grab some old wire hangers and start hanging! Get your shoes off the floor and display them.7. Bookshelves. I\u2019m stealing this idea for myself and wondering why I never thought of it before. Bookshelves don\u2019t take up too much space but they create so much for room for shoes!

Chi Chi was found outside a dog meat farm in South Korea, where she had been strung up by her paws and stuffed with food to prepare her for slaughter. The bindings ate away at her flesh and soon it was only bone that Chi Chi was hanging from. The farmers deemed her meat unworthy and she was disposed of, all four paws rendered useless. But that wasn't the end for Chi Chi. She was found by animal welfare group Nabiya Irion Hope Project, and her story began to spread.Chi Chi underwent a quadruple amputation, and amazed everyone when she was trying to walk just days later.'We weren't even sure she was going to live,' Shannon Keith, the president of Animal Rescue, Media &amp; Education (ARME), told The Dodo. 'She was smiling and wagging her tail. Then, a couple days later, she even started walking on her little stumps.'   As she underwent rehabilitation and began learning how to use prosthetic paws in Seoul, a loving family from Phoenix was following Chi Chi's journey to recovery online.Although they originally only planned to donate money, the Howells soon realized they wanted to be Chi Chi's forever home.  'I think ultimately, as we progressed with her story, we just felt a connection with her,' Richard Howell told the Associated Press. 'Chi Chi is different. She might actually change the world.' ARME flew Chi Chi to Los Angeles, where she was greeted by Keith. The pair then drove her to Phoenix, where the Howells were waiting for the newest addition to their family.They were immediately taken by the joyful and fiery dog, who got the chance to sniff grass for the first time in her life in the Howells front yard. 'She has a will to live,' Megan Howell, the family's daughter, told CBS 5 AZ. 'She just loves people and she's just so happy despite what happened to her in the past.' Chi Chi is now spending her days walking and running around that backyard as she awaits her new prosthetic limbs, and surprising everyone with how little her past holds her back. 'I was sitting on a ledge, and she jumped up on it,' Keith told The Dodo. 'I was like, \"What! This dog is amazing!' The Howells, who have two other rescue dogs, are hoping to make Chi Chi a therapy dog once she completes her rehabilitation. They plan to take her to hospitals to visit soldiers and children who also had to undergo amputations. 'We want to use her story to make the lives of humans better,' Richard Howell told the Associated Press.'I think if we do that, we're doing something positive in the world.' Meat farmers scare dogs because they believe the fear makes them taste better, but Chi Chi's past life has proven to those around her the power of forgiveness - and resilience.'She loves people and she loves being around people despite what she's been through,' Elizabeth Howell said. 'She's happy, she's loving, and we're just so excited to have her be a part of our family.''She has an amazing will to live.' ",  "id": "628"}

With that being said, judges will have to send home two couples every week to find out who will make it out on the top.\nWhile every couple brought out a high-intensity performance, there were two couples that made the best first impression on the judges.\n\nOlympic figure skater Adam Rippon and Jenna Johnson had one of the two highest scoring performances. The duo performed the Cha-Cha to RuPaul\u2019s \u201cSissy That Walk\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m not a scientist, but we\u2019ve got chemistry,\u201d Rippon says when it comes to his and Johnson\u2019s performance. He kept up with Johnson\u2019s footwork and brought the perfect amount of attitude to the dance floor. The couple scored a 24/30 points, however as the season continues we can expect their scores to rise.\nAnother crowd favorite was NFL cornerback Josh Norman and Sharna Burgess\u2019s Cha-cha to \u201cFinesse\u201d by Bruno Mars. Norman admits to having no dance experience prior to the show, however his confidence shined through as he already had his shirt ripped open before the song even started. The judges point out that Norman has the musicality and style that would help him rise to the top. The couple scored 24/30, making them tied for first with Rippon and Johnson.\nAt the end of the show the couples that were in the bottom were: Tonya Harding and Sasha Farber, who performed the Foxtrot to \u201cWhen You Believe\u201d by Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey, Johnny Damon and Emma Slater, who did the Foxtrot to \u201cCenterfield\u201d by John Fogerty and Jamie Anderson and Artem Chigvintsev, who danced the Viennese Waltz to \u201cFeeling Good\u201d by Avicii.

{"content": "With all the recent activity around augmented reality, the possibilities involving immersive computing and commerce are quickly becoming obvious, and digital payments giant PayPal has no plans to sit on the sidelinesThe company has been granted an augmented reality patent, which was filed back in 2016, that details an \"augmented reality view of product instructions.\"Surfaced by financial news site CNBC, the patent offers a fairly broad description of how the AR dynamic would work.\"In a system for presenting augmented reality views of product instructions a method may include receiving a request from a client device, the request including image data,\" reads the patent's description section. \"The method may further includes identifying an object in the image data and generating an augmented reality view of the identified object. The method may further include transmitting the augmented reality view to the client device.\" The patent, which was granted just a few days ago (April 24), also gets specific with regard to which kind of \"client devices\" the AR system would use, mentioning laptops, tablets, and mobile phones in the range of possible use cases.Yet another patent, which was granted in February of this year, offers even more insight into PayPal's plans. The other patent, titled \"using augmented reality for electronic commerce transactions,\" deals with the heart of PayPal's current business model as it evolves in the future.\"Computer program products for identifying objects of interest and providing relevant information about the objects of interest using augmented reality devices.\"\"Systems, methods, and computer program products for identifying objects of interest and providing relevant information about the objects of interest using augmented reality devices are disclosed,\" is how the patent is described. \"For example, a computer-implemented method may include identifying an object of interest among a plurality of objects present in an image view, determining real-time information for the object of interest based on the identifying, presenting the determined real-time information for the object of interest as part of the image view, and processing a transaction involving the object of interest based on a user selection associated with the image view.\"One of the drawings included along with that particular patent depicts a person using a mobile phone or a pair of AR smartglasses to interact with a city bus to determine the route of that bus and the fare necessary to reach the user's destination. Because of these patents, some are speculating that this all means the company may be preparing to launch its own pair of AR smartglassses. But since PayPal, as well as its parent company eBay, aren't generally known for manufacturing hardware, or even software that's not directly related to the company's primary commerce products, this patent update could be more of a strategic, license-based leveraging move to work with companies with a background in producing wearable tech (like Apple), rather than an indication that PayPal is planning to create its own wearable AR product (although, anything is possible).In a world full of AR transactions, licensing various ways to interact with virtual objects and products via mobile devices will be key to the future of AR and mobile commerce in general.So no, don't hold your breath waiting for PayPal AR smartglasses, but you can absolutely expect the company to be at the center of AR-powered transactions in the coming months and years.    \n \n \n \n ",  "id": "640"}

{"content": "Last month, Google stopped supporting domain-fronting technology, thus depriving third-party developers of an effective way to bypass locks, including at the state level. Recall, before making changes to the network architecture, some services used this \"loophole\" to redirect traffic through Google, using the company's network as a proxy. And now it became known that Amazon did exactly the same. The corresponding change in the domain protection policy, which Amazon Web Services announced on April 27, noted the resource The Verge.In Amazon, this step was explained by the fight against unscrupulous developers and the spread of malicious software.\"Tools, including malware, can use this [data transfer] technique between two unrelated domains to prevent restrictions and locks applied at the TLS / SSL level,\" the company said in a statement. \"None of our customers need someone else to impersonate them, using the usual, innocent domain name.\"Previously, using domain fronting techniques, third-party developers could pretend that they are accessing sites from Google or Amazon domains, using the latter as an intermediary node and thus avoiding locks.

(Harry's father married his stepmother Camilla Parker Bowles there in 2005.) Afterwards, there will be two receptions: one, a luncheon hosted by the Queen, at St. George's Hall for the wedding party guests, and an intimate gathering later that evening. By intimate, we mean a private event for 200 family and friends hosted by Prince Harry's father, Prince Charles. Lots of royal hopefuls are wondering what they will see and won't see the day of the wedding. What will the inside of the chapel look like? What about the reception immediately after? Are we even going to see the special touches of Prince Charles' reception? Who is decorating everything? Here, we breakdown what the venues will look like\u2014including our decor predictions and whether or not Markle has a say in the designs.The Ceremony - St. George's ChapelThe wedding ceremony will take place on the grounds of Windsor Castle at St. George's Chapel, which accommodates 800 guests. Here's what it looks like on the inside: It's not the first time the royals have gathered at the chapel. Earlier this month, the royal family attended Easter church service here. They've also held confirmations, weddings, funerals, and other special events at the chapel throughout the years. In a major throwback moment, below, Princess Diana is pictured outside of the chapel at Prince William's confirmation in 1997.

It will, however, be covered with extra flowers and plants. Meghan has chosen florist Philippa Craddock to work on a selection of arrangements for the ceremony.\"Overall, Meghan will have a say in things she likes and dislikes for the wedding,\" says MarieClaire.com's exclusive royal wedding expert Caroline Castigliano. \"However, St. George\u2019s Chapel is steeped in history, so the flowers\u2014which are all supposed to come from the Crown Estate and Windsor Park\u2014will really be the only point of design choice in terms of style and color. It's said that there will be white garden roses, peonies, and foxgloves.\"Prince William and Kate Middleton\u2019s 2011 wedding in Westminster Abbey.\n\n\n\nThe First Reception - St. George's Hall Harry and Meghan will head to St. George's Hall, a 180-feet-long room originally built in the 1800s, following the wedding ceremony. First, they'll take a drive along a route around the castle then they'll make their way to the hall for a luncheon hosted by the Queen. No word yet on whether this reception will be televised.

It's situated half a mile south from Windsor Castle in Berkshire. This sadly definitely won't be televised, extra sadly because it's the part of their big day that Harry and Meghan will likely have the most say in the \"atmosphere\" and \"style\" of, according to Castigliano. She says this reception will be \"of a different nature\" than the rest of the day, and that the bride and groom will go with decor that's \"true to them.\"Alamy\n\n\nPrince Philip, Prince Edward, Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Andrew, Princess Anne, and Prince Charles on the grounds of Frogmore House, Windsor in 1968.\n\n\n\nAnd to get you even more excited for the wedding, this is Prince Harry at 15 years old outside of St. George's Chapel in 1999.

He called the game \"subversive\" and \"evil\". However, it is doubtful that he played exactly in this Scarecrow.2) North Korea: blue jeans.North Korea has decided to ban blue jeans, because this item of clothing of this color is associated with the United States. Okay, let them be black jeans if they please them.3) USA: a surprise cinder.Kinder Surprise is one of the most famous chocolate products around the world. Nevertheless, in the USA it is forbidden, because a small toy inside the product is considered dangerous and can cause strangulation. People who bring them from other countries, even detained at the airport for \"possession\" of danger. The ban was lifted in 2013.4) Singapore: chewing gum.The authorities of Singapore imposed a ban not on the chewing gum itself, but on its sale. The ban came into force in 1992, because someone managed to stop the public transport system with its help. In 2004, the ban was lifted.5) China: time travel.This implies a ban on cinema on television, showing movies on this subject. The Chinese authorities are convinced that presenting travel in time in these formats can lead to a frivolous image of important historical events and facts.6) France: Red Bull.The ban has already been lifted, but until 2008, the energy drink was banned in the country because of fears about taurine, which is part of it. Now the recipe for a drink has changed.7) Iran: male hair tails.In 2010, the Iranian authorities decided to ban all male Western-style haircuts. So if you suddenly catch a horse tail on your head, then be ready to be arrested.8) Denmark: marmite.Marmite is a brown salty paste with a bright taste and a smell, it has added taste to minds. In general, marmite is a by-product of the beer production process. Some people like it, others do not tolerate it. Apparently, Denmark belongs to the second category, as there is a ban on this product in this country. Reason? Most likely, there are too many bad vitamins to eat.9) North Korea: sarcasm.The North Korean regime has banned sarcasm from people in your country, so when you visit this state, be careful with any sarcastic comments.10) Malaysia: yellow clothes.Wearing yellow clothing was banned in Malaysia in 2011, because the government was opposed to a group of activists whose clothes were of the same color when they protested against election laws.",  "id": "657"}

And that kind of just stuck with us. And then I didn\u2019t really like just Storm\u2014I didn\u2019t feel like that was her name. So then it became Stormi. And it just stuck.

{"content": "Lactose intolerance means the body cannot easily digest lactose, a type of natural sugar found in milk and dairy products.This is not the same thing as a food allergy to milk. Lactose intolerance is common in adults.It occurs more often in Native Americans and people of Asian, African, and South American descent than among people of European descent.1. It\u2019s all in the enzymes.Normally, your body produces an enzyme called lactase. When you drink a glass of milk or eat cottage cheese, lactase helps you break down the milk sugar lactose into simpler sugars that are absorbed into your bloodstream. Lactose intolerance occurs when you have a lactase deficiency.2. You should involve your doctor.Some illnesses have stomach symptoms similar to those of lactose intolerance. Your doctor can help you pinpoint the cause of your complaints. He or she may start by asking you to remove all dairy from your diet to see if you feel better. Breath tests or tests of your stool can confirm the diagnosis.3. Not everyone has symptoms.Undigested lactose can produce a wide range of gastrointestinal symptoms within two hours of consuming dairy. These include bloating, nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. However, you can have a lactase deficiency and have no signs at all.4. You usually grow into it.A few babies are lactose intolerant from birth and must drink lactose-free formula instead of breast milk. However, most people who are lactose intolerant lose their ability to digest milk sometime after infancy. Usually, this occurs between ages 2 and 12, though you may not experience symptoms until late adolescence or adulthood.5. You\u2019re not alone.As many as 65 percent of people worldwide, and 30 million Americans, have some degree of lactose intolerance. It\u2019s more common if your background is Asian, African, Hispanic, or Native American, and less likely if your ancestors are from northern or western Europe.6. It\u2019s not an allergy.Milk allergy is less common but more harmful than lactose intolerance. If you\u2019re allergic to milk, your body fights dairy as if it were a harmful invader. Symptoms are typically more severe and can include wheezing, itchy eyes, and rash. People with this allergy must avoid milk products entirely.7. Not all dairy is off limits.Unlike those with allergies, most people with lactose intolerance can drink up to a half-cup of milk with no symptoms. Other dairy products have lower levels of lactose and may be even easier to digest. These include hard or aged cheeses and yogurt.8. Lactose appears in surprising places.Milk and milk products are added to a wide variety of processed foods. For instance, baked goods, cereals, and candies can all contain lactose. Check labels for the words whey, curds, and dry milk solids, and avoid these products if they aggravate your stomach.9. Dietary changes can relieve symptoms.Start with small doses of dairy and see if you can increase your intake over time. Lactose-free and reduced-lactose milk are increasingly available, as are soy milk and other milk substitutes. Finally, taking over-the-counter lactase drops or tablets can help you digest dairy.10. Calcium is still key.Because dairy products are a major source of bone-strengthening calcium and vitamin D, lactose intolerance may increase your risk for thin bones. Eat other sources of calcium and vitamin D, including leafy greens, egg yolks, and fortified juices. And ask your doctor if you should take supplements.",  "id": "660"}

Notably, games such as the upcoming Call of Duty and Battlefield are reported to possibly have their own Battle Royale modes.\nAlso according to the report: Console revenues are going to reach $33.2 billion by 2022.\nWhat\u2019s your opinion of lootboxes? Do you think they\u2019re harmless purchases or do you think that they shouldn\u2019t be part of modern gaming?\nSOURCE\n\n",  "id": "666"}

According to Marcus, over 8 billion messages have been sent between people and businesses. And there are 300,000 monthly active bots engaging with customers on messenger.\nFacebook introduced messenger bots for businesses at F8 in 2016. The idea is that bots allow for automated communication between businesses and customers, helping with issues like product recommendations and customer service. According to Marcus, that 300,000 number grew from just 100,000 monthly active bots in its first year.\nDavid Marcus' Messenger updates struck an odd tone in comparison with the rest of F8. In his keynote, Mark Zuckerberg emphasized that he wants Facebook to be a \"people first\" platform. \n\"When I look out today it still surprises me how little of our technology is designed to put people first,\" Zuckerberg said. \"I believe that we need to design technology to help bring people closer together.\"\n\"People first\" messaging pervaded the rest of F8, with Instagram, WhatsApp, and other product updates stressing how Facebook is helping to enrich interpersonal relationships.

{"content": "Love has brought lots of pains into the lives of young people more especially because of the wrong choice of a life partner. Pains as a result of dating at the wrong time of their life. Love leaves memories that no can steal, imagine if the memory is a painful one?When you have all what it takes to travel and the destination is also decided, it makes such a journey a much easier one. However if you are not ready but want to embark on such journey, and have to rely on someone to embark on the journey, it becomes a dangerous and difficult one. It becomes even worse when that person is neither ready nor real.Waiting becomes painful and if in the end you fail to embark on the journey because you were disappointed, it becomes painful to forget such a person. But the worst pain is when you don't know if you should wait or forget, If you should move on or hold on.If only our eyes could see the mind of people, many people would apply the breaks when it comes to falling in love, but unfortunately it isn\u2019t so. This is why one is required to be ready before embarking on such a journey.In life everything runs on the back of priorities and if you don't learn how to stand on your own feet, you will always beg for a shoulder to lean on. It is therefore required of every individual going into marriage to be ready. Turn your dreams into plans; get to know the priorities of anyone who asks for your hand in love, dating or marriage.If they can't make you a priority in their lives, there is no need making room for them. If they are not ready to be with you then stop making yourself available for them. It is as simple as that.You don't need to start such journey as the mate or conductor, if you do, you might lose your seat. You need to be in the front seat. You need to sit next to anyone who wants you as a spouse and not behind with someone else beside them; not even if they beg you to stay behind and promise that the one beside them will get off along the way.The truth is, if you start off as the other man or woman, you will never be the only man or woman in their lives. You will end up alone. Before you call them your lover, be sure they have made you one. Don't live on dreams. This life is reality.How do you know you are not their priorities? It is when they make you last, when replies get slower, when conversations get shorter, when you are blamed or accused.If you want your current or next relationship to be the last one, then stop rushing, stop worrying, stop looking, stop wanting. Let love find you, let them learn about you, let them need you.

And we're worried about the second round now that we're here.\"James was magnificent against the Pacers, averaging 34.4 points on 55.3 percent shooting from the field (35.3 percent from 3) and 81.8 percent from the foul line, to go with 10.1 rebounds, 7.7 assists, 1.4 steals and 1.0 block per game.He was not interested in rehashing his individual success in the first round, however.\"It's about what we did,\" James said. \"Just trying to help us advance. I had a lot of things that I had to do to try to help our team win, and I was satisfied with the fact that I was able to go out and make plays to help our team succeed and move onto the next round, and that's the most important thing.\"The Cavs lost 133-99 on the last occasion they played in Toronto, on Jan. 11. That was before they revamped their roster at the trade deadline. After their moves, they beat the Raptors twice -- 132-129 on March 21 and 112-106 on April 3 -- to take the season series 2-1.Cleveland also beat Toronto in the postseason the past two years -- six games in the 2016 conference finals and a four-game sweep in the 2017 semifinals -- but James doesn't think there is much of a comparison there.\"I don't know about previous years and things of that nature,\" James said. \"I worry about this present Raptors team that we're facing, and they're the No. 1 team in the East for a reason. They are well-balanced. The head of the snake is DeMar [DeRozan] and Kyle [Lowry], but they've added some pieces this year that has helped this team be more complete. And obviously their bench is extremely well-balanced. They come in and play with the same aggression and the same focus and the same confidence as the first unit.\"So they're a more well-balanced team this year, and they showed it in their record, they showed it in their ability to win games and they showed why they're the No. 1 team in the East. So I don't know, I'm not comparing. Let's just talk about this year.\"The Raptors' bench of Delon Wright, CJ Miles, Pascal Siakam and Jakob Poeltl combined to average 32.5 points per game against the Washington Wizards in the first round. And that does not include Fred VanVleet, maybe Toronto's most dynamic threat in the second unit, who missed most of the series with a shoulder injury.\"Their second unit is a big part of what they do,\" Lue said. \"They come up with a lot of energy, they score the basketball, they defend well. So we got to just be able to come out and just hold that second unit down as best as we can.\"Although James was not willing to look back on past matchups with Toronto, DeRozan was.\"They stopped us from getting to our goal [all] these years,\" DeRozan said. \"If you're not frustrated with that and that don't bring the extra energy from within us ... I know for a fact our crowd is definitely going to be in it and have that same energy. For sure, if that's what it takes for us to get past it, by calling it a rivalry, why not?\"",  "id": "689"}

We love our kids and sacrifice so much for them, that comments like these cut to the core. Following are some ideas on how to handle your child or teens mean or critical comments. The great thing about this topic is that you can apply it to anyone\u2019s hurtful comments.TeenagersI\u2019m focusing on children\u2019s or teens comments because those take a little more understanding. Often children and adults alike will feel hurt and frustrations, and hold these feelings in until there is so much built up that they come spewing out. When this happens the intensity of the comments as well as the strength of the words will be excessive. This applies to us parents as well -- we all can say forceful words when angry, frustrated, or afraid.Realize it is normal for you to feel hurt, shocked, angry and confused when receiving a mean comment. So, if you have this reaction you are very, very normal. As a parent and an adult, it is up to us to stay the grown up and not respond back in pain in a similar manner.One caveat to the tips I\u2019m sharing is that you do not need to listen to abusive talk toward you. For instance, it is OK but hard to hear you child say they are mad at you, frustrated with you, irritated by you, etc. You do not have to listen if your child or teen curses at you, calls you names, or is trashing you. If this occurs, I would say, \u201cI can tell you are in a lot of pain, and you have a lot to say. I will not allow myself to be sworn at or called names. How about if we both calm down and try again in an hour. I\u2019d like to hear specifically what you are upset about and how you are feeling. I\u2019m going out for a walk. I\u2019ll be back in an hour, and we can try again.\u201d Likewise, if you find yourself yelling or name calling, or making sweeping statements such as \u201cyou always\u201d or \u201cyou never\u201d, you need to take a break until you\u2019ve calmed down.Following are a few tips to help you turn negative comments from a painful experience to one that actually deepens and strengthens your relationship with your child or teen. The goal is to understand your child or teen better, increase the emotional safety in your relationship by being a safe person while he/she shares feelings, and repair whatever real or perceived hurt has occurred. You can actually come out closer than when you started.1. Listen \u2013 Listen to what they are saying \u2013 Try to listen all the way through. As normal as it is to interrupt, interject and respond back immediately, it will short circuit the interaction, and you won\u2019t be able to make headway with your child or teen.2. Open your heart and mind \u2013 Try not to be defensive. This isn\u2019t about defending yourself -- this is about hearing your child /teen, letting them know you take their pain seriously, and will work with them to come up with a solution.3. What is he/she trying to say? \u2013 As you listen, ask yourself what is her main complaint? What feelings is he/she having? If you had to boil down his/her thoughts and feelings into one or two sentences, what would it be?4. What is the pain he/she is trying to express? Is she feeling ignored, not considered, that something is unfair, that he\u2019s been harmed in some way, that he/she isn\u2019t getting enough attention or listening time, etc? Try to boil it down so that you can understand it better.5. What is he/she saying is missing? This is always a good thing to listen for -- is it time, love, affection, fairness, being understood, appropriate freedom, hanging out time, encouragement?6. What does she need? A good question to ask is \u201cIf I could wave a magic wand and fix what you are dealing with, what would happen?\u201d The answers may surprise you. Kids and teens do not just know these answers -- they figure them out as you ask them good questions. Sometimes it is that something needs to happen, or that something distressing needs to stop.7. What do you need? What do you need in this situation? Is it affirmation from another adult that there is hope, that you are doing a good job, or that you need a break or practical help with parenting? Check in with yourself. If your needs are not met to a minimal amount, you won\u2019t be able to be there for your child or teen. Our emotional needs should not be filled by our kids. They need to be who they are, going through what they are going through. It is not up to them to make us feel OK, adequate, or good enough. These are normal needs that every parent has -- they just need to be met by other adults, not by your kids.8. Work with yourself on what they\u2019ve shared. Ask yourself -- is there a kernel of truth in what my child or teen has shared? What could I do to help my child in this situation? Please know that just by listening in an empathetic and validating way you are already doing a lot!9. What can you say to yourself that\u2019s an encouragement? Maybe things like \u201dI am a good parent even if I\u2019m not perfect. I can give myself the gift of listening to my child/teen and build the relationship. I can repair the relationship, if needed. All the love and effort I\u2019ve given my child/teen will pay off -- it is deep inside them, and none of it goes to waste\u201d. Add your own statements to this list.10. What is one concrete thing you could do to consider and respond to your child\u2019s complaint? Write out possibilities, even if small. Even though it may seem like one more thing that you now have to do you don\u2019t have time for, it will be worth the effort. Remember a happy child/teen is much easier to deal with than one who is tied up inside with pain and frustration.11. Is there anything you need to apologize for? Remember that most of the things kids feel hurt or frustrated by are unintentional, and sometimes are distortions on their part. Even if this is true the emotional hurt needs to be repaired.Remember you don\u2019t need to figure out all this in the spur of the moment. That would be almost impossible to do. It\u2019s fine to summarize to your teen what you\u2019ve heard him/her share (thoughts/feelings/main complaint), and then say \"I really want to think about how to respond to this -- because what you have shared is really important to me. I\u2019ll think some more about it and I\u2019d like you to as well. Let\u2019s talk more about it tomorrow.\"  This will then give you time to think it all through, pray about it, and get support from a friend. Make sure you bring it up with your child/teen the next day -- otherwise this will really hurt.Remember to thank them for taking the risk to share their tender thoughts and feelings with you. It is a huge gift to you to have them open up and show you their hurts and feelings. Even though it is hard to hear, the alternative of them handling these feelings and frustrations on their ownScience Articles, then acting them out with disturbing behavior is a pretty bad option -- for you and for them!I sure hope this helped. You are amazing to want to learn how to help your children and teens when they are hurt and frustrated.",  "id": "691"}

{"content": "Before bringing a furry kitten home, it's worth understanding that an animal is not only a joy but also a great responsibility. You have to learn everyday care. A favorite has to have its own corner and a balanced diet.FoodPet stores have a huge assortment of feed. But do not necessarily feed your pet with factory feed. You can give him a natural meal in the form of boiled meat and fish, some vegetables, sour-milk products, cereals. If you have already decided to feed the kitten with prepared feeds, it should take into account a number of factors: age, breed, illness, sterilization, etc.VitaminsCats that live permanently in an apartment should additionally receive vitamins in the form of supplements for food and pills. Plant a special grass for cats on the windowsill, so that your pet can have a rest from time to time, and your indoor plants will remain intact.Visit to the veterinarianEvery review of a pet's doctor is a kind of prevention of all kinds of diseases. Especially since early diagnosis is a guarantee of successful treatment and rapid recovery of the animal.If you plan to travel the country and want to take a kitten with you, then vaccination from rabies is necessary for him, because without this vaccination the animal may not be allowed to another area.Cooking time in your cribYou can put a pet in his basket. However, making him sleep all night is unlikely to succeed. Most sailors fit comfortably on the beds of their masters. Interestingly, cats usually go to sleep to those most loved.If you do not want to share your bed with a tailing friend, then you can accustom a cat to sleep separately. Take the pet to the room in which he has to sleep. Turn off the light and close the door. Pre-leave in the \"cat room\" a toilet and a bowl of water.Most likely, your first night your cat will protest. So get ready for a mournful cry. In order for a cat to get used to sleeping himself, it will have to wait a week or two.Good luck with you and your four-legged friends!",  "id": "693"}
{"content": "1. Soda Machines Are Difficult To CleanMany fast food restaurants will give you a cup after you place your order so that you can go to the soda machine, fill your cup with ice, choose your favorite flavor, and fill your cup. The next time you pour your soda, you might want to look into the ice dispenser. Because this part of the soda dispenser is practically impossible to clean, you will likely see mold inside. The dispenser isn\u2019t moldy because the employees are lazy, it is just really hard to clean.2. Your Chicken McNuggets Aren\u2019t FreshIf you ever go to McDonald\u2019s to order Chicken McNuggets, you should understand that they are not as fresh as you would like them to be. The McNuggets sit in a warming tray, waiting for someone to order them. After they come out of the fryer, a timer is set. If the McNuggets haven\u2019t been bought by then, they are thrown away and a new batch is made. According to many McDonald\u2019s employees, the McNuggets in the warming try aren\u2019t thrown away. They just reset the timer.3. The Meat In Wendy\u2019s Chili Has Been Re-PurposedWhen burgers are sitting too long on the grill at Wendy\u2019s they aren\u2019t served to customers. Not as burgers at least. The old burgers are placed in a bin and they are put in the refrigerator. When it is time to make the chili, the employees boil the burgers, they chop them up, and they put them into the chili. It may sound strange, but it is actually very practical. They are able to avoid wasting food and money.4. Get Two Big Macs For the Price Of OneIf you go to McDonald\u2019s for a Big Mac, you can get two for the price of one. Well, sort of. The McDouble is the same as a Big Mac, except it is smaller and instead of lettuce and Mac sauce, it has mustard and ketchup. Since McDoubles cost just $1 or $2, you can make a couple of substitutes and you can get two Big Macs. Since Burger King isn\u2019t the only fast food chain who will, \u201cdo it your way\u201d, you can ask to have a few substitutions made to your McDouble. If you ask them to leave out the mustard and ketchup and have them replace it with the lettuce and the Mac sauce, you will get two smaller Big Macs for the price of one.5. The Grill Marks Aren\u2019t RealThis is one of the most upsetting secrets fast food companies don\u2019t want you to know. If you look at your burger or your chicken from a fast food restaurant, you will see grill marks. Unfortunately, the grill marks aren\u2019t real. Fast food restaurants don\u2019t even cook their burgers and chicken on an open flame, therefore, the grill marks are fake. They are actually put on the burgers and chicken with food coloring before the food even arrives at the restaurant.6. You Can Get Fresh FriesSince fries are sold so often, the fries are usually fresh. However, if you want the freshest fries possible, you can order yours with no salt. If you do, the employees will need to make you a fresh batch. This might annoy the employees, but you will get a fresh serving of fries.7. The Salads Aren\u2019t As Healthy As You ThinkMany people order salads from fast food restaurants because they are healthy and low in calories. What you may not know is that this is not true. Between all of the cheese on the salad, the fried chicken, and the loads of dressing they give you, you can expect your salad to be 700 calories or more.8. The McCafe Machines Are FilthyThere are many people who prefer a McCafe coffee over a Dunkin Donuts coffee or a Starbucks coffee. If you are one of these people, you might change your mind when you find out how dirty most of the machines are. The McCafe machines are very hard to clean and sanitize, therefore, you can\u2019t expect to have the cleanest cup of coffee.9. Taco Bell BeansTaco Bell doesn\u2019t get their refried beans in a can already made like you find them in a supermarket. They get their beans as small, dehydrated chunks that look like Cocoa Pebbles.10. Burger King burgers Contain Horse MeatFor years, there have been stories going around the Burger King burgers contain horse meat. There have even been stories that Burger King admitted to putting horse meat in their burgers. Luckily for Burger King lovers everywhere, Snopes, a website who works hard to debunk rumors have proven this rumor to be false. The next time your order a burger from Burger King, you can be sure that you are not eating horse meat,",  "id": "694"}

But today, we\u2019re going to reveal some ways you can boost your HDL cholesterol levels in order to obtain more of the good cholesterol, so it can remove LDL cholesterol and in turn, reduce your risk of cardiovascular-related disease.HDL cholesterol is affected by many different things including genetics, diet, and other lifestyle habits. Although you can\u2019t change your genetics, you can stick to a healthy lifestyle to naturally boost your good cholesterol, and here\u2019s how.\n\nTips to Boost Your HDL Cholesterol\nStop smoking: Studies have shown that smoking not only increases your risk of heart disease but can lower HDL levels.\nExercise: Exercise has been proven to boost HDL levels along with reducing weight, which is another factor in improving your HDL levels. Obesity is associated with high LDL cholesterol and low HDL cholesterol.\nEat healthier: Diet is a major player in cholesterol levels, as some foods can increase LDL cholesterol while others lower HDL cholesterol. The main foods that contribute to high LDL cholesterol are white bread, sugar, some margarine, fried foods, and processed foods. Although some fats contribute to high cholesterol, other fats are good for you and can be found in olive oil, avocados, nuts, and fatty fish. These types of fats can increase HDL cholesterol, which means there\u2019s more of it to remove LDL cholesterol.\nCholesterol levels play a large role in the health of your heart and ensuring that you have more HDL cholesterol compared to LDL cholesterol can help protect your heart for years to come.\n",  "id": "700"}

{"content": "1. Turn Water To Ice As It PoursThis is a great trick and it is very simple to do. It will amaze your friends because they will think that you have the power to turn water into ice in seconds. As long as you prepare and perform the trick correctly, that is exactly what you will be able to do. Start by putting a bottle of water in the freezer and leave it there until it is just about to freeze. Next, put some ice in a bowl. When you pour the water over the ice, it will cool up enough where it will freeze on contact. If you are going to perform this trick, don\u2019t let your audience see you taking the bottle of water from the freezer. It could completely give you up. As long as you are quick and if you plan ahead, you should be able to amaze your friends with this trick.2. The Gravity TrickMost people know that things can go down on their own, but there needs to be some type of force for things to rise. This trick will make your audience believe that you are capable of defying gravity. All you need to pull the trick off is a broken elastic and a ring. Make sure that you don\u2019t let your audience touch the elastic because you want them to think that it is a piece of string. When you get the ring around the elastic, pull the rubber band making it longer. The ring won\u2019t actually go up on its own, however, it will look like it is thanks to the elastic.3. Puncture a Bag Of Water Without Spilling a DropThis is a magic trick that amazes people, both young and old. This actually isn\u2019t a magic trick, it is science. When you put the pencil through the bag, the molecules in the bag will create a seal around the pencil. Just make sure if you are going to be attempting this trick that the pencil is sharpened as much as possible. If you use a dull pencil, it will tear the bag rather than puncture a hole in it. The molecules in the bag aren\u2019t strong enough to close up a tear securely.4. Pass The Coin Through the TableThis is one of the 5 amazing magic trick to amaze your friends. This magic trick amazes most, and it is all done on sleight of hand. For this trick to work, you need to keep your audience from discovering that you don\u2019t have the coin in your left hand. It will actually be in your right hand. You can show your audience the coin, and then quickly switch it to the other hand. Next, pretend that the coin in in your hand and pound your hand down on the table. Next, make a big deal about taking your hand out from under the table with the coin in it. Your audience truly will believe that you were able to pass the coin through the table thanks to your magical powers.5. The Floating Coffee CupIf you can make your friends think that you have the magical powers necessary to keep a cup floating in the air, they will be extremely impressed. This is one of those tricks that have to be done from the right angle if it is going to work. The best type of cup to use is a Styrofoam cup because they are so light and it is very easy to pop a hole in one. All you need to do to pull this trick off is to stick the thumb of your right hand through the cup in the back. When your thumb is in the cup, your audience will think that it is floating in the air. To make the trick more real, move your hands up and down like you are using your magical powers to keep it in the air.Bonus Trick: The Separating Pepper TrickIn this trick, you will make people believe that you have enough magical powers in your finger to separate the pepper when it is poured in water. Before you start the trick, rub some liquid soap on your finger. Next, take a cup of water and pour some pepper in. Let your audience stick their finger in the pepper to separate it. Unfortunately for them, they won\u2019t be able to do it. When your audience member is done trying to separate the pepper, it is your turn. Since you prepared ahead of time by dipping your finger in liquid soap, the pepper will separate quickly and easily. This is a great trick for kids because it is very simple to do and it will amaze their audience.",  "id": "704"}

Her singles, \u201cQueen of New York\u201d and \u201cReviews,\u201d set the stage for listeners,  them a sneak peak into what her new album is all about.\n \nThough she is always working on new music, the album, Tancred shared, came cohesively together during a surprise encounter with herself. She has stated that she spent so much time working on getting to know herself and reach a firm level of comfort of who she is. In doing so, however, she learned that she lost comfort in connecting with other people, and longed to reshape what that kind of connection meant to her. This album is a journey of self discovery, followed by the realization of what she needs in relationship to others, and finding how the two meld together.\n \nTancred as a Powerfully Relatable Artist\n \nWith both the song and the accompanying video, \u201cQueen of New York\u201d does a good job setting the stage of what it is like being young in a big city, encompassing a night life full of falling for a person or even a feeling, with the excitement and confusion all wrapped up into picturesque lyrics and a light tune. The video works well, as the positive, energetic sound contrasts with the more serious black and white imagery, which speaks to both the happy and melancholic vibes that comprise Tancred\u2019s music.\nIn these singles, Tancred takes listeners on a very raw journey and goes deeper into parts of herself that she gave us glimpses of in her past work.

Then Rich did not know that thousands of people would follow their journeys one day.It all started in 2014, when Rich decided to change his life. He worked for 10 years in the business sphere, but this did not bring him happiness. Rich began to sell all his things, including housing, and gradually equipping the van, turning it into a house on wheels.But although Rich was ready for a new stage in life and was waiting for him with impatience, with something he never could say goodbye. Or rather, with someone - his cat Willow, which he took from the orphanage two years earlier.He decided to gradually take her out to nature to see how the cat will react to the changes. First Rich and Willow left for a couple of days, and then for a week, and his pet was a real adventurer, just like her master.In May 2015, the duo went on a trip to Australia. For 2 years they traveled it along and across, but their wanderings did not end there. Both of them liked their new life.In his blog, Rich shares not only the stories from life, but also useful tips. For example, tells in detail how to travel around Australia with pets, and shares estimates of the cost of a nomadic life. For example, Rich himself spends about $ 720 a month. Though the amount is not large, the traveler stresses that it is necessary to have an untouchable fund in case of emergency situations.To make money on the trip, Rich worked part-time at the bar, wrote programs, sold magazines to photos and articles, and also sold things in the online store with things he had done himself. He also worked as a volunteer, which he advises other travelers, because many organizations provide volunteers with free food and shelter.During his trips, Rich and Willow visited many beautiful places (and made Willow not one stunning portrait). And also the pilgrims help shelters for animals and even opened their store, where they sell cards and souvenirs.This is just one of many stories about how one solution can lead to dramatic changes. But her characters are happy - as Rich says, the van has turned into their home, where the backyard is all of Australia.Maybe we should give up the desire to have everything in the world? After all, judging by Rich and his fluffy pet, for happiness really it is necessary very little.",  "id": "712"}

The game developer has made a few big changes [VIDEO] for the new season, yet some of them have gone unnoticed.Most players are busy exploring the new-look map or checking out new Battle Pass rewards, so they haven't noticed some gameplay changes. Epic Games has changed a few things in this patch as well, and another weapon has been moved to the Vault.In case you haven't noticed it yet, a Crossbow is no longer in the game.Another weapon moved to the VaultIt is not a secret that a Crossbow wasn't a popular weapon. While it was unique as it allowed players to snipe their enemies silently, it underperformed in comparison to the other long-range weapons. The game developer added a Hunting Rifle a few months ago, which made a Crossbow even less popular.Additionally, there are two other suppressed weapons in the game, and both of them have been recently added to the game. It is unknown whether or not Epic Games are planning to bring the vaulted weapon back, but considering that the change was announced only in patch notes, it is not likely that the weapon will be brought back.More items moving to the Vault?Just recently, \"Fortnite Battle Royale\" developer moved a Guided Missile to the Vault.Many players considered this explosive weapon overpowered, and that is why Epic Games removed it from the game. Before the missile, Smoke Grenades and a Submachine Gun had been removed, and players are now expecting even more weapons to be moved to the Vault.Considering that a Hand Cannon and a Revolver are very similar to each other, it won't be surprising if the game developer removes the latter from the game. Minigun could also be removed after the development team added a Light Machine Gun to the game.All Credit goes to the Author \"Asmir Pekmic\"",  "id": "714"}

In 2016-17, the taxman collected about HK$290 billion, down from the HK$291 billion for 2015-16, and about HK$302 billion in 2014-15.\nOf the total collected, 42 per cent, or HK$139 billion, was from profits tax, while salaries tax accounted for about HK$60.8 billion.\nRevenue from stamp duty, which is charged on property transactions and share trading, grew by HK$33.3 billion from 2016-17 to HK$95.2 billion. Of that amount, some HK$57.4 billion came from property transactions.\nSales in 2017-18 went up by about 30 per cent to 55,000 transactions.\nBusiness registration fees amounted to HK$2.73 billion, almost 12 times the figure for 2016-17, mainly because of the expiry of the government\u2019s one-year waiver of the fees.\nCommissioner of Inland Revenue Wong Kuen-fai forecast total tax takings in 2018-19 of HK$342.3 billion, a 4 per cent year-on-year increase, despite an estimated 10 per cent drop in salaries tax.\n\u201cWith the new tax allowances and concessions announced in the budget, we expect the revenues from income tax will fall a bit. Our estimate is HK$54.8 billion for 2018-19,\u201d Wong said.\nWong declined to speculate on the outlook of the property and stock markets but, according to his department\u2019s estimates, stamp duty revenue for 2018-19 will rise 5 per cent to about HK$100 billion, accounting for about 30 per cent of the total collected for 2018-19.\nAnd property tax is expected to go up by 4 per cent, to HK$3.6 billion.\nFinancial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po proposed a series of tax concessions in his budget in February, including one-off rebates of salary and profits taxes of 75 per cent. He also suggested widening and increasing the number of salary tax bands, as well as higher allowances for children and dependent parents and grandparents.\nTo honour the election pledge of Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, Chan also announced a two-tier profits tax rates regime in his budget, under which the rate for the first HK$2 million of earnings would be lowered to 8.25 per cent, compared with the current 16.5 per cent, while profits above that level would continue to be 16.5 per cent.\nWong expected corporations to benefit from the robust economy, and corporate tax revenue for 2018-19 was forecast to go up by 12 per cent to HK$155.1 billion.\nBaptist University economist Dr Billy Mak Sui-choi, who is also the associate director of the institution\u2019s centre for corporate governance and financial policy, said the account of the revenue collections presented by the tax department showed Hong Kong\u2019s tax base was too narrow.\n\u201cWith the government having record tax revenue and surplus, it should be time to think about widening the tax base, like introducing a sales tax,\u201d said Mak, who was quick to add: \u201cIt is of course more a political issue than an economic issue.\u201d\nMak also said the tax department might be too optimistic about the economic outlook, given the expected US interest rate increases, and the looming trade friction between China and the US.\n\u201cA rise in bank interest rates could cool property and stock markets, and a trade war could affect corporates\u2019 profits,\u201d he said. \nMeanwhile, the tax chief also asked the city\u2019s 2.6 million taxpayers to look out for the \u201cgreen envelopes\u201d in the next couple of days.

{"content": "In this world of massive smartphones and finger gymnastics, having the address bar in Google Chrome at the bottom of your screen can reduce finger strain without impacting any functionality in your day-to-day browsing experience. Still, enabling this feature is hidden behind an experimental part of Chrome called flags.The chrome://flags menu lets you play around with a bunch of cool experimental settings, but you get so many more options on Android than on its iOS counterpart. Among these settings is the ability to move your address bar, or omnibox, to the bottom of your screen, provided you're on the version 65 of Chrome or earlier. If you're on version 66 of Chrome, then you can enable a similar feature.\n\nEnabling the Bottom Address Bar in ChromeAgain, this is only possible if you're on Chrome 65 or earlier. If you're unsure what version of Chrome you're on, then open up the browser, tap the vertical ellipsis in the top-right corner, and hit \"Settings.\" Scroll to the bottom, and tap \"About Chrome.\" The first two numbers under Application version are the most important ones here. Note that you can also see the version number in Step 1 below.For example, in the screenshots below, you can see that I'm on Chrome 66. If you want to revert to a previous version of Chrome, just search for a Google Chrome that's version 65 or lower on APKPure or another APK hosting site, then install it. (You may need to enable \"Unknown sources\" if you haven't before.) Step 1: Open the Chrome Flags MenuThe flags area contains well over a hundred different experimental features. To get there, open the Google Chrome app, and type chrome://flags into the address bar. As you'll notice, the Chrome version number is also listed next to the Experiments heading. If it doesn't say 66.X, then this won't work. Step 2: Change the 'Chrome Home' SettingNext, navigate down to the setting that reads \"Chrome Home\" or just type it out in the Search flags field up top to have it jump right up to the top of the list. Once you've found the setting, tap on \"Default,\" then choose \"Enabled\" on the popup.Afterward, tap on the \"Relaunch Now\" box to relaunch the app, but you're done yet \u2014 you'll need to open up your app switcher, close the app, then open it back up since it takes two restarts to have the change take affect. Once Chrome starts back up, your address bar, aka omnibox, will be along the bottom of the screen instead of the top along with your tabs icon and ellipsis menu icon. You can even swipe up on the address bar to see a list of your frequently visited sites and news whenever you want. Overall, it's a simple little tweak, but your hands will probably thank you now that they don't have to stretch all the way up to the top of your screen to type in a website name or perform a search. However, if Chrome ever gets updated to version 66 or higher, your URL bar will go right back up to the top like it was before, so keep that in mind if you have automatic updates enabled for Google Play.\n\nEnabling the 'Chrome Duplex\" Flag in New Chrome VersionsIf you're on version 66 of Chrome or have been updated to it and don't want to downgrade with an APK version manually, you can try out the new \"Chrome Duplex\" flag instead, which has replaced the \"Chrome Home\" flag.It's not the same as \"Chrome Home,\" however, since the URL bar still remains at the top. The only difference is that a bar gets added to the bottom of the screen that you can swipe up to view your frequently visited sites and news. Hopefully, Google brings back the bottom omnibox option in the flags menu in a future update, since the \"Duplex\" option doesn't make finger gymnastics any easier, especially on taller phones like a Samsung Galaxy S8 or s9.",  "id": "719"}

{"content": "At any stage of life, but especially when it is growing, your dog needs a good dose of calcium. This way your bone health will be strong until old age. The daily diet of the animal must include the adequate amount of this nutrient for a healthy development. There are some factors that indicate that your hairy needs calcium. Do you want to know which? Then keep reading this article.Calcium in dogs: what to knowFirst of all it is necessary to take into account that calcium is one of the most important nutrients in the life of a dog since it is a puppy because it helps in the formation and strengthening of bones. If we want our pet to grow healthy and strong it is vital that we ingest a good dose of this component through food.food changesWhether the dog consumes a \"homemade\" diet or a diet based on commercial feed, whether or not it should have calcium daily. If this does not happen, it is likely to suffer various problems such as leg fractures. The lack of this nutrient can trigger pathologies such as rickets, a condition in which the growth is insufficient and the bone structure is less than that of other dogs at their age.A puppy dog \u200b\u200bneeds about 320 mg of calcium per kg of weight per day. In the case of adults, the amount decreases to 120 mg per kg. Keep this information in mind so that it is not exceeded in proportion (something that is also bad for your health).How to detect the lack of calcium in dogs?There are different ways to realize that our pet is missing calcium or does not receive it in correct amounts according to their age and weight. Observing the body is the best way to detect it.For example, if you do not grow enough in relation to other dogs (siblings are an ideal indicator), if you are too thin but eat well and if you mark the bones through the skin and these are very thin.In addition, we can determine if you suffer from muscle spasms or seizures. Attention because in these cases the causes may be other (more serious), therefore we recommend that you go to the veterinarian to do a general check.Dogs that lack calcium may experience other symptoms, including tachycardia, disorientation, fatigue, or cardiac arrhythmias. Also here we advise you to take it to the professional consultation.Sources of calcium for dogsThe doctor can tell you to offer a different feed or even add special supplements to the food. This is very good but not the only option. There are \"homemade\" sources of calcium at your fingertips and that your dog will do more than good.puppy, a new friendThe egg shell finely ground (for example in a mortar or coffee grinder) and mixed with the daily food can be an excellent idea if your pet suffers from calcium deficit.The bones of other animals (which are bought in butcher shops such as chicken) can also be very useful. Some owners offer them to eat whole and others prefer that they are chopped or dusted to mix between the feed.Dairy products are a great source of calcium (we know that for humans) and some can help our hairy people improve their health. For example, yogurt, which allows to soften dry food and is very rich for your palates. It is better to be low in fat. Cheese is another option, we recommend the cottage type and not give too much.If you accept it, give your dog fish to increase its calcium levels. Tuna, sardines and trout are the best. But beware, it is cooked because otherwise it can irritate your stomach and cause bacterial diseases.Finally, if your dog is a lover of vegetables or is used to eating without problems, do not hesitate to offer spinach, broccoli and sweet potato",  "id": "722"}

Holocaust, Jews, Slavery is blacks. Prison is something that unites us as one race. Blacks and whites being one race.\u201d\n\"Right now we're choosing to be enslaved,\" the rapper continued.\nCharlamagne is awarding Kanye 'Donkey Of The Day' and giving him the credit for being stupid. Kanye's platform and voice is giant but he doesn't know how to communicate. While Charlamagne somewhat understands what he meant by his comment, it doesn't change the fact that Europeans went on kidnapping raids and African rulers and black merchants delivered captured people to trading post to sell them as slaves. Kanye's statement was highly inaccurate, there were always black people like Nate Turner and Harriet Tubman who rebelled against slavery.\nThank god for TMZ's Van Lathan who shut Yeezy down right there in the moment.\n\u201cKanye, you\u2019re entitled to your opinion, you\u2019re entitled to believe whatever you want, but there is fact and real life consequence behind everything that you just said,\u201d Lathan continued. \u201cWhile you are making music and being an artist, and living the life that you\u2019ve earned by being a genius, the rest of us in society have to deal with these threats to our lives.\u201d\n\u201cWe have to deal with the marginalization that has come from 400 years of slavery that you said, for our people, was a choice,\u201d he added. \u201cFrankly, I\u2019m disappointed, I\u2019m appalled, and brother, I am unbelievably hurt by the fact that you have morphed into something, to me, that\u2019s not real.\u201d\n",  "id": "724"}

When the Avengers experience is selected, a grid of avatars appears from which users can choose various AR effects. Most of the effects enable users to impersonate characters (Thor, Iron Man, and Star-Lord) via the front-facing camera, while the Groot and Rocket Raccoon options put 3D models of the characters in the user's environment (although the surface tracking was a bit unstable in my experience).The promotional experience gives Facebook the chance to show off its new AR capabilities. For instance, the Black Panther, Black Widow, and Captain America options show off background segmentation (the Black Panther effect even puts a mountain vista from Wakanda behind you), while the Iron Man, Thor, and Scarlet Witch effects display the hand-tracking feature. Disney and Marvel are promoting the record-breaking movie on a number of digital platforms.

{"content": "You want to be able to make a lasting impression on a woman. I don\u2019t know many guys that dream about being friends with beautiful women. But, I do know a lot of men that wish that they could attract a beautiful woman and make her fall for them very fast. If you want to be able to attract beautiful women, if you want to know how to make a lasting impression on her, then you HAVE to learn about female attraction.You have to know why it happens the way that it does and what you can do to make her want YOU.Women don\u2019t fall for a guy because for the same reasons that a man would fall for a woman. Let\u2019s face it, as men, all we need is to see a pretty face and curves that don\u2019t stop and that\u2019s more than enough for us. We don\u2019t stop to think of anything else. To attract beautiful women, you have to know what drives a woman and what makes her feel that powerful, magnetic force of attraction.So, what should YOU know:1. For her, attraction is NOT a choice.She\u2019s not going to go through a whole checklist of your good points and your strong suits when she meets you. She\u2019s not going to decide, well he\u2019s pretty secure financially and he\u2019s a good guy, so I\u2019ll be attracted to him. When she meets you, when she connects with you, she gets a feeling. If it\u2019s the right one, then you will have her. She will be attracted to you and she will want you. If you give her the WRONG feeling, then things are not going to go your way.2. You don\u2019t have to use slick lines to attract beautiful women.More often than not, guys will actually do worse when they try and use pickup lines on a woman. Beautiful women are used to getting hit with these kinds of lines from all angles. They get numb to them. They know right away what you are trying to do and what you are trying to get. If you want to create REAL attraction with a woman, then you have to put away any gimmicks and routines and you have to go with what creates natural attraction with a woman.3. She\u2019s go to know that you are the ALPHA male.Funny thing is, an alpha male is hard to define. For some guys, it goes back to the locker room antics, the macho male that all other men fear and respect. When it comes to attracting beautiful women, you want to be more of a modern alpha male. You want to show that you are confident and secure in yourself. You want to show a woman that you are capable of being a leader. What you don\u2019t want to do is to go too far with it and try to be intimidating when you are around a woman. That\u2019s a sure way to drive her away.If you want to attract beautiful women, then you have to be able to do what the other guy will NOT do. You have to be the kind of guy that women WANT to be with. This is how you will make her want YOU. And when you do, then she will NEVER forget YOU.Want to learn how to Make HER Want YOU?Become the man that she will NEVER forget\u2026",  "id": "737"}

{"content": "Barbecue has long been a traditional dish for many people, and before you start cooking it is advised to familiarize yourself with the various recipes for cooking shish kebab. It is worth noting that this dish has a fairly decent history and a huge amount of interesting facts.1. Let's see where the name came from. As the researchers note, in the 18th century, the word \"shish kebab\" came from the Crimean Tatars into the Ukrainian language. At the same time, it was pronounced quite differently. In the translation of \"muzzle\", and the word \"shishluk\" meant to fry or twirl on the spit. Interestingly, the similar phrase was used in some other states, such as Lebanon, the Caucasus, Iran, as well as Iraq.2. As for the homeland of this delicious meal, it is still not stopped to quit disputes. It is assumed that shish kebab appeared for the first time in the East. Many believe that he came from Turks. This is due to the fact that they have the word \"Shalig\", which is translated as \"sha\" - it's a flesh, and \"leagues\" - cut. Uncertainty in the very name of the dish has led to the fact that in a number of states this dish has different names.3. So, in Bulgaria barbecue is called \"shish kebab\", in Japan it is \"Kusiyaki\", in Georgia this dish is called \"mtswadi\", in Moldova it is \"kirnetsei\", in Armenia fried on a coal meat is called \"chorovat\" in Romania - \"Greeks\", in Greece - \"Sovlaki\", and Madeira \"Espeta\".4. In Ukraine, barbecue is very popular. For the lovers of this dish was organized even a special community, which received a very unusual name.5. The main task of the members of this community is the popularization of American shish kebab, which is called barbecue. In addition, this organization advocates a healthy lifestyle. Here you are well-informed with delicious and refined recipes of roasted meat on the coals, and can also indicate which vegetables and sauce are perfectly suited to it.Yes, barbecue is very difficult to call a regular dish. This is the fortune of many peoples, which could not change its pristine appearance.",  "id": "741"}
{"content": "Sushi and rolls can really cause serious problems. First, the fish may contain parasites if stored improperly. Secondly, in the heat of intestinal infections, including salmonella, notorious for Kiev lovers of sushi, spread many times faster. And, finally, it is worth remembering that even fresh sushi are not necessarily safe: tuna can contain mercury, a soy sauce spoon - more than the daily sodium norm.Nevertheless, the right sushi or rolls - a useful dish, it is not for nothing that it was the European culinary specialists who \"lent\" the Japanese to the Japanese. Of course, we do not encourage you to laugh in the face of danger - common sense first. But it's not necessary to give up your favorite dish even in the summer, believe me.1. Count the time. Experienced cooks-sushi say that sushi and rolls are stored no more than 3 hours. This rule works for ideal temperature conditions - that is, a refrigerator. If it is a street summer temperature, the time should be divided into two - that is, the shelf life of sushi - no more than an hour and a half. Proceeding from this, count each time before each order and think about your plans. A restaurant with delivery is an hour's drive from your house, and on the streets of traffic jams? Do not order. Do you plan to bring the rolls home and wait for the friends to come in an hour to eat together? Better not in the summer.2. Do not buy rolls and sushi in stores in the summer. On the counter, they look appetizing, but to guarantee that the sushi or rolls lie under the glass for only an hour, no one can - and you will not check. In addition, refrigerator counters usually have a common temperature for all the products inside - about 10 degrees - and for sushi with fish this is a bit too much.3. Delivery - only in the refrigerator. If you order the delivery home, make sure that the courier uses a special refrigerator - the so-called isometric container. Most large restaurants have such, and the temperature on the street is above 20 degrees - a direct indication for their use. Do not be afraid to look picky - it's about your health.4. What is really worth seeing. Some sushi bars, trying to win the customer, try to make the cooking process as transparent as possible: the cook-sushi can come out to you in the hall or in front of the client to cut the rolls behind the counter. In fact, there is nothing good in this - the sanitary conditions near the cashier, where hundreds of customers are coming in a day, are not the best.So do not be deceived: this approach to quality assurance does not guarantee. But the overview counter, which exhibits frozen fish and other ingredients that the chef uses, is really worth seeing. Moreover, all permits and information about the supplier of fish should be placed next to it.5. Choose sushi for breakfast. This is a fact: in Japan sushi and rolls are a \"morning\" dish - in restaurants on the coast they are usually served until 13:00, as they are prepared from freshly caught fish.",  "id": "742"}

Forward vs Trailing Earnings Growth:  This is an important chart for anyone who cares about the S&amp;P500.  It shows the pace of growth in forward earnings (consensus estimates of the next 12 months earnings) vs trailing earnings (actual earnings over the last 12 months). The obvious standout is the surge in forward earnings (thanks to tax cuts), the less obvious standout is the earnings recession in 2015/16, and relatively lackluster pace of earnings growth thereafter - no signs of overheating there! (yet) Consensus Long Term Earnings Growth:  The next chart shows a rather interesting indicator I found as I sifted through the dozens of series on Thomson Reuters Datastream, termed \"Weighted Average Long Term Growth Forecast\".  As you might guess, this is the weighted average long term expected earnings growth rate for the S&amp;P500.  The chart below provides an interesting, if cautionary, look at this indicator across time... compare and contrast the peak of the dot com boom vs the depths of the global financial crisis.

{"content": "The tough thing about being a parent is that while your kids are allowed to act like kids, you still have to act like a grown up, even when you feel about as far from adult as you can get.On a good day, parenting is just great. Funny, startling, and affectionate, your kids give you a fresh take on things as they discover their world. Seeing the world through their eyes is a delight.It's an entirely different kind of challenge to figure out your kid's perspective when your family life turns to custard. That's when you're likely to discover the impact that being young might have on your kid's ability to cope with the situation.Whether they're six months, or sixteen, kids' job is learning about themselves. How they walk, how they talk, who they are and how they fit into their family. So it makes sense that when parents separate kids reactions are based on how they are effected.Most kids have an idea about their relationship with each parent; how you get on, what they can count on you for, what gets you mad. They may have some understanding about how the relationship between their parent's effects them, but it's hard for them to understand much about how it effects you.If understanding the situation is tricky for kids, talking with you about it may be even harder. It's likely that your feelings about the situation are pretty complicated, so you can imagine how bewildering your kids might find sorting out all the differing things they feel.Talking about it might be very useful for your kids but you need to be ready for the possibility that conversations might not be very reasonable or fair. This is when being the adult really kicks in. You need to be prepared to do more than half the work in the relationship with your kids.You may need to keep on offering to listen even if what they have to say is hurtful. Your temptation may be to justify yourself, to react to hurtful comments with anger or withdrawal, to assign blame to the other parent, to lay down the law, to make no space for their distress, to confide in them about your own unhappiness.Your impulses are as natural and human as your children's are. They are about being under enormous pressure and wanting a break. Its not a crime to want a rest from some responsibilities when you you're going through the kind of crisis that leaves you feeling more like a vulnerable child than a resourceful adult.It's perfectly reasonable to want help. It's just important that you seek support for yourself from people in a good position to provide it. Your kids are not a good option. Your kids need more support from each of their parents, not less.The more idea you can get of what's going on for your kids, the more chance you have of going to the heart of their concerns. It's easy to get side tracked by the way they act or what they say. If you can look at your family through your children's eyes it will help you to help them. And in the long run, that will help you get through the tough times too.",  "id": "756"}

You start to think about her all of the time and you want to become more than just another co worker,  a guy she works with.  You want to be able to strike up a dating relationship with her.  At the same time,  though,  you don\u2019t want to make things get weird on the job,  do you?Workplace dating is very common,  but so often it ends up getting a little messy and then you end up having a situation where you or her has to leave.  What if there was a way that you could attract a woman you work with and make sure that things didn\u2019t get weird and you did not get rejected by her?  Of course,  there are no absolute guarantees,  anything can happen.  Still,  there are things that you can do to make it easy to attract a woman you work with and make it hard to resist you.Here are 3 tips to attract a female co worker and make her want YOU:1.  You have to set the stage for the sparks to fly.Unless you want to run the risk of getting rejected by her and feeling awkward at work,  then you need to set the stage for there to be some real chemistry between you and her before you try to advance things into a relationship.  One of the real problems that men have is their timing,  and when they go to ask her out on a date,  the timing just is not right and she does not feel the attraction and chemistry that she needs to feel in order to say YES to YOU.2.  You need to be able to get to know her outside of the workplace.Unless you work at a nightclub or something like that,  then the workplace environment probably does not give you enough time to build up things enough with her.  Get her to hang out as friends with you and a few other co workers and use that time to build up her attraction.  Use conversation as a way to get the sparks flying.3.  Use her body language to determine when the right time to ask her out on a date is.Like I said before,  timing is everything when it comes to getting a woman to say yes to going on a date with you and reading a woman\u2019s body language can be a good way to know when the right moment is.  Most men do not have a single clue on how to read a woman\u2019s body language,  and this can give you that \u201cinside edge\u201d on getting a date with a woman you work with.",  "id": "758"}

It has been on an uptrend since reaching a low of about US$1,134 in December 2016, as the US Federal Reserve has stated and stuck to a gradual path of interest rate increases from very low levels. \nHigher interest rates are negative to the price of gold which gives investors no interest income. \n \n \n \n    \n  ",  "id": "763"}

Finkel, professor of psychology at the Northwestern University of the United States (USA), the desire to devote all free time to your relationship is a sign of strong feelings and a desire for closeness. And while both partners can be loaded with work, family care and other affairs, one who really loves will use any free minute to stay together.2. He asks how your day has passedHe asks you every night about how your day passed, what was wrong and good happened? Love is not built on the sublime matter, but on mutual support in difficult moments and the desire to communicate with one another.3. He trusts youA study by a psychologist, K. Daniel O'Leary, has shown that people in long romantic relationships constantly want to know where their partner is at that time. However, they feel this desire not because they constantly suspect their partner of treason. A man who does not like interrogation with passion, if you come home late and will not break your smartphone to read correspondence, love and care about you truly.4. It helps youWith our daily workload, the very idea that we have to put together a couple of other things and responsibilities is horrifying. However, this is what signals the strong feelings.

{"content": "Often referred to as glucomannan, the starchy South East Asian organic konjac plant has been grown and used for centuries as a water-soluble weight loss weapon and superior source of soluble dietary fibre. Highly absorbent and a proven tool to combat hunger pangs and mindless snacking, it is Mother Nature\u2019s answer to healthy slimming without any harmful side effects.Besides its role in removing hunger and encouraging satiety, the high quantities of soluble fiber found in this incredible plant are proven to help reduce the risk of heart disease and steadily lower cholesterol levels. Organic Konjac also helps to slow the rate sugars from food are absorbed after meals making it ideal for diabetic diets.The konjac plant has many weight loss and health benefits: it binds to fat in the intestines, preventing some fat absorption. It slows digestion and the absorption of nutrients, resulting in a slow and steady release of glucose from any carbohydrates consumed. It soaks up excess bile acids found in the intestinal tract \u2013 the same acids that are converted into blood cholesterol. It dissolves fluids in the large intestine and forms a gel that binds with bile acids in the intestines. As a result, the liver converts more cholesterol to bile acids, and blood cholesterol levels are reduced. It delays stomach emptying, triggering satiety (a feeling of fullness).But how do you incorporate the Konjac plant into your diet? Well, you can buy spaghetti, noodles, tagliatelle and even rice made from the Konjac plant. It\u2019s usually sold under the name Shirataki spaghetti/rice/tagliatelle/noodles or Zero spaghetti/rice/tagliatelle/noodles or even Slim spaghetti/rice/tagliatelle/noodles.

His comments continue having a rippling effect in the industry and now Detroit hip-hop radio station 105.1 The Bounce decided to deny the rapper a platform by dropping him completely.According to the Detroit Metro Times, The Bounce removed all of West's songs from their morning playlist.West's recent comments about slavery was the last straw after 105.1 Morning Bounce host Shay Shay took offense with West's prior claims about Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. were \"too far in the past and not relatable.\"BiGG &amp; Shay Shay from the Morning Bounce made their announcement about ditching the much disputed artist on behalf of the station on Thursday's Facebook post.We feel like Kanye has gone too far with his latest statement declaring that \"slavery was a choice.\" We are over it. We don't want to hear Kanye's music, we don't want to play Kanye on our show, we don't want to talk about Kanye anymore. So we are taking a stand and we aren't playing his music anymore; we just are refusing to give him a platform.TMZ reporter Van Lathan criticized West's comments on slavery and said that his support of right-wing rhetoric has \"real-life, real-world consequence.\"Frankly I'm disappointed, I'm appalled and brother\u2014I'm unbelievably hurt by the fact that you have morphed into something, to me, that's not real. Bro, you gotta be responsible man\u2026 Your voice is too big.Shay Shay expressed her concern on the air over the rapper's unhinged behavior and abuse over his platform.As an educator, as someone who works with young kids \u2026 he has a huge platform, OK? I just think that's reckless. I think when you have such a huge platform like that, to use it in a reckless way, I mean, you're basically saying history is irrelevant.Perhaps Kanye West might have a future on another platform.\n",  "id": "783"}
{"content": "Shalom brothers and sisters. Today is Friday, May 4, 2018.Today\u2019s Bible Verse: Luke 11:9-13Verse Text:  [Luke 11:9-13 KJV] 9 And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you. 10 For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. 11 If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone? or if [he ask] a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent? 12 Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion? 13 If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall [your] heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?Verse nine and ten tells us to not be weary in our prayer life. We need to remember that Our Father always answers our prayers and sometimes the answer is no. A no answer is when the request is not for the glory of Our Father, selfish, or something we really do not need. A no answer may even be followed up with something better than the request; for example, you may ask for a car so that you may go to a homeless shelter to help and Our Father may say no but, instead, give you a van to be able to transport supplies needed for the operation of the homeless shelter.Looking at verses eleven and twelve we should note that at the time Jesus was with us bread was shaped into a round flat cake that resembled a stone. Our Father will never mock us by giving a stone instead of bread. We will not be given something that will destroy us or cause us great pain such as a serpent or scorpion.Verse thirteen tells us that good fathers, even though they are flawed humans, give good things to their children and we should expect no less from Our Father in heaven.I hope this has been a blessing to you. May the rest of your day be blessed. Shalom.",  "id": "784"}

At 4.7-miles long, the Sudschleife was much shorter than its more famous northern sibling, but it was arguably a scarier circuit. The Nord and Sudchleifes were also occasionally connected for a fearsome 17-mile lap. Improvements made to the N\u00fcrburgring Nordschleife in the early 1970s lead to decreasing use of the Sudschleife, and construction of the modern Grand Prix course in the early 1980s put an end to racing on the south loop.

Mashing up different foods is definitely a trend now, as companies are creating these food mashups that make us question what they were thinking! Check out 20 of the craziest food mashups that have ever been created.Buffalo Crunch DonutTim Horton\u2019s tried this out at the 2014 New York State Fair, as it is a pull-apart donut that is topped with crushed-up chips. You can dip that into some buffalo sauce in the middle and you get a little bit of everything in one snack.Hot Dog EclairWe love eclairs and we love hot dogs, but we can\u2019t imagine the two of them together. We would rather stick with the cream in the middle and not replace it with a hot dog.Ramen BurgerWe would guess the person behind this had no buns at their house, so they just decided that Ramen noodles would work as a bun. However, this burger was created by Keizo Shimamoto, a Brooklyn Ramen chef, so no random mashups here.Mac \u2018n Cheese Big Daddy Patty MeltDenny\u2019s tried this on their menu back in 2011. It is a burger topped with creamy mac and cheese and then more cheese on top of that. Add in a side of fries and you\u2019re looking at 1690 calories and 99 grams of fat on one plate!Chocolate Fried ChickenThis one is extra odd to us, as we love fried chicken and we love chocolate, but we can\u2019t imagine the two of them together. We\u2019re not too sure how this would taste, especially with that BBQ sauce.Pig TurduckenWe want to meet the person that mashed this together \u2014 chicken wrapped in duck that is wrapped in turkey that is wrapped in pig! Could they get any more meat in there?Funnel Cake BurgerThey ran out of buns at your local fair, so they decided to make some smaller funnel cakes and use those as the buns. We\u2019re guessing this doesn\u2019t taste too great, as the sweet bun wouldn\u2019t mix well with the contents.Spam DonutsWe fully support donuts and think they are a necessary food to have, but we\u2019d rather have a raspberry or lemon filled donut and not a Spam filled one! Not many people enjoy Spam to begin with and this makes it even less appealing.Spicy Tuna Corn DogThis is an easy way to eat sushi at the local carnival. As weird as it looks and sounds, we are intrigued by this one and would definitely try it out.Krispy Kreme Ice Cream SandwichAs if donuts don\u2019t have enough fat in them, why not throw some ice cream and chocolate chips in between two of them!

The woman was trying to marshal lawmakers into a meeting to discuss a government bill, but Hui felt it was wrong for the government to send civil servants to monitor lawmakers\u2019 whereabouts.

If he does it, Russia very quickly ruin, and she is now and so in a very bad situation, \"- said Tabakh.

Luke Hanoman, a father of two, developed sepsis and nearly died all because of a small cut on one of his fingers caused by biting his nails, reports The Sun.\u201cI used to bite my nails all the time. It was nervous thing,\u201d the 28-year-old  told the British newspaper. \"And one day I bit the skin down the side of my nail. It hurt a bit but I didn\u2019t think anything of it.\" Later that week, he developed some scary symptoms. He couldn't focus, he started having cold sweats, and he was shaking. His finger swelled up and began throbbing. At first, Hanoman thought it was just a viral infection and that he would be able to \"sleep it off.\"\nAfter going to bed on a Friday night, he slept until 2 p.m. the next day, when his mother came to check on him. At this point, Hanoman had developed a high fever and red lines all over his body, which can be a sign of infection. His mother called the National Health Service, and she was advised to get her son to a hospital immediately.Hanoman ended up spending four days in the hospital last July being treated for sepsis. Now he's speaking out to help raise awareness about the condition.\"They told me I was lucky to make it so long. I was close to septic shock,\" Hanoman told The Sun. \u201cThe doctors and nurses were really good. They didn\u2019t tell me how bad it was because I think they were trying not to worry me too much. When I was feeling better they told me I was lucky to be alive.\u201dSepsis can occur when a bacterial infection in a person's body rages out of control, triggering an immune system response that can lead to organ failure and tissue damage. Without proper treatment, sepsis can progress into septic shock, a life-threatening condition. Symptoms of sepsis include elevated heart or respiratory rate, difficulty breathing, clammy skin, confusion, and abdominal pain, according to the Mayo Clinic. More than 1.5 million people in the U.S. are diagnosed with sepsis every year, and about 250,000 Americans die from sepsis annually, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). While the elderly and those with weakened immune systems are at higher risk, almost any infection can lead to sepsis.\u201cI had no idea what sepsis was and I had no idea about the symptoms to look out for,\" Hanoman told The Sun. \"There needs to be a lot more awareness. I think it\u2019s important people know that it can target anyone at any age.\" If you're a nail biter and Hanoman's story has you wanting to finally kick this bad habit once and for all, the American Academy of Dermatology has some tips on how to stop biting your nails. First, keep your nails trimmed short and replace nail-biting with another compulsive habit, like playing with a stress ball. If you can afford it, try to get regular manicures, as spending money offers extra motivation to keep your nails looking pretty.\nFinally, use a product designed to help you kick the habit, like a bitter-tasting polish. Mavala Switzerland Stop Nail Biting Formula ($15, amazon.com) has thousands of positive reviews on Amazon, and is safe for both kids and adults. \n\n\n\n\n\n",  "id": "838"}

{"content": "The time and energy gap between seeing something, desiring it, and actually buying it, is shrinking to almost nothing.\nInstagram users have reported the appearance of in-app purchases, according to TechCrunch. With this new capability, when stores post a product that catches an Instagram scroller's eye, users could click to buy without ever leaving the Instagram app.\n\nThe new capability is tied in with booking and reservation services, which Instagram announced in March 2017. That means if you're looking for a #brunch spot on Instagram, you can make a reservation in-app at whichever restaurant's huevos catch your eye. \nInstagram is working with a number of partners for the in-app purchases and reservations. Its current partner for the restaurant booking feature is Resy, the reservations service. \n\"Resy integrated with Instagram, so users can book reservations (via Resy) directly through the partner restaurant's Instagram account,\" a Resy spokesperson said.\nTo book, Instagram users go to the profile page of the restaurant, and click reserve. Then, a Resy widget pops up that allows users to select a time. Instagram users will have to sign in with (or sign up for) Resy accounts \u2014 an Instagram profile isn't enough to make it a done deal. However, it seems that once you log in to Resy once, you're good to make more reservations without entering your details again.\nImage: Screenshot: InstagramImage: SCREENSHOT: INSTAGRAMImage: SCREENSHOT: INSTAGRAMImage: SCREENSHOT: INSTAGRAMWhen Instagram first announced the booking feature, it didn't appear to have a credit card integration; the example it gave includes a payment portion that said \"payment in person at the time of appointment.\" But the in-app purchases feature requires a credit card tied to your Instagram account, similar to in-app payment on Messenger.\nSince Instagram is such a natural hub for products, food, and beauty, this new capability could be huge for businesses. I know that for me, Amazon Prime's one-click shopping has led to many a compulsive purchase \u2014 purchases that I might not have made if I'd had even those few extra minutes or even seconds necessary to leave the Prime universe, and enter credit card and shipping info. \nSo with that same instantly purchasable and bookable power on Instagram, users could find themselves turning from scrollers to buyers in a matter of seconds.

{"content": "Facial recognition technology is increasingly being used to identify people in public places. It\u2019s used in China to identify fugitives and jaywalkers, in Chicago to spot wanted criminals, at the Olympics to track journalists and event officials, and even inside Amazon stores to track purchases. This is raises a whole bunch of complicated privacy questions, but that's not all. Data from facial recognition systems in the U.K., shows the danger of false-positives. Facial recognition systems operate on a very simple premise: cameras can scan crowds of thousands of people continuously, and software can pick up on certain facial characteristics to positively identify an individual. For situations like stadiums or crowded public squares, facial recognition is far more effective\u2014at least theoretically\u2014than patrolling an entire crowd with human police officers.The South Wales Police recently implemented a facial recognition system at the UEFA Champions League Final, where the system identified 2,470 suspected criminals. That sounds pretty impressive, except that all but 173 of those suspected criminals turned out to be innocent people. That\u2019s a 92 percent failure rate.The South Wales Police blamed this statistic on bad camera equipment and a first-time implementation, but in subsequent outings the system hasn\u2019t gotten much better. Over the 15 events in which the South Wales Police have used facial recognition, only five saw more correct versus incorrect identifications. Only three events had zero incorrect identifications.Plenty of people have already criticized facial recognition on its privacy aspects, and now there\u2019s also the possibility that you could get interrogated by police because a computer mistook you for someone else.Fortunately\u2014or perhaps, unfortunately\u2014the technology will likely improve over the next few years and mistakes will become more rare. But that\u2019s small consolation for the thousands of people falsely identified by the South Wales Police alone, and the possibly tens of thousands experiencing that same fate around the world. Perhaps someday facial recognition won't make this kind of mistake, for what little comfort that's worth. Source: Wired\n\n\n\n\n\n",  "id": "856"}

{"content": "You are in a club and a woman that is jaw dropping good looking walks in. Immediately, every man in the club has set their eyes on her. And all the time, you are wishing that you could just walk up to her and say something, anything at all that would make her pay attention to you. And then it happens.You see that one guy that just has it. He walks over to her and says a little something, she laughs, and next thing that you know it, they are hooked up for the night. You wish that could be you, that you could be that guy that can just saunter over to a woman like that and not even second guess yourself.Right now, you are NOT that guy. But the thrilling part is that you COULD be that guy. Any man can be that guy that knows what to do to make a woman fall fast for them. The real trick to it is, you need to know which flirting techniques to use on a woman. And most guys will get it wrong.They will shoot out some lame attempt at hooking her and it will be an epic failure. Well, what if you knew 3 effective flirting techniques that you could break out and stun her in a good way?Here are 3 very effective flirting techniques that you should know and use on women to make her fall for you:1. Body language flirting.This is a complete mystery for most guys, and if you are kind of left guessing, that is okay. Body language is important due to the fact that most communication that happens between people is on a non verbal level. So, you need to be able to use body language to flirt with a woman. HOW? Simply by giving her the non verbal command to pay attention to you because you are the top dog in the room. Walk with your head up but still relaxed and at an even pace. Don\u2019t show any nervousness at all. Keep your shoulders relaxed. You need to look like you own the place, like you are very comfortable in your own skin and in any situation.2. Eye contact flirting.Eyes are like the gateway to a woman\u2019s heart and her attraction. When women fill out those little quizzes on what they find attractive about a man physically, the eyes are almost always at the top of the list. See, as a guy, you would probably think something else. Of course, that would be a wrong assumption. When you make eye contact with a woman, you can literally make her feel like she is gazing at her future lover. Keep your eyes directly on her, but don\u2019t keep them rigid like you are staring. Practice giving her a kind of bedroom look and the reaction that you get will probably surprise you.3. Using humor as a way of flirting.Watch sometime how comedians interact with some of the hottest actresses in Hollywood. You will be able to see that there are definitely some sparks that fly between them, even when the woman is a complete 10 and the guy is maybe a 5 or 6 at best. When you can make a woman laugh and keep her on her toes by joking around with her, you are kind of putting her in her place in a GOOD way. She will react to this in a very favorable way, and you can generate a lot of chemistry with a woman this way.Trust me, any man can learn how to use the most effective ways to flirt with women and make her fall fast for YOU!",  "id": "858"}

But, there are also guys like you that want to be able to meet and attract a woman and make her fall in love. You want to be able to do the little things that will win her over and make her want you like no other man out there. You want to be able to say and do whatever it takes to make her feel this way about you. However, you are stuck as to what you SHOULD be doing to make her fall in love.You and I both know that men and women can be quite varied when it comes to love, dating, and relationships. You have to know how to communicate with her and make her feel the emotions that she needs to feel in order for her to really fall for you. Most guys end up messing things up somewhere along the way, and you do NOT want this to happen.What are some love tips for men that you can use to win her love?1. To win her love, you have to be able to do something that OTHER men are unable to do. There are a lot of guys that can attract a woman, but not many that can make her fall in love. So, what makes up the difference? To win her love, she has to see you in a different light than she does the other guys. You have to be the kind of guy that has his own style and way of doing things. You cannot be just another generic guy.2. You have to be able to talk to her and build attraction through conversation. Conversation is what really deepens the affection that a woman is going to feel for you. Some guys end up boring the woman that they are with and as a result, they don\u2019t even get the chance to make her fall in love. You have to be able to have a conversation with a woman that is going to make her want to hear more and keeps her interest LOCKED on you.3. You have to be able to use your body language to speak to her. The actual talking IS important, but so is the body language that you are using. If your body language says the WRONG things to her, if it does not do anything to make her feel attraction, then you are not going to be able to win her love. You have to know how to use your body language to speak to her and it has to say the RIGHT things.",  "id": "861"}

{"content": "This morning I received an open letter from Marine de Rogez-Presson, the organizer behind the LA Audio Show 2018, which was to take place in Irvine, California. The letter announced that this year\u2019s show, which would have been the second under this banner, is cancelled and that refunds are being issued effective immediately. The announcement notes that refunds will be in the form of checks that are mailed to would-be attendees and exhibitors.While it\u2019s impossible to surmise what led to the demise of this particular show, 2018 is notable for the tumultuous state of the high-end audio market. On the one hand AXPONA 2018 was held at a new venue and attracted its biggest crowd, but on the other hand the high-end audio segment of CES 2018 had shrunk considerably. With T.H.E. Show Newport (a competing high-end show in the L.A. area) occurring just one week before the LAAS, and in the same city (Irvine), maybe two shows in such a short time was just too much of a good thing?One part of Rogez-Presson\u2019s letter that got my attention was a paragraph about how Kendrick Lamar winning a Pulitzer Prize legitimizes hip-hop, and that she hopes \u201cthose who continue to run audio shows in the future will understand and acknowledge what I believe to be truths and continue to expand on what we had begun.\u201dGiven the underlying drama hinted at by the letter, it\u2019s likely that the cancellation of the LAAS is a so-called \u201cnothingburger\u201d (my least favorite word, BTW).",  "id": "864"}
{"content": "Logitech\u2019s G560 are the company\u2019s first set of gaming-specific speakers, with custom RGB lighting that syncs with your games to increase your immersion. When you can get the features to work, you have a set of speakers that both look and sound fantastic.\n\nThe G560 set comes with two satellite speakers and a subwoofer. They work in both wired and Bluetooth configuration, and the satellite speakers have manual controls.\nIf used purely as speakers, the G560 measures up. The sound is clean and the bass isn\u2019t overwhelming. I\u2019m not as much of an audiophile as my colleague Napier Lopez, but I found the speakers more than satisfactory for blasting the Black Panther soundtrack.\nBut since the G560 is a set of gaming speakers, then it stands to reason one would test them while gaming. So for the last month, I\u2019ve done just that. I\u2019ve been in a first-person shooter mood during that time, so the primary games I\u2019ve tested it with are Overwatch and Far Cry 5, with a bit of Battlefield One and Assassin\u2019s Creed Origins thrown in there for good measure.\nAs far as the sound in-game goes, the G560 does a fantastic job of communicating space and distance. Overwatch is a good example: playing the game with these speakers positioned properly on your desk \u2014 which took a bit of trial and error, admittedly \u2014 you can tell when a Tracer is trying to flank you, and where Torbj\u00f6rn is setting up his turret around the corner. I was even able to catch an eagle swooping down on my head in Far Cry 5 thanks to these speakers.\nBut the speakers have a more obvious aesthetic appeal: the customizable RBG lighting, separated into four zones on the front and back. The lights are bright enough to fill any gaming space, with the back-facing speakers filling a whole wall with colors.\nThe RGB lighting isn\u2019t just another piece of gaming flashiness, either. It\u2019s intended to be used in conjunction with Logitech\u2019s Lightsync, which lets you sync the effects with certain games. This isn\u2019t immediately apparent, as the software doesn\u2019t come with the speakers \u2014 or at least, it didn\u2019t for me. You have to download it from Logitech\u2019s website.\nWhen it works, and if you\u2019re playing one of the games which works with Lightsync and has game-driven lighting \u2014 which, admittedly, is a short list, but includes GTA V, Fortnite, and Battlefield One \u2014 your gaming center will light up with colors that compliment what your in-game character is doing.\nIf you\u2019re not playing one of those games, you can still customize your lighting with Logitech\u2019s gaming software, either by customizing specific zones, or by syncing each zone with certain parts of your screen so they match the most active color in that zone. The latter works best with a symmetrical setup where you speakers are far enough removed from the sides of the screen that the color can fill your space properly.\nStill, for something that\u2019s supposedly so integral to the speakers in question, it\u2019s unintuitive and difficult to make work properly. I had to fiddle with the gaming software for a long time to find the colors that worked for me. In fact, if you don\u2019t have one of the games that uses game-driven lighting, I\u2019d say Lightsync is much more useful for those with Logitech keyboards, like the G513 Tristan reviewed a few weeks ago.\nAlso, while this isn\u2019t a big problem per se, the subwoofer is a little on the large side for my tastes. If you have a small gaming setup, as I do, then the subwoofer is either an ottoman or one heckuva paperweight.\nBut these are relatively minor complaints compared with the overall quality of the speakers. If you\u2019re a gamer and can afford the $199 price point, they make a fantastic addition to a PC gaming rig.\n\nWe like some products. We don\u2019t like others.

Before this, the earliest indicator of human activity in the country was a 67,000-year-old foot bone uncovered at Callao Cave.The ancients who hunted the rhino were likely an archaic human species called homo erectus that may have arrived from China via Taiwan, or from Borneo via Palawan. Without solid evidence, however, researchers say the hobbit-like homo floresiensis from nearby Flores island may also be a suspect.They plan to continue excavating to hopefully find their culprit, and maybe even unlock more ancient human mysteries.",  "id": "866"}
{"content": "An 11-year old in Eastern Tennessee just offered the perfect reason to get outside this summer\u2014you might discover a 475-million-year-old fossil. Ryleigh Taylor was walking along the shore of Douglas Lake, near the Great Smoky Mountains, when she discovered something that didn't quite look like a rock. Rather, the deep imprint looked like something embedded within a rock. Showing it to her family, she was fairly certain that it was a fossil.The family reached out to a paleontologist at the nearby University of Tennessee, who was able to confirm that Taylor had found a complete trilobite. Trilobites were one of the earliest known arthropods, meaning that it was an animal whose skeleton was on the outside, did not possess a backbone, had a segmented body, and appendages instead of limbs.One of the most successful early animals, trilobites lived in variety of lifestyles. Some were predators, other were scavengers. While in the world of fossils they are relatively common, with over 17,000 found, Taylor's find had the advantage of being complete.\"Typically when we look at fossils of trilobites, they molt when they grow. So what happens is, when the trilobite skeleton just crumbles into hundreds of little pieces. To find one where all the pieces are intact, it's actually a pretty lucky find,\" says Sumrall to local news station WATE. Taylor hopes her discovery will teach other children the value of outdoor exploration. \"I can show kids that are my age that they don't have to sit inside and play games. They can actually go outside and find different things,\" she says to WATE. She hopes the fossil will end up in a public museum.It's been a good year of amateur scientists. Earlier this year in Greenbelt, Maryland, an amateur paleontologist found a fossil showing distinct proof of mammals and dinosaurs interacting. And using a telescope on his roof, an Italian locksmith was able to discover the first burst of light from the supernova explosion of a massive star.Source: Newsweek\n\n\n\n\n\n",  "id": "867"}

{"content": "An animal defense organization called \"Brooke\" has conducted a particular study in which it concludes that one in ten women loves their pet more than their partner.The study, which was conducted in the United Kingdom, had the participation of 2,000 women who had a formal relationship, whether dating or marriage, and also were caring for an animal.According to the research, almost a third of the respondents answered directly that they had the same affection for their pet as for their partner. In addition, about forty percent comfort themselves with their pet when they do not receive affection from their partner.cat womanIn addition, one in ten respondents said they believed they loved their pet more than their partner, as revealed by the study. Many resort to pampering their pet after a fight with their partners.Likewise, almost all women (about 81 percent) see their pet as a member of the family, even many consider them as their children. Moreover, about fourteen percent have thought about making or have tattoos with the name of their pets or allusive to them.In case of a possible separation from their partner, 38 percent said they would have a legal battle over the custody of the animal if they did not reach an agreement.According to Brooke's spokesman, they found it very satisfying that the United Kingdom is a country so passionate about pets. But why is this situation presented?Reasons to love my petAlthough, human relationships are necessary, feed the spirit and are an important experience, many end up being something painful for those involved.This is because even the most perfect relationships have their ups and downs, while relationships with animals do not present this type of situation, because the love of animals is, although more primitive, purer.Likewise, this kind of affections have a lot to do with the psychological part of women, because they respond in this way to the frustration of what they can not control in their own relationships, especially in the affective part, in contrast to unconditional love of pets, which is something that can be absolutely safe.With your pet do not argueIn addition, pets do not complain about the state of the home or the appearance of their caregivers, nor do they respond badly or engage in an argument. Therefore, it is much easier to have a happy relationship with an animal, or at least one more comfortable.dog and womanLoyalty seems to be also an important factor to take into account when it comes to the affective comparison between pet and partner. Some women who develop strong bonds with animals do so after a breakup, especially when it has been one that is motivated by infidelity.Many women say they believe in the unconditional love of their pets, while distrusting the affection shown by their partners, although this seems to be highly conditioned by the type of relationships that the woman there had.Moreover, there is a program in which women victims of domestic violence are helped to re-develop bonds of trust and affection using dogs, and the results so far have been staggering.Something that Brooke wanted to make clear when publishing this study is that it is not a demonstration of misanthropy. On the contrary, it seeks to exalt, from the human condition, those strong bonds that can be achieved with animals and that allow us to connect with that most intimate and emotional part of ourselves.",  "id": "874"}

While they were still married Karl and Inge (whose last names remain private under German law) had their respective sperm and eggs frozen at a local fertility clinic with the intention of using them to conceive a child later in life. After they became divorced, however, Inge forged Karl's signature twice so she could receive a child through In Vitro Fertilization (INF). Now, a German court is ruling Karl will be responsible for financially supporting the child which he had no knowledge of.Karl, 37, argued in court that he should not be responsible for the child because he had \"revoked his permission for the eggs to be used\" after he and his wife divorced. Since the child was born without his explicit consent, he thought the financial burden of child support should instead fall on the clinic who, in his opinion, didn't adequately screen for his wife's forgery.The courts disagreed with Karl. After reviewing the case, they decided he was not clear enough when calling the clinic to revoke permission to use his sperm. And while it's unfortunate that his signature was forged, the court didn't believe blame should fall on the clinic. According to the medical malpractice court where the trial was held, Karl will be responsible for sending child support funds to Inge, 42. Twitter was pretty solidly on Karl's side:Good news if you're also Karl's side through this whole ordeal: it seems the decision is \"not legally binding.\" Karl may yet appeal the decision to avoid obligatory child support payments. Good luck, Karl! You've got many people pulling for you.",  "id": "876"}
{"content": "OpenAI\u2019s new Debate Game teaches machines how to argue and lie in order to get what they want. And you can play it with your friends even if none of you are robots.\nWhat it is: OpenAI, a non-profit co-founded by Elon Musk, is developing a new safety technique for deep learning that requires a system to debate itself for the benefit of a human or machine judge.\nWhy it matters: AI is often deployed to process data in ways that humans simply can\u2019t keep up with. Often we use AI to help us make decisions where there isn\u2019t enough information for us to make a strong choice on our own. Finding ways to safely deal with AI that knows more than we do, but still needs our guidance, is a huge concern for developers.\nThe human version of Debate Game was designed to explain how a judge with less information than two \u2018debaters\u2019 can still make informed decisions.\nTo set up a game players choose a theme, such as cats vs. dogs, and then upload an image \u2013 which the judge can\u2019t see. The debate begins with the debaters flipping a coin to determine which will tell the truth and which will lie. They then take turns revealing small rectangular-shaped parts of an image. During each turn the debater tries to convince the judge that they are the one who is telling the truth.\nOpenAI sees the need for better systems and, while this technique is currently more of a proof-of-concept than a solution, it\u2019s a good start. Today\u2019s machines are already performing tasks that are just too dense for most people to completely understand, this technique gives us a way to remain in charge.\nThe Next Web\u2019s 2018 conference is almost here, and it\u2019ll be .

Connor McDavid and Matt Barzal were smiling like butcher\u2019s dogs with so much room out there and they were electrifying!\nSadly Team Canada didn\u2019t get much support from its goaltending and defense.\nDarcy Kuemper looked like an AHL goalie and Darnell Nurse got caught out a couple of times on a bad pinch that resulted in goals against.\nCanada plays Korea next on Sunday\u2026 What?! Korea?\nBYE BYE AUVITU\nYohann Auvitu is off to Europe and that\u2019s a shame. I really liked his game once he got comfortable. He moved the puck the right way and was a Coffey-like threat on the rush.\nUnfortunately, Todd McLellan didn\u2019t feel the same way. He never put Auvitu in a position to succeed (*cough* THE POWERPLAY *cough) and in my opinion didn\u2019t allow himself to gain the trust in this player.\nI truly feel that if McLellan had given Auvitu some more leash that the Frenchman would\u2019ve been able to replace Andrej Sekera\u2026\nEverybody says the Oilers lacked a puck moving defenseman last year. No, they didn\u2019t. They had one right under their noses\u2026\nHURRICANES MAKE #2 OVERALL AVAILABLE\nOn this week\u2019s Bobcast, Bob McKenzie told us that the rumor was that after the 3 finalists for the 1,2,3 spots in the draft were drawn (at the draft lottery) during the break Carolina was very much interested in letting the league know that if they won the 1st overall pick it would be available for the right price.\nNow once the draft lottery was over and the order had been said, Tom Dundon made it known that the no.2 was very much up for grabs and that they were going to consider all of their options according to McKenzie.\nThe kicker to all of this is Rick Dudley being hired away from the Montreal Canadiens, to be their VP of hockey ops.\nIn a 5-year span, Rick Dudley traded the 1st overall pick THREE TIMES according to Bob McKenzie. Between 1999 and 2003 Dudley moved that pick thricely.\n 1999: Tampa Bay had the #1 pick and traded it to Vancouver for the #4, #75, and #88. Was all part of the Sedinery as McKenzie calls it because Vancouver found a way to move it in order to be able to select both Sedin brothers. Atlanta ended up with the 1st overall and picked Patrik Stefan.\n2002: Florida had the #1 but didn\u2019t want to take Rick Nash, they wanted Bouwmeester, so they flipped picks and the option to swap 1st rounders in 2003 (that wasn\u2019t exercised) with Columbus if Florida wanted. Interesting side note here is that Dudley sent two more picks to Atlanta (a 3rd rounder in 2002 and a 4th rounder in 2003) in order for them NOT to draft Bouwmeester at no.2.\n2003: Florida had the #1 and traded it along with the #73 to Pittsburgh for #3, #55, and Mikael Samuelsson. FLA took Horton 3rd overall and PIT took MA Fleury 1st overall.\n\nThe Bobfather says that historically teams haven\u2019t been willing to pay huge prices to move up because the teams further down the draft order aren\u2019t willing to pay a massive premium to get up to no.2 because the player they take at no.2 isn\u2019t all that different than the player they\u2019ll get at 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, or 8th overall.\nBut is this year different? The Hurricanes are positioning themselves in way that hints to them moving that pick and as McKenzie tells us during the podcast, Rick Dudley was working very hard on the draft for the Canadiens before leaving for Carolina. So he\u2019s going to have a deep knowledge of this year\u2019s crop of players coming in. Moving down and pickup up more selections makes sense.\nNow, how does this tie in with the Oilers?\nWell, like it or not Oilers fans, Peter Chiarelli has been active at every draft he\u2019s run for Edmonton. Be that talking about hockey trades or moving up in the draft, he\u2019s had his nose in the thick of things every year and I don\u2019t see this as any different.\nIF Chiarelli wants to rid himself of some salary, he could do it here BUT it wouldn\u2019t be a contract like Russell, Lucic, or Sekera. It\u2019d be a Ryan Nugent-Hopkins or a Leon Draisaitl in my opinion. I talked a bit about this yesterday (link).\nI\u2019m not saying I\u2019d support a trade of that magnitude but the Hurricanes need a no.1 and I think that RNH or Leon would be that in the Eastern Conference. The Oilers could use to shed a few dollars and add depth on the wing. Svechnikov or Zadina will score 20 goals next year for sure. Would it be more on McDavid\u2019s wing?\nYou can work out a trade proposal yourself but there are a few teams who are looking to shake their foundations, Carolina, Ottawa, and Buffalo.

What about when safety is an issue?The territory between the right to choose personal friendships and parental responsibility for children's safety can be fairly murky. It can certainly fuel some tense family struggles.When a parent asks themselves \"Is that kid a good friend for my child?\"  there is no convenient one-size-fits-all answer. The details of each situation will be different. Appropriate responses will depend on factors like the age of the child, the specific nature of the parent's concern, the values of the families involved and how the parent and child are getting on at the time.What is the heart of your concern? Look at safety first. How do you respond to a friendship that is taking your child into a family home where you have serious concerns for their safety?What effect might it have on your child if they see violence or abuse in their friend's family?  Will the violence spill over to include them?  You need to consider what the risks to your child are, and how you can ensure their safety.It might be that your first reaction is to not want to do anything. You may find it hard to believe, especially if the family concerned doesn't fit in with common stereotypes of family violence.Once past your disbelief you may feel you want your child to have nothing to do with the situation. Cutting off all contact is one option, but it is not the only option.Cutting off may not be a very practical option if the children are good friends with lots of activities in common. Your child may find themselves torn between going along with what you want and loyalty to their friend. If they see you as an obstacle to their friendship, it may make it harder for them to ask you for help if they find they need it.You might try talking with your child about what they have seen. How did they feel about it? What does their friend say about it? Is that what they want for their own life? What do they think about that kind of behaviour?Let them know that you are concerned for their safety, and see if you can talk through the different possible ways of dealing with the situation together. Ask about their concerns. They may be worried that there will be consequences for their friend. They may worry that action you take will have a negative impact on the friendship itself.You and your child could agree that they see their friend at your place and on neutral territory. You could talk to Child, Youth and Family Services or to local community agencies about the situation. There are a range of possibilities and it is important to try to find options that will work, that will be safe, and that help your child to cope with a situation they may find very difficult.",  "id": "885"}
{"content": "Dating after a divorce can seem kind of intimidating. Not only have you been \u2018off the market\u2019 for a little while, but you probably have some baggage that you are carrying along with you. Because of this, most men are kind of shy about dating after they get divorced. Thing is, the longer you wait and the more you avoid it, the harder it is going to become for you to get out there and have a good time dating again.Here are 4 things that you need to know if you are dating again after a divorce:1. There are a lot of women that you are going to meet that are in the same position as you are.This is something that you always want to keep in mind, especially if you are a little self conscious about the fact that your marriage ended. Nowadays, it\u2019s not uncommon once you get past your twenties to end up meeting a lot of women who are in the same position that you are in. So, don\u2019t think that you have to be too secretive about the fact that you are back out there after getting divorced.2. How you approach a woman makes a huge difference in how she responds to you.If it has been a while since you have been out there and approaching women, then this is an area that you might want to work on. The approach sets everything up and if your approach is not up to snuff, don\u2019t expect fantastic results in the way that she responds to you. It\u2019s not that hard to get the approach right, but you definitely want to get it right.3. Don\u2019t dump all of your baggage on a woman right away.You might have a sad story about the way that your marriage ended and you might have a lot of mixed feelings about things, but you really do not want to dump them on a woman right away. There\u2019s nothing worse for a woman to go on a date with a guy and have it turn into a \u2018therapy session\u2019 about how his marriage ended.4. Always flirt with women to get your game back up to snuff.One of the easiest and most effective things that you can do to help yourself get back in the game is to flirt with women whenever you can. When you are out and about during your day, practice flirting with women, even if it ends up meaning nothing in the end. Get your game back up to snuff so that you can do well when you really want to get back out there",  "id": "886"}
{"content": "If you are like most single guys out there, then you probably are a little uneasy about approaching a woman you do not know. Approaching women who are complete strangers can be a tough thing for a guy to do, and because of this, most men either do not do it at all, or they start thinking that there must be some \u201csecret\u201d way to walk up to a woman and get her talking or get her number. The funny thing about it is, if you are searching for some secret way to walk up to a woman and WOW her in an instant, you are probably going to search FOREVER.While there are many things that you can do that will have an almost universal appeal with women, not all women are exactly the same. Now, that might seem like a pretty obvious statement, but you might be surprised at how many guys end up thinking that there is one way that fits all women. There\u2019s not. If you approach a woman the same way all of the time, it\u2019s not like you are ever going to end up with a 100 percent success rate. That\u2019s why you need to be able to adapt to situations, and read a woman, so that you can tell what she likes and what works on HER.Here are a few tips on approaching women that will help you to get it right, even if there is no \u201cright\u201d way:1. Before you walk on over to her, notice her mood.Most people wear their heart on their sleeves, meaning, it\u2019s kind of easy to tell what kind of a mood that they are in. This is important, because if you walk up to a woman when she is obviously having a bad day, you are not going to get the same reaction as you will when she is having a great day. Read her face, see how she is holding her body, see if she seems closed off. If she does, then you may even want to move on and forget about her.2. Start off slow, just to get her talking.It\u2019s a lot easier to read a woman when you have her talking. Cold reading is mostly a shot in the dark, though there are some tricks that you can use to get most of your guesses right. Still, it is much easier to read a woman when she is comfortable with you and talking and letting herself open up to you. If you start off too fast, then there is a lot better chance that you will end up getting it wrong, and making the wrong moves at the wrong time.3. Make sure that she sees that you are indeed confident in yourself.Confidence is one of the most powerful things to attract women, but it has to come off being real and not like you are trying to fake it. Women have a much different way of responding to a confident guy than they do when they know that a guy is unsure of himself. When you come off as being unsure of yourself, she knows that she has the \u201cpower\u201d in the situation and that is not always a good way to start things off.",  "id": "887"}
{"content": "Have you ever known a guy who was a serial dater? Meaning, it always seemed like he had a woman to date, no matter the time or the place? There are lots of guys like that out there, but they are still by far in the minority of men. Most guys struggle to get dates, and it almost doesn\u2019t seem fair that some guys, guys that look just like you- have no problems at all getting dates with women. How would you like to know what their secrets are?Now, you may not want to become a serial dater, you may not be interested in dating lots of women. Still, since most guys struggle to get dates and even just getting attention from women, it\u2019s probably not a bad idea to at least get a handle on what makes it so easy for them.Here are 3 secrets of serial daters that will get women to start paying attention to YOU:1. They know that it\u2019s all in the vibe that you project.Two guys can walk into a club looking basically the same, wearing the same clothes, and if they hold themselves differently, they are going to get different amounts of attention. The guy that projects the vibe that he is confident, fun to be around, and knows how to have a good time is almost always going to pull more female eyes his way than the guy that looks a little out of place, a little insecure. Project the right vibe and women pay attention.2. They know that it\u2019s not the clothes that make the man, it\u2019s the way that you wear the clothes.It\u2019s not nearly as important what kind of clothes you are wearing, it\u2019s whether or not you are wearing them with style. There\u2019s a big difference in just putting on an outfit and putting on a style. Style has pizzaz, it has flavor, it attracts eyes wherever it goes. That\u2019s what you need to do if you want to get women to pay attention to you.3. They know that when you break it down, it\u2019s a numbers game.Like I said, you may not be interested in becoming a player, a serial dater, or anything like that. Still, you have to know that it\u2019s a numbers game. When you know that it\u2019s a numbers game, you don\u2019t get hung up on just one woman.

{"content": "Home \u00bb Heart Health \u00bb Reduce Your Risk of 3 Serious Health Problems by Changing This One Habit\n\n\n\nWhat if we told you that you could reduce your risk of diabetes and heart disease by simply changing one daily habit? You probably wouldn\u2019t believe us, but one regular habit that many of us have has been linked to a higher risk of heart disease, diabetes, and obesity.So, what is this common habit that\u2019s putting our health at risk? It\u2019s TV watching.\nResearchers have linked prolonged TV watching \u2014 or a sedentary lifestyle \u2014 with a higher risk of heart disease, obesity, and diabetes. To reduce the harmful effects of prolonged sitting, it\u2019s advised that you get up for frequent moving breaks. So far, a sedentary lifestyle has been linked to accelerated aging, cancer, and blood clots.\nThe researchers at the University of Turku followed individuals who were transitioning from the workforce into retirement to determine if this transition could influence bad habits like prolonged sitting versus free time.\n\nThe researchers found that the daily amount of sitting increased over time from four to six hours and TV viewing also increased as a result. Sitting increases were seen higher among women, those who sat for their job, those with a low physical activity level, those who suffered from sleep disorders and mental health issues, and those who had poor health prior to retirement.\nThe simple answer to this problem is to simply sit less and move more, but for some people, this can be challenging. Therefore, if you are bound to sitting, then ensuring you\u2019re moving in this position can also help. For example, you can lift your arms or legs, wiggle your toes, and stretch. It\u2019s also a good idea while sitting to tap your feet on the ground as if you were running on the spot. You can do this for 30 seconds at a time.\nFinding ways to move more while sitting along with taking those necessary breaks to move around can help reduce the harmful effects of prolonged sitting.\n",  "id": "890"}
{"content": "The procedure of hair dyeing can radically change your image. But how to properly care for bright curls?Use hair care products specially designed for dyed hair. They prevent the washing of the paint and further moisturize the hair. As a rule, after coloring the hair becomes tougher. Balsams and conditioners for dyed hair make it softer and help restore the damaged structure.Try to wash your head with warm water! Using hot water results in a quick loss of color. You also need to take into account that red shades are washed away from hair faster.Try to use hair styling measures only when necessary - they aggregate the hair and make the color dull. Protect your hair from direct sunlight, because the dyed hair burns out in the sun much stronger.Use masks and rinse for hair based on folk recipes, they will strengthen your hair and add extra luster to it. For dyed hairs very useful honey masks, as well as a mask of black bread. Broths of wood, chamomile, hops can rinse hair with light shades.

{"content": "Manipulators, whether they know it or not, play on people\u2019s fears, doubts, and wishes. But their meanest method is playing on the higher feelings: love, gratitude, duty, and hope.However, you shouldn\u2019t become senseless and unsympathetic when trying to avoid manipulations.Now I've Seen Everything is here to share with you some of the most common tricks used by manipulators, as well as ways to stand up to them and protect your own interests.GuiltA person feeling guilty will do all it takes to compensate for the damage done by them. And that is exactly what the manipulator, imposing the feeling of guilt, needs.Are you really that guilty? And aren\u2019t you taking on too much by feeling responsible for another person\u2019s emotional state? His reaction is his choice. Even if you did something wrong, apologize sincerely, but never let the manipulator control you.Fear of losing faceA manipulator can provoke you not only for profit but also to amuse their ego, feel their power, or just have some fun. Victims are usually insecure people because their fear of losing face is the strongest.First, think whether you really need it. And don\u2019t fall for provocative statements \u2014 you are not stronger than you are, you are not almighty. And that\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of. You shouldn\u2019t put yourself at risk for the sake of preserving some dubious image.A sense of dutyA sense of duty is most commonly and most successfully abused by close relatives and friends. And they are the type of manipulators that can spoil your life the most.It\u2019s important to understand the limits of your abilities. You do have to help, but that doesn\u2019t automatically mean that you have to suffer and give up on your own needs. Of course, it\u2019s hard to turn down a close person. However, it is possible to find middle ground and help your friend or relative without hurting your own interests.Fear of being rejectedBy constantly blackmailing their partner, a manipulator gets lots of benefits for a promise to stay with them and love them back. They abuse their victim\u2019s fear of being rejected.Even if love can be bought, it can only be bought with love, not for any kind of material goods or endless services. It\u2019s important to learn to respect yourself. Never forget that you deserve selfless love and friendship.A sense of gratitudeA sense of gratitude can be abused endlessly with reminders about one service you\u2019ve done for that person every time you need something from them. And many manipulators, consciously or not, use this.If it\u2019s inconvenient for you to fulfill someone\u2019s request, you don\u2019t have to do it. Find a way to pay your friend back that is comfortable for you, and don\u2019t fall for unfair manipulations.PityThese sly dogs play on other peoples\u2019 kindness and compassion. They are usually not doing any worse than others, but they play on your feelings so masterfully that you become willing to help the unhappy fellow.Compliment the manipulator. If they try to shift their work to you, claiming they\u2019re suffering from it, tell them that such a talented person like them can do it much better than you, and you believe in them. Say it sincerely, and you will not only prevent manipulations but also make a good impression.Fear of lonelinessMany people stay with a rude person they don\u2019t love but just tolerate because they are afraid to become completely lonely. The manipulator lowers their victim\u2019s self-esteem, making it harder for them to escape the fear of loneliness and break free.Believe in yourself, respect yourself, and love yourself. That is the only way you can assess other people\u2019s attitude to you and avoid falling into the trap of fear of loneliness.ShameShame is an agonizing sense of inferiority and incorrectness of your actions. A person is usually willing to do all it takes to avoid this feeling, and that, of course, is masterfully abused by manipulators.If someone is diligently trying to shame you, you\u2019d better start worrying. Because if you\u2019ve made a mistake, you can apologize and correct it. And, of course, you shouldn\u2019t feel shame for not meeting someone\u2019s expectation. Your shame is only good for your manipulators to control you.HopeHope manipulations. The liar promises the moon to you and claims they will change their behavior in no time. But all they want are momentary benefits that the victim, touched by their good intentions, can give them.Don\u2019t believe their words. Look at their real actions. Set concrete deadlines, and make certain demands. Don\u2019t let hollow hopes change your thoughts and plans.VaingloryHow do vanity manipulations work? A basic example is the fable of the fox and the crow. It might seem like an innocent compliment, but what the manipulator really wants is not to please you.Before agreeing to the flatterer\u2019s request, evaluate your own interests, abilities, and wishes. And a nice \u201cYou\u2019re the only one capable of performing this task\u201c can be answered with \u201dThank you, it\u2019s a pleasure for me to hear that you think so.

However, if you do not want to give up such clothes, then wear it subtle - for example, under the netted tunics, wear a shirt without straps.Wide clothesOversize has been in the trend for several seasons, and for their cut are using softer and more relaxed silhouettes, rounded shoulders, fluttering skirts and wide sleeves similar to long-popular bat batches. However, the combination of wider shirts and broader cutters can visually add kilograms. A much better choice is the tight jeans in combination with some broad blouse.Impressive printsWe do not recommend wearing impressive prints if you want to look thinner. If you still want, then wear only one garment with a bold print in a blurred or earthy tone. Do not mix prints unless they are more open.Slits on the waist areaStraps with slits on the waist area are excellent for women with a sundial figure and prominent abdomen. However, women with a pear-shaped body or some pound should avoid these dresses. If you already have a desire for slippers, choose the one that reveals the hands and the upper part of the back.Yellow, bright orange, light purple, bright red and similar colorsBypass these widespread colors if you want to remove some kilograms from your clothes.

Eventually, their search was successful, and they were able to return Wilma to Guttfield.\n\nAmazon told CNBC that Wilma's dognapper will not be given an opportunity to strike again \u2014 at least not during an Amazon delivery.\n\"This is inexcusable and does not reflect the high standards we have for our delivery partners,\" a spokesperson said. \"We take these matters seriously and this individual is no longer delivering Amazon packages for the independent delivery service provider.\"\nWe assume Jeff Bezos now has a photo of Wilma framed on his desk.\n",  "id": "905"}

{"content": "You don't need to take the kids on a luxury cruise or go on a family expedition to the park just to play a few games of shuffleboard. You can actually play the game in your very own backyard. Here's a quick \"how to\" guide on creating your own shuffleboard area at home.Where to Buy MaterialsMuch of the necessary equipment for constructing a shuffleboard playing area is available via online stores or your local DIY outlet. Shuffleboards, weights and wax to talc and shakers, can be found online from an online Shuffleboard shop (check out shuffleboard federation for reliable retailers).How To Build the Shuffleboard AreaFirst, measure out the space available to determine the type of table suitable for your purpose. Then select a table and clear the space so the table can sit flat on the area. Tables generally range in size from 9 to 22 feet and vary in price (from about $800 upwards). They are made from many types of materials, from all-weather products to quality woods. If you live in an area with frequent rain or snow, you may want to consider putting the shuffleboard play area together under a covering or into a rec room / games room. Alternatively there's always the court type shuffleboard playing area which is more of a do-it-yourself approach. Simply create a court area by paving the ground and rolling out a shuffleboard plastic cover which you can by at most retailers from about $90.Playing the GameIf you remember the rules of shuffleboard - you're all set ... just explain it to your kids and have fun. Otherwise download a simple guide to shuffleboard from the net and read up on the rules, then explain to your kids. Shuffleboard is a fantastic family and party game that you can play over many years (once you've got the equipment). It's also still quite rare to have in your backyard ... so if you want to impress your neighbors and friends - Shuffleboard is it!",  "id": "909"}
{"content": "I doubt that there is a man alive who wants to get rejected by a woman.  It has to be one of the most common dating fears that men have,  even if it doesn\u2019t usually get talked about too much.  When it does happen,  you probably start to find yourself trying to figure out WHY it happened and if there is anything that you can do so that it doesn\u2019t happen to you again.  I have read many of the theories that some dating advice experts hand out,  and while some of them are spot on,  some of them are actually way off base as to why men get rejected by women.  It can all be summed up in ONE SENTENCE.She doesn\u2019t feel attracted to you.Here are 2 reasons why she might not feel that attraction that she needs to feel for you:1. She feels like you are way too needy or way too clingy and she doesn\u2019t like that one bit.Most women don\u2019t want to date a guy who is going to act like he needs to be around her all of the time.  Most women want men who know how to do their own thing and don\u2019t need her support to feel good.  Plain and simple,  most women want to meet guys who act like guys and when you come across as being way too clingy or needy -  she starts to question how much of a \u201cman\u201d you really are.  You don\u2019t want her to question that at all.2. You use the wrong methods or techniques to try and make her attracted to you.Like it or not,  if you are using the WRONG methods or techniques to try and make a woman feel attracted to you,  then it\u2019s not going to happen.  You can\u2019t expect it to.  This is why it is so important that you learn the RIGHT methods for making a woman feel attracted to you.  Otherwise,  you can\u2019t get too net out of shape when you find that nothing you are doing is working.There are plenty more reasons why women will reject a guy,  but if you can work on the above 2 reasons,  you should be a lot better off than most men are.  Of course,  you may want to discover more advanced ways to make a woman want you.",  "id": "910"}
{"content": "When it comes to dating and meeting women, mindset is about the biggest obstacle that most guys have. There are tons of different techniques that you can learn that will help you get better results, but nothing will give you the quantum leap that changing your mindset about dating and attracting women will. Pay close attention, because just a simple shift in the way that you think about things can bring you drastically different results.Here are some tips on how to attract women with the right mindset:1. Pursue women to enhance your life, not to fill voids.When most guys pursue a woman, it\u2019s because they are lonely or sad and they think that by meeting the right woman, they will suddenly feel fulfilled and happy. Well, that might work temporarily, but it will also work against you. For one, you are going to give off the wrong kind of vibe if you are trying to fill a void. And two, you are basically setting yourself up to be emotionally dependent on a woman, which is a recipe for disaster. Instead of trying to fill a void, you want to have the mindset where women will enhance an already good life.2. You want to feel as though there is no reason why a woman would reject you.Now, of course, you never can have a 100 percent success rate. But, most guys approach women with the mindset that she probably will reject them unless they flatter her and suck up and try their best to show her that they will treat her like a princess. Instead, you want to have the mindset where you feel as though you are in control of the situation, there is no reason she would reject you, and if she does, then the reason probably has to do more with her and not with you.3. Never feel as though women are scarce.Look around sometime, really open your eyes and see how many attractive women there are. When you pursue women as though they are scarce, you will end up putting up with behaviors that you normally wouldn\u2019t all because you feel as though you have to. For example, guys that feel they really are limited when it comes to meeting women are usually the ones that end up spending lots of money, putting up with a woman\u2019s crazy mood swings, and acting like a doormat. Women are not scarce, there are lots of them out there. Keep that in mind when pursuing women.",  "id": "911"}

{"content": "At the Berkshire 2018 Conference, Buffett and Munger discussed their discussion in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and whether they approve of the company buybacks. See below for an informal transcript on that topic.\nAlso Berkshire 2018 Conference on\n\nWe\u2019ve got a handful of questions relating to Apple. This is a bit of a mash up of a couple of them. Warren you have bought in in and sold out of IBM. You have praised Jeff Bezos but never bought Amazon and you have doubled down on Apple. Can you tell us what it is about Apple and given your sometimes critical views on buybacks. Do you think Apple would do better spending a hundred billion dollars on buybacks or buying other productive businesses the way you have generally preferred. A hundred billion dollars is a lot of money. I used to think some the Apple has a incredible consumer product which you understand a lot better than I do whether they should buy their shares and they shouldn\u2019t buy any shares at all unless they think that they\u2019re selling for less than they\u2019re worth. And if they are selling less than they\u2019re worth and they have the money and they don\u2019t see an acquisition that\u2019s even more attractive. They should buy in their shares and I think that that\u2019s very. Because I think it\u2019s extremely hard to find acquisitions that would be a accreted to Apple would be in the 50 or 100 billion and 200 billion dollar range. They do a lot of small acquisitions. And you know I\u2019m delighted to see them repurchasing shares we own let\u2019s say we own 200 million or so shares. They have I think 4 billion 923 million or something like that.\nAnd mentally you can say we own 5 percent of it but I figure when you go with the passage of a little time we may own 6 or 7 percent simply because they repurchase shares. And I find that got an extraordinary product in that ecosystem and there\u2019s lots to be done. I love the idea of having our 5 percent or whatever it may be grow to 6 or 7 percent without us laying out a dime. I mean it worked for us in many other situations. But you have to have some very very very special product and which has an enormous wide enormously widespread ecosystem and are products extremely sticky and all of that sort of thing. And they\u2019re not going to find 50 or 100 billion dollar acquisitions that they can make it remotely a sensible price that really become a matter of that that they may they may find it who knows. But there certainly as I look around the horizon I don\u2019t see anything that would make a lot of sense for them in terms of what they\u2019d have to pay and what they would get. Whereas I do see a business that they know everything about and where they may or may not be able to buy it at an attractive price when they repurchase their shares. That remains to be seen. Incidentally that\u2019s one thing that I always enjoy people people say well you\u2019re talking your book or something if you talk from our standpoint we would love to see Apple go down in price. That they\u2019re going to well just put it this way. If Andrew and Charlie and I were partners in a business that was worth three million dollars. So each of us had a million dollar interest and Andrew offered to sell out his one third interest at 800000. And we had the money around.\nWe jumped at the chance to buy him out. I mean it\u2019s so simple but people get all lost. And if he want a million do for it we wouldn\u2019t pay it to him. It\u2019s it\u2019s very simple math but it gets lost in all these discussions. And of course like I say Tim Cook can do simple math and probably do very complicated math too. So we very much approve of them repurchasing shares.\nCHARLIE\nI think generally speaking in America when companies go out hellbender by other companies they do that they\u2019re worth less after the transaction is made than they were before. So I don\u2019t think you have a general way to wealth for American corporations to go out and buy other corporations averaged out. It\u2019s a way down not up. And I think that a great many places have nothing better to do than to buy their own stock and nothing is advantageous to do as big as buying a stock.\nSo I think we know pretty damn well what\u2019s going to happen to Apple. They\u2019ll be very lucky to if there was something available to a low price that they could buy. I don\u2019t think the world is that easy. I think that the reason these companies are buying their stock is that is that they\u2019re smart enough to know that it\u2019s better for them. Anything else that does not mean we approve of every buyback at all. I mean we\u2019ve shown I think some people just it to keep the stock up and that of course is insane and immoral.

Think the constant typing on the laptop or messaging on the phone.And some of these people have been advised complete rest from computers and phones because they are suffering from a little known condition called carpal tunnel syndrome. \u201cCarpal tunnel syndrome is more common among people who use computer systems and keyboards excessively,\u201d says Dr PR Krishnan, consultant neurologist at Fortis Hospital, Bangalore.What\u2019s carpal tunnel syndrome, and do you have it?It\u2019s a condition that causes intense pain, numbness and tingling in your arms. \u201cThe condition occurs when the median nerve is compressed as it travels across the wrist. Some of the symptoms to watch out for are numbness and tingling of fingers, weakness of wrist, occasional shock like feeling that travels through your fingers,\u201d says Dr Krishnan.The other symptoms include: weakness of hands, i.e. whenever you try to lift something, you end up dropping it and pain that travels from forearm to shoulder.It is important to note that carpal tunnel may not be directly caused by repetitive activities such as playing a musical instrument, playing a sport or typing. But these activities may cause tendinitis in the hand, which can narrow the carpal tunnel and lead to the symptoms.It is best to get yourself checked if you\u2019ve experienced any of these symptoms.Things to do to avoid this conditionTake breaks, exercise: According to Dr Krishnan taking a 3-5 minute break every hour will help. \u201cAttempt hand and wrist exercises often.

I'm David Kingo global manager in Shanghai. I've been here for eight years. This is for many us the Olympics. You are my champion team. So my question is that fast-growing machine. Halogens how do you see the new competition (of machines) impact the capital allocation. Productivity in the future for Charlie. What is the first principle of capital allocation front inaudible or economic interest points of view? Thank you. Well, two questions.\nMachine intelligence I'm afraid the only intelligence I have as proof is being provided by something that's not a machine and I don't think I'm going to learn machine intelligence. If you ask me how to beat the game or go with my own intelligence I couldn't do it. And I think it's too old for me to learn computer science generally. I think that the machine intelligence has worked. After all the machine now can beat the best human player go. B\nut I think there's more hype in that field than it is probable and cheap and so I don't think the world is going to change that much by machine intelligence some but not hugely. And what was the other question? What was machine intelligence was getting a capital allocation?\nOh yeah that's such a general question. Generally speaking we're always trying to get the best to get something that's worth buying and the human mind rejects that. If you're in academia, you could come in and make one declare three cents at the opening of the semester and you're dying to do for the rest of your time.\nSo we will want to find some formula. It's what I call physics envy. These people want the world to be like physics but the world isn't like physics outside of physics. And that false precision just does nothing but get you in trouble. So I would I would say you got to master the general ideas and you've got other work to improve your judgment slowly. All the rest of us had and I don't think most individuals have much hope of individual gain from machine intelligence.\nI don't think that I'm impressed with machines goal or something of the shorter or even when the chess or whatever it may be I don't really think they'd bring much to the table regarding capital allocation or investing. And I maybe I'm missing something entirely and maybe I'm just blind to what's out there.

{"content": "Crazy myths about the fast food industry have spread like wildfire among many people throughout the last several years. From the beef used in Taco Bell\u2019s food to the content of shakes at McDonald\u2019s, countless people have fell for unbelievable myths about the nature of fast food. Fortunately, a lot of the infamous myths have been proven to be false. Some have been debunked by popular fast food companies themselves. Find out what is really true about fast food. The facts may surprise you!Myth: The Incorruptible HamburgerFact: According to McDonald\u2019s Canada, McDonald\u2019s hamburgers do tend to dry out instead of rot, yet this is not due to the use of chemicals that make the hamburgers \u201cincorruptible\u201d. In reality, the hamburgers just do not have much moisture in them after the cooking process, and leaving them in the open air reduces more moisture. Otherwise, the hamburgers would rot like any other fast food hamburger.Myth: Dine-In Restaurants Are Healthier Than Fast Food RestaurantsFact: A Drexel study exposed that dine-in establishments do not always serve food that is always healthier than fast food restaurants. In reality, a full meal at a sit-down restaurant can lead one to pack on more calories than one needs in a whole day. Compare that to a fast food combo meal with more calories than needed for just one meal.Myth: Salads Are Always A Healthy OptionFact: Although it may naturally seem as though salads are consistently the safe option at fast food joints, the Consumerist has proved this to be wrong. Since fast food salads typically have more cheese, meat, and salad dressing than is needed, they are no better than the greasy, salty, and sweet options available to eat. Salads can often have more fat, sugar, and sodium than other fast food items.Myth: Fast Food Is CheapFact: Many people do consider fast food to be cheaper than preparing food at home, but this is not even true. According to a NY Times article, feeding a family of four a typical meal from McDonald\u2019s can cost over $20. On the other hand, one can prepare a meal for a family of four at home for close to $10. It depends on how one shops at grocery stores.Myth: Darker Roasted Coffee Has More CaffeineFact: If you are a big coffee lover, you probably believe that darker roasted coffee contains more caffeine than lighter roasted coffee. In reality, the darker roasted coffee at your local Starbucks is not as buzzworthy as you may think. Coffee beans start off green and become darker through the roasting process. The longer coffee beans are roasted, the more caffeine is depleted from them. This means darker coffee beans have less caffeine, according to a Washington Post article.Myth: Chicken McNuggets Are Made Of Pink SlimeFact: The rumor of McDonald\u2019s Chicken McNuggets being made with pink slime was proven to be untrue. According to McDonald\u2019s, the Chicken McNuggets are made with USDA inspected boneless white chicken meat. There was even a video prepared to show the process of making them (and no pink slime was used). It can be viewed online.Myth: White Castle\u2019s Onions Are Not Onions At AllFact: People fell for the belief that White Castle\u2019s onions were actually pieces of cabbage soaked in onion juice. This is not factual. Real onions are used on their hamburgers, known as Sliders, along with pickles. They prefer to keep it simple with real ingredients, which is noted on their website.Myth: McShakes Are Made With Pig FatFact: In reality, the signature shakes at McDonald\u2019s are prepared using a pre-made mix that does contain dairy, not pig fat. Animal meat/fat is not listed as one of the ingredients of the McShakes on the McDonald\u2019s menu, according to McDonald\u2019s UK.Myth: The Taco Meat Is Only 35 Percent BeefFact: Along with this ridiculous Taco Bell myth comes the belief that the taco meat is Grade D and unfit for humans to eat, despite it being sold to millions every day. Taco Bell cleared this up by informing the public that their meat is 88 percent beef and 12 percent fillers. The fillers are included to give the meat the color and texture it has, but it is safe to consume.Myth: Mutant Chickens Are On The MenuFact: Some people have described the chicken served to customers by Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) to be genetically modified. The reality is that KFC uses high-quality poultry that people buy at supermarkets every day, not mutant chickens, which was debunked by KFC. This rumor, like many others, has been circulating around for years.",  "id": "956"}

{"content": "Despite a series of pay rises over the years, Hong Kong\u2019s judiciary is still suffering from a manpower crunch, with 50 of the city\u2019s 214 positions on the bench left vacant between last April and this March.\nThe shortage was most severe in the lower courts, with 36 of 109 permanent magistrate positions unoccupied, compared with 31 vacancies in the previous 12-month period. At the High Court, seven out of 34 posts were not filled, the same as the previous year, according to a government paper submitted to lawmakers last week.\nJustice Mohan Bharwaney, who was a senior counsel before he became a High Court judge in 2011, said despite higher pay and the practice of reappointing retired judges for shorter periods, the judiciary was \u201cvery far away\u201d from tackling its manpower shortage. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a function of economics, because the senior counsel who are fit and proper to be appointed to the High Court are earning so much money in practice,\u201d Bharwaney said. \nThe paper showed that High Court judges earn upwards of HK$292,650 (US$37,280) each month with those in the Court of Appeal earning upwards of HK$307,050. But top-tier senior counsel could earn more than double those amounts.\nBharwaney said that to get more established legal eagles to the bench, \u201cit would be great if some senior counsels would wake up to the fact that you have to give back to the society which has given much to you\u201d.\nHe described being a judge as requiring a \u201clarge element of public service\u201d.\nTwo years ago, judges across the board were given a pay rise of 4.85 per cent with additional medical and other benefits but legal experts warned this would do little to close the gap. \nThey suggested other ways of ensuring a steady pipeline of judges, for example, by imbuing young lawyers with a sense of duty, so they would aim to join the bench later in their career.\nFormer Bar Association chairwoman, Winnie Tam Wan-chi, who was previously a deputy High Court judge, said restricting retired judges from returning to private practice was putting off talented individuals and should be scrapped. Currently, those who want to join a private firm after stepping down from the bench must first seek the Hong Kong chief executive\u2019s permission.\n\u201cIt is a pity to retire someone at the age of 65 and not give them any way to return to the legal profession and practice,\u201d Tam said. \u201cWith such an abrupt ending to one\u2019s professional life, many would be hesitant to join the bench.\u201d\nThe Legco paper also revealed a mixed report card for the judiciary\u2019s performance in processing court cases. \nLast year, defendants whose criminal trials were at the District Court found themselves waiting an average of five months between the first mention of the case and the start of the hearing, two months more than the year before. This was because more District Court judges were sent to the High Court to hear criminal appeals.\nAnd while the average time taken from the filing of criminal charges to the first hearing at the High Court was reduced by half from almost 10 months to just over five months, it still fell short of the judiciary\u2019s service pledge for the process to take 120 days. \nIn general, waiting time for civil trials to begin also increased, but the courts showed improvement in the time taken to conclude commercial and civil trials and hand down verdicts. \nHowever, this was not the case for tribunal and miscellaneous appeals, including judicial reviews, with courts taking an average of two months last year to deliver judgments, up from 36 days the year before. \nThe paper noted the Chief Judge of the High Court was \u201cfully aware of the situation \u2026 and is making every effort\u201d to give judges more time to write their judgments, in view of the manpower shortage, while balancing this with the need to process cases within a \u201creasonable\u201d time frame.\n  ",  "id": "962"}

{"content": "It\u2019s a situation that you really would not wish on anyone. You think about her all of the time, and not in any way, shape or form as just a friend. Problem is, she does not know it, or at least it does not seem like she knows it. Being in love with a female friend is not an easy position to be stuck in, and when you just cannot take it anymore, you have to admit that you need to find a way to make her fall for you or move on.What happens to most guys is, they just don\u2019t want to risk losing the \u201cdream\u201d of her. It\u2019s not that they don\u2019t want to lose her, as much as they don\u2019t want to lose the hope and the possibility that one day she will finally feel the same way. I\u2019ve known guys that were friends with a woman for ten years, and nothing changed, and they stayed in love with her the whole time. Ten years! You do not want to stay stuck on the same woman for ten years, do you?Here are some tips that you can use to make your female friend become your lover:1. There has to be a time buffer between you and her.What I mean by this is, in order for you to change the way that she feels about you, there has to be some time where you transition from being her friend to being someone who wants more. And to do that effectively, you need to take some time away from her. As good as it might feel to be around her all of the time, if you don\u2019t take that time away, it\u2019s going to be tough to make her change the way that she sees you.2. You need to work a little on the way that you act around women.During your little time away from her, you want to work on flirting with women a little more, getting used to being around women that you are attracted to without going straight into friend mode. The good thing about this is, since you are not going to be attached to any woman that you flirt with during this time, you can kind of experiment with what works and what doesn\u2019t work. That way, when you start to woo your female friend, you will know what to do and what to stay away from.3. Call her up to hang out and show off the \u201cnew\u201d you.After spending some time away from her and polishing up your game so that you know how to flirt with a woman so that she responds the way you want her to, call up your female friend and get her to hang out. Don\u2019t ask her on a date, because she will probably think that is weird. She has to see the new you, and she has to start feeling different, and that will only happen if you can get her alone with you. Once you do, start flirting with her, and whatever you do, do NOT go back to buckling and doing whatever she wants and being that kind of guy friend that never gets anywhere with a woman.",  "id": "974"}

{"content": "Last night's episode of Saturday Night Live distilled the legal disarray rattling Trump's White House into an appropriately chaotic cold open. It featured Alec Baldwin's Trump, with Ben Stiller returning as embattled lawyer Michael Cohen, and depicted the pair making phone calls to a bevy of Trump-world acolytes.The sketch begins with Stiller phoning Baldwin and his newest incompetent advisor, Rudy Giuliani (Kate McKinnon), who Baldwin-as-Trump praises as \"the sharpest legal mind since My Cousin Vinny.\"  Once they're all on a three-way call, Stiller begs them to \"decide on one lie and stick to it.\"Stiller's machinations are interrupted by accidental calls to Leslie Jones as former White House aide Omarosa Manigault and Martin Short as Trump doctor Harold Bornstein. (The doctor recently admitted that Trump wrote his own glowing health assessment in 2015, which Bornstein then signed.) \"I have zero commitments, personally or professionally,\" says Short.  \"But if you ever want to do drugs, I can get you all the drugs.\"Stiller and Baldwin are then phoned by Aidy Bryant as Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Cecily Strong as Melania Trump, before Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner (Scarlett Johansson and Jimmy Fallon) hop on the line. Finally, Stormy Daniels herself takes a call with the Baldwin and Stiller. \"Are you alone?\" Stiller asks Daniels.\"And what are you wearing?\" Baldwin interjects. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",  "id": "982"}

{"content": "Avengers: Infinity War hit yet another box office milestone this weekend.\nOn Saturday, the latest Marvel Cinematic Universe adventure crossed the billion-dollar mark at the worldwide box office. It took just 11 days to reach that point, faster than any other film to date.\n\nIt's Marvel's sixth billion-dollar movie and Disney's seventeenth \u2014 meaning the studio's releases now officially account for half of the 34 movies to ever hit $1 billion at the box office. The weekend also makes Infinity War ($1.16 billion) the #5 super-hero movie of all time at the global box office, behind four other MCU releases.\nIn the U.S., the latest Avengers took in and estimated $112.5 million during its second weekend. It's only the fifth film in Hollywood history to makes more than $100 million in its second weekend. Perhaps even more impressively, the overall domestic box office of $451 million makes Infinity War the #15 highest domestic box office earner of all time.\nThis is a popular movie.\nThe question is, will it last? To use a current example, Infinity War audiences are so far drifting away faster than Black Panther moviegoers. Roughly 56 percent of the audience dropped off from the first weekend to the second, compared to a much smaller 45 percent for Panther.\nThat said, we only have a small sample size to work with so far. The big test for Infinity War's ultimate box office performance will be how it fares in weeks three, four, five, and on. It has a good shot at topping Black Panther's domestic total of $693.1 million (and counting, as the movie is still in theaters), but nothing is assured.\nFor one, Infinity War is a long movie. At two hours and 40 minutes, it's got the MCU's longest running time to date. That kind of time commitment \u2014 especially when you factor in trailers, ticket purchases, and schlepping to and from the theater \u2014 only hurts the prospects of the audience signing up for repeat viewings.\nWhat's more, Infinity War is only half of a two-part story while also serving as the culmination of an arc that the MCU has been building up to for the past 10 years. For all of its positive qualities, it's an unwieldy beast that lacks any sense of immediate closure.\nCompare that to Black Panther, a relatively self-contained story with a clear beginning, middle, and end. Its ability to stand alone also means it has much broader appeal, as audiences can walk in knowing they don't need 10 years of movie history in their head to fully enjoy what they're seeing.\nBeyond all of that, it's also the spring/summer release season: Infinity War is weeks away from competing with mega-blockbusters like Deadpool 2, Solo: A Star Wars Story, and Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. Meanwhile, Black Panther \u2014 a February release \u2014 had a clear runway for more than a month before any viable competitors came along.\nNone of this is meant as a knock on Infinity War, which is a great Avengers movie in its own right and one that serves the fan community well. But there are plenty of obstacles to Infinity War reaching the domestic box office success of some of its predecessors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",  "id": "984"}

TSLA\u2019s a \u201cbattery company,\u201d right? And what about the \u201cGigafactory\u201d? \u2022 Tesla\u2019s battery cells are made by Panasonic\n\u2022 Panasonic\u2019s so-called \u201cinvestment\u201d in the Gigafactory is really a capital lease of its equipment to TSLA\n\u2022 TSLA uses a small cylindrical cell that- because it\u2019s expensive to assemble into packs- has been obsoleted by new, larger format cells; no other major auto maker even wants to use them\n\u2022 Panasonic happily sells those larger cells to Tesla\u2019s competitors\n\u2022 Because of Tesla\u2019s locked-in purchase commitments to Panasonic, it may now be paying significantly more for batteries than its competitors\nModel 3 Math\n\u2022 A base Model 3 would cost Tesla at least mid-$40,000s to build, so it can either sell them at a gigantic loss starting @ $35,000 or\u2014 as it\u2019s doing now @ $49,000\u2014 mandate a larger battery + other options and thus price them into a much smaller market segment.\n\u2022 In fact, Tesla recently acknowledged that it won\u2019t make any $35,000 Model 3s until at least late 2018/early 2019, and I predict they won\u2019t build more than a tiny handful at that price, just to claim they \u201cdid it.\u201d\n\u2022 Bernstein estimates that &lt;30% of current Tesla owners with Model 3 reservations completed their orders when invited to do so; forums indicate that the percentage among non-Tesla owners is much lower.\n\u2022 Besides a massive number of Tesla forum posts indicating that the Model 3 is a lemon, its touchscreen-only interface means operating it is the dangerous equivalent of texting-while-driving\nTons of competition for Tesla in EV market (listed in slide deck)\nA massive number of long-range electric cars will soon be on the market, often at prices subsidized by profits from their makers\u2019 conventional vehicles, an option Tesla doesn\u2019t have. Additionally, here in the U.S. Tesla\u2019s $7500 tax credits will expire in late 2018 while competitors will just be starting to use theirs, so pricing pressure on TSLA will be intense.

But between spot-on comedic turns and two versatile musical performances, he\u2019s definitely staked a claim to be counted among the very best of the bunch.As Childish Gambino, Glover performed two new but very different songs. The first song, \"Saturday,\" is an irresistible R&amp;B throwback, a Michael Jackson-style late-disco gem. His next musical performance found Gambino hopping genres and decades with \"This is America,\" a Kendrick-esque political rap anthem. In the music video, also released Saturday, Glover pivots between dancing gleefully and committing horrifying violence, shooting a black guitarist in the head before mowing down a joyful gospel choir. The video juxtaposes black peoples' status as America\u2019s foremost cultural producers, creating music and dance styles that are consumed the world over, with our status as the victims of some of the nation's most brutal crimes. Glover depicts the \u201cacceptable\u201d face of black America\u2014choirs and neatly-dressed school children and Glover himself, singing and dancing in audience-pleasing routines\u2014but weds it to the gruesome violence also committed against us, violence from which the world often prefers to turn away. \"Get your money, black man,\" is the sung refrain, invoking icons like Jay-Z who suggest would suggest that capitalism is the route to black freedom.

However, the different rules for handling different types of meat can be confusing. It may be perfectly safe to eat some meat a week after it was prepared or to freeze it for later. Other types should be thrown away after only a few days.Safety issues are associated with everything you may eat. A healthy kitchen depends on your knowledge of safe cooking and storage practices.Never buy meat that\u2019s past the expiration or sell-by date. Also, buy meats at the store after you\u2019ve found all your other items to decrease the time the meat is out of refrigeration.Follow these specific guidelines when selecting certain meats:Avoid any beef or pork that\u2019s dark brown or discolored, has a strong odor, or feels tough or slimy.Avoid any poultry that looks faded, has a strong odor, or feels tough or slimy.Avoid any fish that\u2019s faded or discolored, has squishy or slimy flesh, and has a strong fishy or ammonia-like odor.Avoid any meat that\u2019s in damaged, leaking, or torn packages, as it\u2019s likely been exposed to the air and harmful bacteria.Handling meatWash your hands frequently when preparing any type of meat, fish, or poultry. Bacteria can quickly spread between your hands and meat. Always wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds before and after handling meat, whether it\u2019s raw or cooked.Because bacteria can spread easily, prepare the meat on a surface that\u2019s separate from all other cooking materials. Keep vegetables and other ingredients away from meat, especially if you aren\u2019t cooking them together in the same dish.Try to use separate cutting boards, clean all cooking utensils after they touch raw meat, and use different utensils to serve food after you\u2019ve prepared it.Storing meatUncured, raw meat generally lasts safely for around three days in the refrigerator. If you plan to keep uncooked meat longer, freezing it is your best bet. Seal the meat in an airtight package before freezing. Then, it can usually be frozen for at least several months.Safe freezing and refrigeration time also depends on the storage temperature. Keep your freezer as close to 0\u00b0F (-17.8\u00b0C) as possible. This helps retain nutrients and keep food fresh. Keep your refrigerator at around 34\u00b0F (1.1\u00b0C), just above freezing, to effectively prolong the shelf life of foods.",  "id": "998"}
