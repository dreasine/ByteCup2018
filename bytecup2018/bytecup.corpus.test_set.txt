{"content": "Aug. 04--There was a certain irony for the Bears on Thursday night as they prepared to face the Ravens in the Hall of Fame Game. There was Brian Urlacher, once the heartbeat of the defense, an eight-time Pro Bowl selection and now a Hall of Famer, going from player to player with high-fives and words of encouragement.Urlacher, an elite member of the franchise's long linebacker lineage, was receiving his latest acknowledgement for his big weekend at the Pro Football Hall of Fame.Yet the young linebacker expected to begin the next chapter of defensive dominance for the Bears was nowhere to be found, not around to grasp the significance of Urlacher's presence.Roquan Smith, who was drafted No. 8 in April -- one slot ahead of where Urlacher was picked in 2000 -- has yet to sign his rookie contract. He hasn't reported to training camp and hasn't been able to begin practicing with his team.Urlacher shrugged Friday afternoon when asked about Smith's ongoing absence and a contract melodrama that has killed some of the summer buzz around the team.\"It's a business deal,\" Urlacher said. \"That's the way it goes. Sometimes these things happen. I don't think it's his issue. I don't think it's the Bears' decision for this to happen. But let's see where it goes.\"Eighteen years ago, as a top-10 pick and a player expected to help revive the Bears defense, Urlacher made certain to report to camp on time. He told his agent he wanted no part of a holdout, in big part because he needed to learn to play linebacker after spending the latter part of his college career at New Mexico as a safety.\"I can't speak for other people, but I told my agent: 'I will not miss camp. I'll be in there. Even if we sign the day before, I will not miss camp at all. I think it's detrimental to me learning the defense and (helping) my teammates.' We made sure we got it done in time.\"Urlacher stayed true to his word, won Defensive Rookie of the Year honors in 2000 and went on to enjoy a storied career that has led him this weekend to the Hall of Fame.Perhaps Smith can enjoy a similar journey when he finally signs and joins the Bears on the field. Still, Urlacher said, the rookie should not be concerned with any lofty expectations or comparisons as his arrival inevitably sparks references to Urlacher, Mike Singletary, Dick Butkus and Bill George.\"There shouldn't be any pressure, shouldn't be any comparisons,\" Urlacher said. \"There are no comparisons. It's like what I said when people asked me that question (as a young player). It's not fair to Butkus, to Singletary, to Bill George to compare me to them. I'm not them. I was me. I didn't think it was fair to them. They were in the Hall of Fame at that time.\"Urlacher now is too.Smith's career arc is yet to be seen. But he'll have to find a way to erase the frustrations that have come from his holdout.dwiederer@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "2"}
{"content": "If Wall Street's job is to provide guidance before key moments for companies, then they are falling asleep at the wheel on the volatile Tesla (TSLA) .  Who can blame many analysts for being non-commital on Tesla's stock into earnings on Wednesday. One outrageous comment by Tesla CEO Elon Musk on the earnings call (like he made on the first quarter call) could send the stock in the toilet come Thursday morning. That would be in addition to the inevitable concerns from the report about Tesla's cash position. Why bother going out on the limb with a Tesla call a mere months removed from holiday bonus season?  Here's a great example of some last-minute mixed research on Tesla into earnings via CFRA: \"With the shares below our 12-month target price of $300, we raise our opinion to Hold. We will update our perspective on TSLA after their expected report on 8/1 after the close. Regardless of Q2 results, we expect ongoing share price volatility, as the bulls and bears battle. We expect to see production rates progress in Q3 beyond the 5,000 per week rate hit at Q2-end, as the company moves towards projected sustained non-GAAP profitability as early as 2019. We think Elon Musk's short-term goal of Q3 and Q4 GAAP profitability is neither sustainable nor necessary, but a distraction from what is really important - steadily rising production Model 3 volume with improving profit margins and self-supporting cash flow. Meanwhile, we still forecast a capital raise in Q1 2019 to support existing operations and growth initiatives.\" Among the 34 analysts on Wall Street that cover the money-losing Tesla, 10 rate the stock a buy despite the prospect for endless losses and cash burn.

{"content": "July 31--Cubs pitcher Jon Lester weighed in about the rash of ugly tweets from MLB players that recently have been exposed.Some of it was sage advice. \"Spend the 5 minutes it takes to scrub your account.\" \"Don't say stupid things in the first place.\" It's what every parent should tell their teenage kids.But some of his advice missed the point. \"I know some of these guys are great dudes who just had lapses in judgement. ... Too many young guys are getting burned.\"Lester's perspective on these racist, homophobic and misogynistic tweets has been a common reaction. The focus has been on the negative publicity, the embarrassment caused to the player or the supposed unfairness of having past tweets deliberately uncovered.Suggesting that athletes scrub their social media accounts is treating a symptom, not the disease.Far too often that's how we as a country deal with racism, sexism or homophobia.\"You can't say that out loud\" is something you probably have heard someone tell a friend who blurted an offensive phrase. \"You can't talk like that in public.\"Less common is the advice to examine and try to change our biased views. I've heard almost nobody discuss the ramifications these tweets have on teammates or fans who are the targets of slurs.There has been far less focus on the culture in baseball, which has a history of racism. There have been few calls for MLB to develop better anti-bias training for players.There need to be more voices like Nationals pitcher Sean Doolittle.\"It's a privilege to play in the major leagues and we have an obligation to leave the game better than we found it,\" he tweeted Monday. \"There's no place for racism, insensitive language or even casual homophobia. I hope we can learn from this and make the MLB a place where all our fans feel welcome.\"Sports fans are too eager to absolve athletes. Look no further than the standing ovation Brewers pitcher Josh Hader received when he pitched after his tweets of \"I hate gay people,\" \"KKK\" and \"white power\" were revealed.Braves pitcher Sean Newcomb and shortstop Trea Turner also have had offensive tweets unearthed.Excusing away abhorrent language because of youth or stupidity diminishes the impact of hateful language. Why are we quick to assume these players all had epiphanies when they reached their wise-old early 20s?These players shouldn't be suspended. Rather they should explain how their thinking has evolved. They should seek anti-bias training and talk to people affected by discrimination.Fans should listen to Doolittle: \"We have to start caring as much about the content of the posts as we do about when they were made and how they came to light.\"sryan@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "4"}
{"content": "July 27--Some sound-reducing windows installed in homes near the city's airports may smell like burning plastic, but they are not unhealthy, according to the Chicago Department of Aviation.Tests done by industrial experts hired by the city confirmed previous results in finding no evidence of health risks in connection with the windows, the city said Thursday.Experts also determined that the main source of the odors is the polyvinyl chloride-coated screens, combined with high temperatures, the city said. The city is recommending that homeowners experiencing odors remove the screens until it can come up with a more permanent solution to be implemented this fall.\"We're moving our attention to working on a mitigation solution for the community,\" said Erin O'Donnell, managing deputy commissioner of Midway Airport. Most of the reports of problems with the windows came from homeowners near Midway.The Aviation Department has received 1,058 complaints about bad smells from windows, especially on hot days, and city workers have confirmed the odors in 612 homes, O'Donnell said. The city has installed sound-reducing windows, doors and other materials on more than 21,000 homes near Midway and O'Hare International Airport since 1995.Homeowners said they worried that the vinyl windows might pose a health risk.Industrial hygiene expert Wood, formerly known as Amec Foster Wheeler, and architectural testing expert Intertek-ATI provided the findings. Intertek looked at the design of the windows and will help the city come up with a way to solve the problem.The odors mainly were reported from the vinyl replacement acoustic windows manufactured by Sound Solutions, which went out of business in 2014.The screens are located between the inner and storm windows. When windows are closed on hot days, a \"minichamber for those odors\" is created by high temperatures and heat, O'Donnell said.\"It is the screen material, the location of the screen in the window design and then it is when that window is exposed to heat and hot temperatures,\" she said.Chris Everts, an environmental engineer for Wood, said the company conducted both indoor testing and testing of individual parts of the windows, including the sealants and screens.\"We put (the window components) inside a small jar, heated them up and created a worst-case scenario because we were trying to look for as a high a concentration as we could find,\" Everts said.The city recommends that homeowners remove the screens and open the exterior windows to vent the smell, O'Donnell said.So far, 67 homeowners have agreed to the city's offer to replace the windows.Pamela Zidarich lives on South Latrobe Avenue in the Clearing community area just south of Midway and has become an advocate on behalf of others with smelly city-installed windows. She said she has not agreed to sign a replacement agreement and wants to thoroughly inspect the test results.\"I'll reserve any opinion until I see their findings. It's the prudent thing to do,\" Zidarich said. \"I want to see the science.\"The city has allocated $1 million to the window issue, of which $300,000 has been spent on testing, said Aviation Department spokeswoman Lauren Huffman.The findings will be discussed at Thursday night's meeting of the Midway Noise Compatibility Commission on the Southwest Side, O'Donnell said. Separately, Ald.

{"content": "NEW YORK, NY \u2013 MARCH 09: Naji Marshall #13 of the Xavier Musketeers reacts. (Photo by Elsa/Getty Images)Besides Villanova at the top and DePaul at the bottom, each Big East Basketball team has a wide range of variability for the upcoming season.Summer practice sessions are in full swing for all 10 Big East squads, which means it\u2019s a good time to take stock of expectations for 2018-19.Roster turnover is the name of the game heading into this Big East season; 10 of the top 15 and 15 of the top 25 Big East players last year (per PRPG!) have moved onto the pros. The exits of so many stars leaves almost every team in a state of flux that should have a wild effect on the standings throughout the year.In this piece, I break down the best and worst-case scenarios for each team, complete with a range where each team should reasonably finish in the Big East by the end of the season. While some teams have much smaller ranges (it would be surprising to see Villanova fall out of the top two, for example), other programs, such as St. John\u2019s, could be much more volatile.Something to keep in mind: each best and worst-case scenario is still within reason for that given team. Every team\u2019s best-case scenario is to win the Big East, but that obviously is unrealistic. So while DePaul could technically compete for a conference title, based on what we saw last season, and what the Blue Demons added to the roster, there is still a definite ceiling for the team.Now let\u2019s dive in.", "id": "6"}
{"content": "The Buffalo Sabres acquired Jeff Skinner from the Carolina Hurricanes. Here\u2019s why the Sabres won the trade in a landslide.Late on Thursday night, the Buffalo Sabres made an unexpected addition to their roster. Desperately needing a left wing, the Sabres traded for Carolina Hurricanes forward Jeff Skinner. He has one year remaining on his deal, which makes it an even more interesting trade from Buffalo\u2019s perspective.It remains to be seen precisely what they will do with Skinner. Do the Sabres intend on extending the 26-year-old forward? Or are they thinking outside the box, potentially looking to increase his value a bit and then trade him for a larger haul in February? Either option makes sense, though the former is more likely.With few exceptions, nothing good in life is free. The Sabres gave up Cliff Pu (one of their top 10 prospects), a 2019 second-round pick, a 2020 third-round pick, and a 2020 sixth-round pick. Getting Skinner without forfeiting any roster players or any of their three 2019 first-round picks is highway robbery.Pu is a very promising prospect, but will likely max out as a third-line wing. His stats in junior hockey have been solid, but not overwhelming, especially given his age. The Sabres have been rebuilding for long enough, so it\u2019s easy to see why they would be willing to part with a second-round pick, a third-round pick, and a sixth-round pick. Especially when the last two aren\u2019t even until 2020.Now, why would a rebuilding team want to extend Skinner? First of all, he\u2019s quietly been one of the league\u2019s better scorers. Since joining the league in 2012-13, Skinner\u2019s 153 goals rank 17th in the NHL among forwards. Even in a down year, he put up 24 goals. By comparison, the Sabres leading scorer among left wings (Evander Kane) scored 20 despite being traded at the trade deadline.At some point during a rebuild, you have to surround your centers with talented wings. Skinner will be the best wing star center Jack Eichel has ever played with in Buffalo. Likewise, Eichel will be, by a wide margin, the best center Skinner has played with in recent years.Want your voice heard? Join the Puck Prose team!Trade Grade: A+. It\u2019s hard to see this trade ending badly for the Sabres, no matter what their logic is in making the trade.", "id": "7"}
{"content": "With seven or eight different options in the mix at wide receiver for Oklahoma State football, Jelani Woods could be a name to watch in 2018.Oklahoma State football made the interesting move of switching the position of former three-star pro-style quarterback recruit Jelani Woods. At 6-foot-7, Woods definitely has the size to standout at either position talking purely in terms of measurables.However, the quarterback competition is stretched across four different options each at a different year in their college careers. It would\u2019ve been difficult for Woods to find his niche at quarterback for the Pokes since he had to compete with Taylor Cornelius, John Kolar, Keondre Wudtee, and Spencer Sanders.With some more consistent play calling from offensive coordinator Mike Yurcich over the past two seasons, he should know exactly where to place and how to use Woods in the offense. His size, strength, and vision as a former quarterback should allow him to find a place in the receiving corps to offer a ton of value.The position switch for Woods was originally announced near the conclusion of spring camp back in April, according to the Tulsa World. That was pretty good timing since Woods got part of spring practice and all of summer workouts and fall camp to get adjusted to his new position.This also comes at an opportune time since the Pokes see standout receivers depart like James Washington, Marcell Ateman, and Chris Lacy. Woods got to witness what was possibly the best receiving corps in the nation last year and how they prepared for each and every Saturday.Woods will fit in among a host of young wide receivers trying to make their way in the Oklahoma State offense. He is the tallest of the bunch so he could be a good outside receiver that becomes a weapon in the red zone. His height and vision will help out in that part of the field.Oklahoma State also does not have a proven weapon like that currently with the departure of Ateman who used to be the guy that former quarterback Mason Rudolph could just chuck it up to bring down a 50/50 ball. It would take Woods some time to get accustomed to a role like that, but it would be huge for Oklahoma State to find another receiver who can do that.Woods wasn\u2019t the fastest quarterback that Oklahoma State had in the mix before. Yet, Woods does have the right frame for a taller wide receiver or even a tight end. That will continue to make him an intriguing option for Yurcich to look to in the Oklahoma State offense.", "id": "8"}
{"content": "July 30--When Prince Amukamara spoke to Roquan Smith on Sunday, he was able to tell the Bears rookie linebacker that he's been there before and by \"there\" he means looking in from the outside when it comes to training camp.Amukamara had a six-day holdout in 2011 with the Giants. It was the year of the lockout with one of the major provisions in the new collective bargaining unit being a rookie wage scale that was supposed to eliminate (or dramatically reduce) the number of holdouts by first-round picks.The Giants selected the cornerback 19th overall and negotiations became bogged down when the Buccaneers gave defensive end Adrian Clayborn more guaranteed money in the fourth year of his contract as the 20th overall pick than was expected. So the Giants went to training camp and Amukamara remained in Nebraska while the deal got hammered out by his agent Todd France. Amukamara wound up having the longest holdout that season, and Smith is in the same position this year after the Jets reached agreement Monday morning with quarterback Sam Darnold on a contract.\"The thing was Adrian got more guaranteed money than what I was supposed to get,\" Amukamara said. \"So the Giants were like, 'Whoa! We're not going to pay for Tampa Bay's mistake.' You have to understand these contracts are public. My agent was fighting for me and that's what I paid him to do. Both sides wound up being happy.\"Players are going to almost always side with other players when it comes to matters of money and contracts. Amukamara understands Smith's position even as the situation drags on with the linebacker certain to not play Thursday in the preseason opener against the Ravens in Canton, Ohio.At this point, Smith has missed so much time that even if a deal was done quickly, he could miss the second preseason game at Cincinnati on Aug. 9.\"I spoke to Roquan yesterday and he is working his butt off,\" Amukamara said. \"He is training hard. I told him, 'Hey, I was in the same position. You have to trust the process and trust the agent you are with.' I am sure both sides are close and both sides want to get something done. Hopefully, it happens soon.\"From what everyone saw at OTAs, he has a motor. He definitely is a pro. I am not saying he has it figured out but he is definitely disciplined so I am sure he is taking care of business.\"The most important business right now is a deal being brokered for the No. 8 pick in the draft.bmbiggs@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "9"}

{"content": "ATLANTA, GA \u2013 JANUARY 08: Defensive tackle Trenton ThompsonWhen Georgia Football got a commitment from defensive tackle Travon Walker, they got more than just a 5-star player, they changed a narrative.Tuesday was a good day for Georgia Football fans. Travon Walker\u2018s commitment to UGA was a big moment for their 2019 class. His decision helped propel UGA to 5th right now in the 247 composite rankings. Once again, it looks like the Dawgs will be in the running for a top 3 class again this season.Walker\u2019s commitment, however, was about more than just getting a good player. His decision will lead to some ripple effects that will shape this class. To start with, he is the first 5-star defensive tackle that Kirby Smart has received a commitment from since he arrived back in 2016.With August just a few days away, fans across the SEC are starting to get quite excited. Teams like South Carolina and Missouri are already starting to get a little bit too excited about their 2018 seasons. Florida and Tennessee also seem to assume that they will instantly be better under their new head coaches.But here at UGA, things just keep chugging along. Our record-breaking 2018 signing class is in town and seems to be fitting in nicely. The young players that need to step up and fight for positions are working hard. While everyone outside Athens seems to have something to say about this current Georgia team, Kirby Smart and his players are relatively quiet.Instead, they\u2019re just doing the work they need to on the recruiting trail and the practice field.

{"content": "Today is the MLB\u2019s trade deadline and because baseball is the only Big 4 sport in season right now, it\u2019s dominating sports news. The Dallas Stars may be in the midst of the dog days of summer, but that doesn\u2019t mean fans can\u2019t use today\u2019s MLB news to dream about what may happen at the end of next February.The season is still two months away (65 days and counting), but the Dallas Stars still have a few question marks on their opening night roster. That roster and the options around the league will probably change drastically by February, but let\u2019s have some fun and take a look at a few scenarios of how this could play out.Best Case ScenarioThe best case scenario is that the Stars go into the trade deadline like they did in 2015-16, looking to maybe add a few improvements but doing well. That year\u2019s main pick-up didn\u2019t pan out very well, as the Stars had to go for Kris Russell over Dan Hamhuis at the deadline.This year, if the Stars are doing well, they may not need to add much if anything at the deadline. They could get out of the deadline with the team intact and a clear path to the playoffs. They could also use it as a chance for a deadline rental that might sign a contract with the team in the long run.A lot depends on the rest of this off-season and contract negotiations, but there\u2019s a chance the Stars could grab someone like Artemi Panarin or Jeff Skinner as a deadline rental with the potential to work out a contract extension if things go well.Worst Case ScenarioIt\u2019s obviously bad news for the season if the Stars are sellers at the deadline. If things go poorly again next season, the Stars have a few assets that people may be interested in. If Jason Spezza is having a bounceback season while the rest of the team struggles, he could bring some often-desired veteran presence to a team. Marc Methot could help out a defense that\u2019s lacking another solid player.However, there\u2019s one major way that this could all go horribly wrong that is the absolute worst case scenario for the team.If Tyler Seguin decides he\u2019d rather test free agency and move on, he would make an amazing trade deadline rental for some other team, but it would be a devastating blow to the Dallas Stars.It looks like a deal with Seguin may get signed sooner rather than later, but if Jim Nill can\u2019t lock Seguin down, this trade deadline has the potential to be a disaster for the organization. If that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s likely that Nill\u2019s reign as GM, which started with a bang when he brought in Seguin during his first summer, will end with Seguin\u2019s departure.Most Realistic ScenarioThe Dallas Stars can absolutely make the playoffs next year if they keep it together, but it\u2019s very possible that they go into the deadline in the middle of the pack. Nill probably won\u2019t make any major moves one way or another if that\u2019s the case, but there are a few interesting possibilities if he feels the team is only a piece or two away from a deep run at that point.If Ben Bishop is hurt or if he needs some help, there are plenty of goaltenders who are pending UFAs for next summer that could be potential targets. Many of them will probably sign extensions at some point, but if not, Sergei Bobrovsky or Semyon Varlamov could help if something happens with Bishop. If the back-up goalie is the issue, as is so often the case with the Stars, they could target someone else\u2019s, like Cam Ward or Peter Budaj.Panarin or Skinner would be flashy additions, but if Nill is looking for some cheap depth scoring, Thomas Vanek may be an option. Eric Staal\u2018s on a expiring, reasonable contract that\u2019s a great deal for how he\u2019s been playing in Minnesota, but they may not be ready to part ways with him at an affordable price.There\u2019s also still the possibility that Erik Karlsson is in play at that point. That would certainly help out the Stars\u2019 defense, but it would come at a steep price that probably wouldn\u2019t be worth the payoff.There\u2019s seven months for things to change wildly, but adding a smaller piece or two and making the playoffs seems like a very possible scenario for the Stars. If Nill can do that and keep Seguin in Dallas, he\u2019ll buy himself at least another year or two from management.", "id": "13"}

Wilson's older sister was also wounded.The Bay Area Rapid Transit police chief called the unprovoked violence one of the \"most vicious attacks\" he'd seen in his nearly 30-year career.John Lee Cowell, a 27-year-old homeless man with a long criminal history, has been charged with murder and attempted murder. His family issued a statement saying that Cowell had been found to have bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, and that \"the system\" had failed to provide him with adequate treatment.What Wilson's family and many other African-Americans see, though, is a hate crime -- plain and simple. Authorities said they are still investigating Cowell's background and aren't ready to make that call.A vigil for the teenager turned into a protest that drew hundreds of people into the streets of Oakland. She has become the latest face of the #sayhername movement that recognizes black women who are victims of racial violence by police and others.At another point in America's history, the racial component of this killing might not have been enough to thrust it to the forefront of our country's contentious struggle with race. But in this modern era of heightened tensions, race quickly becomes the central element of nearly every conflict between blacks and whites.This is the divisive nation we have created for ourselves. Whether we choose to acknowledge it or not, race boils beneath the surface of every major disagreement we have.It is one thing for African-Americans to try to explain the imbalance of power that too often puts blacks at the receiving end of a police officer's gun or, in Wilson's case, a stranger's knife.When African-Americans talk about race, many white people tend to write it off as race baiting, passing the buck or playing the race card.It is impossible to get some white people to even listen when blacks talk about the fear of a loved one being stopped for a simple traffic violation. African-Americans have never been able to convince enough white people that black lives matter.So why do African-Americans keep trying to drill this point? It's not simply because blacks want all white people to like them. It's because regardless of the changing racial and ethnic demographics in America, white people always will have the balance of power weighted on their side -- as it always has been.That's the white privilege Hathaway was talking about on her Instagram.\"The murder of Nia Wilson -- may she rest in the power and peace she was denied here -- is unspeakable AND MUST NOT be met with silence. She is not a hash tag; she was a black woman and she was murdered in cold blood by a white man,\" Hathaway wrote underneath a photo of Wilson. \"White people -- including me, including you -- must take into the marrow of our privileged bones the truth that ALL black people fear for their lives DAILY in America and have done so for GENERATIONS. White people DO NOT have equivalence for this fear of violence.\"Given those givens, we must ask our (white) selves- how 'decent' are we really? Not in our intent, but in our actions? In our lack of action? Peace and prayers and JUSTICE for Nia and the Wilson family.\"She ended the post with the hashtags #blacklivesmatter #antiracist #noexcuse #sayhername #earntherighttosayhername.Of course, Hathaway isn't the only celebrity to speak out about Wilson's death. Several African-Americans, including Viola Davis, Common, Janelle Monae and Jada Pinkett Smith, have expressed their sentiments on social media.But too often, black celebrities end up preaching to other black people.Nothing is more powerful than a privileged white person talking to white people about white privilege.Though Hathaway might not have had any luck getting those who adamantly deny that white privilege exists to change their minds, she got further than any African-American could.She got white people talking about white privilege with other white people. And in the process, they were forced to say Nia Wilson's name.dglanton@chicagotribune.comMORE FROM DAHLEEN GLANTON___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "14"}

Here is why the returning Stanford running back will win the trophy in 2018.In 2017, Bryce Love finally got his opportunity to take over feature duties at running back for Stanford. After emerging from Christian McCaffrey\u2019s shadow, Love blew up as the most dominant Power Five back in the country. While Saquon Barkley got more hype, Love blew his rushing numbers out of the water.Love\u2019s 19 rushing touchdowns ranked fifth nationally. The Stanford back finished with over 2,100 rushing yards, ranking behind only San Diego State\u2019s Rashaad Penny in ground production. While he wasn\u2019t as dynamic in the passing game, Love was the catalyst that drove Stanford to the Pac-12 North title.The most impressive part, though, is that Love continued to put up big numbers even as he suffered through nagging injuries. If he can stay healthy in 2018, Stanford may finally break through for its first Heisman Trophy since Jim Plunkett snatched the award in 1970.After coping with the oh-so-close pain of seeing a slew of runner-up performances since Plunkett\u2019s victory, Stanford is ready to break their streak of Heisman misses. With the Cardinal looking to contend in the Pac-12 race once again, Love will remain on the minds of Heisman voters all the way to the dais of the Downtown Athletic Club in December.", "id": "15"}
{"content": "Fans were shocked to learn Andrew Lincoln would be walking away during season 9 of AMC\u2019s mega-hit, The Walking Dead.Rumors began circulating last spring that The Walking Dead star, Andrew Lincoln, would be exiting the series during season nine. The series star, only one of three actors left from season 1\u2019s core cast, spoke about his plans and how he came to finally walk away from the show.Spoilers ahead!While The Walking Dead has always juggled staying faithful to the comics versus going in a different direction creatively, Rick Grimes (Lincoln) and his son, Carl (Chandler Riggs) always seemed \u201csafe.\u201dCharacters can come and go, but without Rick Grimes leading the group, it seemed there would be no show. After The Walking Dead killed off Riggs\u2019 Carl, Lincoln\u2019s character was once again placed center stage against foe, Negan.Last weekend, at San Diego Comic-Con, Lincoln revealed to Digital Spy that he\u2019d been mulling over his exit as far back as season four. Lincoln approached then-executive producer, Scott Gimple, about his exit storyline.While speaking to Digital Spy, Lincoln reflected that his conversation with Gimple entailed somehow concluding a story that doesn\u2019t have a conclusion in sight. Lincoln explained to Digital Spy:\u201cIt was a lot to do with a conversation that Scott and I had a few years ago, maybe in season four, about a shape, and finding some way to complete something that was never going to be completed.\u201dLincoln\u2019s exit brings up many questions for Walking Dead fans: what does this mean for Rick? What does this mean for Michonne? What does this mean for Judith? How will The Walking Dead conclude the Rick and Negan feud? The season nine trailer revealed at San Diego Comic-Con shows a time jump and tension between Rick and Negan.For the first time in Walking Dead history, the show has begun writing characters off the canvass without killing them off: Morgan (Lennie James) walked out into the wilderness, while the actor crossed over to the prequel, Fear the Walking Dead. Will this same strategy be employed when Rick Grimes leaves?At the Walking Dead panel at SDCC, Lincoln shared he plans to take some time off from acting before returning to work again; he currently has no new projects in the works. Season 9 of The Walking Dead debuts on Oct. 7 on AMC. Seasons 1-7 can be streamed on Netflix and season 8 will be added in September.", "id": "16"}
{"content": "Aug. 01--The calendar says it's the first of August. But an unforgiving early wave of heat means that California's landscape feels as dry as September, igniting a deadly wildfire season up and down the state.Hot and dry as a powder keg, recent weather has accelerated the normal drying of western landscapes, turning vegetation into kindling, say weather experts. Even nights are warm.\"Fuels are really really dry. It's closer to what we should get by late summer or early fall,\" said professor Craig Clements, director of the Fire Weather Research Lab at San Jose State University.The \"fuel moisture level\" of shrubs, trees and grasses -- the single largest factor for how primed an area is to burn -- is below average throughout the state, including the Bay Area, data shows.Normally, the mean fuel moisture content of vegetation in Mendocino County, where the Mendocino Complex fires are raging, is 12.4 percent; now it's less than 11 percent. In Shasta County, the site of the huge Carr Fire, moisture content has fallen from an average of 9.4 percent to 7 percent, according to a web-based climate tool, developed with Google by John Abatzoglou, associate professor of geography at the University of Idaho. The \"Climate Engine\" tool assesses how wet or dry a landscape's vegetation is -- and how likely it is to ignite and carry a fire.The Bay Area's vegetation also is dry, it shows. In Santa Clara County, moisture content at this time of year normally is 10.59 percent -- now it's 9.3 percent; in Alameda County, normally 11.5 percent, it's fallen to 10.6 percent; in Contra Costa County, normally 11.45 percent, it's nine percent; and San Mateo County has fallen from an average of 14.5 percent to 13.8 percent.But that's just part of the story: Nights have been warm, as well, with everywhere from Eureka to Death Valley above normal. At San Jose Airport, July's average low temperature is 58 degrees; last month it was 61.\"When it's a couple degrees warmer overnight, you already have a head start on the next day,\" said Steve Anderson, meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Monterey.The Golden State always has been a thirsty land -- even before you factor in the hazards of a worsening climate. With a Mediterranean climate, nearly all of our rain falls from November to April. And last winter's precipitation was below normal. By August, we've gone four months without receiving a drop of rain.But a persistent high pressure system makes it feel like a training ground for Hades, unless you live in foggy San Francisco.Nowhere has this month's heat been more brutal than in Death Valley, where July's average high reached 121 degrees -- four degrees above the annual average.All over the state, the departure from average temperatures ranges from two to eight degrees. Down in Riverside County, alfalfa grower Grant Chaffin reported that crops are being hit with \"summer slump,\" with high nighttime temperatures causing yields to drop by half, according to the California Farm Bureau.Only San Francisco and parts of Marin County are celebrating summer-as-usual.Research by a team lead by Abatzoglou shows that these hot conditions, which dehydrate our vegetation, are contributing to fire risk.In recent years, human-caused increases in temperature have dried out western U.S. forests, accounting for about half of the increase in tinder-dry conditions, he found. The other half of problem is driven by natural temperature variations.Climate change is projected to increase to potential for fires across this western landscape, according to his research. It estimates that human-caused climate change contributed to an additional 10.5 million acres of high-risk forest fire areas between 1984 -- 2015.\"The effect is one of warming -- and also decreases in humidity,\" he said.Additionally, there is growing recognition that warming temperatures can worsen a drought.A Stanford team previously reported that the conditions behind our 2011-2017 drought -- a high pressure system parked over the Pacific Ocean, diverting storms away from California -- are much more likely to occur amid concentrations of greenhouse gases.Scientists warn that there could be be even worse heat waves, droughts and fire risks in the future -- as the planet endures increasingly volatile weather patterns that will make dry places, like much of California, dangerously drier.___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "17"}

(Photo by Christian Petersen/Getty Images) *** Local Caption *** Ed ReedWith the Pro Football Hall of Fame ceremonies winding down, it is never too early to look to next year. Who are the big first-year nominees in 2019?The Pro Football Hall of Fame 48-member selection committee has spoken. The 2018 Hall of Fame class includes Ray Lewis, Randy Moss, Brian Urlacher, Terrell Owens and Brian Dawkins. Of the five members selected Lewis, Moss and Urlacher are first ballot Hall of Famers. While it is not unusual to have first ballot Hall of Famers, having three in one year is a testament to these players\u2019 ability.Could there be three more first ballot hall of famers next year? Highlighting next year\u2019s first year-nominees are safety Ed Reed, tight end Tony Gonzalez and cornerback Champ Bailey. All three players are certainly hall of fame worthy. But they face stiff competition from returning nominees Tony Boselli, Isaac Bruce and Edgerrin James. Also, don\u2019t underestimate a dark horse candidate like John Lynch who could make election difficult for Reed.Let\u2019s take a way too early look at next year\u2019s big first-year nominees.Ed Reed, SafetyBefore getting to statistics, the most impressive aspect of Ed Reed\u2019s game was his ability to line up all over the field to hide coverages. During Reed\u2019s tenure, the Baltimore Ravens could line up Reed as a linebacker in a 46 front only to send him over 50 yards across the field for a cover-2 defensive shell. The fact that Reed could pull that off effectively makes him a sure fire hall of fame safety. His ability to line up all over to hide coverages made the Ravens defense completely unreadable pre-snap. He is a major reason that Ravens defense was historically good.The statistics also bear this out. Reed is the owner of the two longest interception returns in NFL history (106 and 107 yards). He also has the most career yardage off interceptions with 1,590. He has seven career pick-sixes.Ed Reed created the mold of free safety that NFL teams are now looking to duplicate. There was only one Ed Reed and he is a first ballot Hall of Famer. But how do Gonzalez and Bailey stack up?", "id": "18"}

If its share prices continued to climb at the same percentage as they did in 2017, it was inevitable the company would end up at the top spot. The company\u2019s valuation of $869 billion at the time (which is created by taking the share price of each company and multiplying it by the number of shares available), put it $140 billion ahead of Google parent company Alphabet, and $200 billion ahead of Microsoft.While the Cupertino, California, giant is the first to reach $1 trillion, it likely won\u2019t be the last. Amazon is trailing closely behind following its third-quarter earnings. The company revealed that in July, it exceeded $900 billion in market value.As for Apple, the company said during its earnings call that it expected revenue next quarter to be between $60 billion and $62 billion. To reach that estimate \u2014 which is ahead of Wall Street expectations that come in at $58.47 billion \u2014 Apple would need to see a 15 percent increase over the same quarter last year.A majority of the company\u2019s growth could be credited to its \u201cservices\u201d category \u2014 such as Apple Music, Apple Pay, iTunes, iCloud, and more. Apple saw $9.55 billion in revenue for the category, bringing it up 28 percent from the same quarter last year.

{"content": "The New York Giants went into the off season with a glut of issues. So,in honor of Mission Impossible, which has been on all weekend, I want to take a minute and rewind on the impossible task that Jerry Reese refused to correct.First year in, Dave Gettleman and Pat Shurmur have changed the way the New York Giants have been operating, the defense is fired up and aggressive under the new coordinator but the best tidbit to come out to start is that the Giants offensive line is playing with an edge like they never had before.This is not the same line that Jerry Reese neglected for the most part and when pushed against a wall and told to fix it, he looked everyone in the face and said these guys will all be better next year.That\u2019s like busting all day on a Black Jack table then betting all your remaining money on the hope things might get better. Instead Gettleman went out and got bigger up front on offense and defense.We don\u2019t yet know if the line is great yet, but in fairness it definitely couldn\u2019t have gotten worse. With the additions of a new left tackle in Nate Solder and left guard in Will Hernandez, the whole left side of the Giants line became technically sound and a little tougher.Many people may have also forgotten that Ereck Flowers (who played left tackle the last few years) was originally supposed to learn on the right side and let Will Beatty handle blindside duties.This may be a bold prediction but I feel that Flowers will have a great year on the right side being a mauler style player as well as having Saquon Barkley, Jonathan Stewart and Wayne Gallman Jr. aiding in chipping on the front side should lead to some great pancake moments for him this coming year.Next Saquon Barkley being drafted brought down the house, once again there is no saying this was a homerun. However Gettleman seen enough of the Giants running game or lack thereof to not make a change.Gettleman ignored the chatter of drafting a quarterback and brought in a difference maker, then added a familiar face to mentor in past star Stewart and has another bruising back in second year man Gallman who ran halfway decent last year.With three stable backs Eli Manning should feel some of the pressure disappear from him and also save his arm down the stretch if the Giants can pull an amazing turnaround from last year.The final mission has yet to be completed, but this falls on coach Shurmur, he has to be ready coming out of camp. If this means jumping out of a window onto the roof of another skyscraping building then so be it. (Wait sorry watched to many movies this past weekend.)What it really means is if Coach Shurmur has to rely on some rookies to lead the way then he should. If he can stay away from the previous coaches\u2019 mistakes of not playing the best player available and live with some of the rookie mistakes they make their way through the growing pains he will have won the locker room and will set himself and the team up for great future success.The Giants fan base may have been on Ghost Protocol last year, but with a new season upon us there is great hope good things are on the horizon.", "id": "21"}

It was just the third time in franchise history that the A's have swept a season series of seven games or longer.The A's won all four games in Toronto from May 17 -- May 20 before completing the sweep in Oakland this week by a 24-6 margin. The sweep was particularly satisfying in the wake of the A's three-game losing streak in Colorado last weekend.\"I don't want to say it was important, but when you're playing as well as we were playing and you get three in a row handed to you, it humbles you a little bit,\" A's manager Bob Melvin said. \"To get home here and win three games... works really well.\"The win pushed the A's into a tie with the Seattle Mariners for the second wild-card spot in the American League. The A's trailed the Mariners by 11 games on June 16, the day they picked up the first of 30 wins in 40 games.\"It doesn't mean anything to me,\" catcher Jonathan Lucroy said. \"Somebody (told) me earlier I need to be happy and I said, I'll be happy when I'm sitting on the podium with a World Series trophy next to me.\"I don't care that we're tied because we still have a lot of work left to do.\"Melvin said Lucroy begged him for the opportunity to play in a day game after a night game. In his eight years in the big leagues, Lucroy's only played on one playoff team for a full season, fueling his desire to play as much as possible.\"Not really begging, more demanding, \" Lucroy joked as he recounted his conversation with Melvin prior to Wednesday's game. \"I told him, look, we have a chance to win. I want to be in there.\"He delivered by providing all the offense the A's needed against starter Marcus Stroman (4-8) Wednesday, recording his second four-RBI game in 10 days.Lucroy got the A's on the board in the second, bringing in Khris Davis and Matt Olson with a two-out line drive to the opposite field.He threw another ribeye on the grill in the fourth, scoring Marcus Semien from first with a double into the left field corner. Then, the A's catcher produced his 15th RBI in 12 games with a single to left in the sixth, driving in Mark Canha.Lucroy wasn't the only hitter at the bottom of the order who mashed the ball Wednesday afternoon. The eighth, ninth batters brought in seven of the A's eight runs as ninth hitter Franklin Barreto scored Semien and Lucroy with a double in the sixth before homering to left in the eighth.Leadoff man Nick Martini drove in the A's fourth run in the fourth with a sacrifice fly to center. With three hits, Barreto came a triple short of hitting for the cycle.\"I'm a firm believer that when you have a real deep lineup sooner or later someone in the lineup's going to get you,\" Lucroy said. \"It might not be the first five guys, it might not be the last four guys. It can be anyone.\"As Lucroy and the Barreto swatted the ball around the diamond, Sean Manaea silenced the Blue Jays bats from the mound. Manaea (10-7), who's been a rock of stability in a rotation that's featured 12 different pitchers this season, surrendered one earned run over six innings, extending his winning streak in day baseball to 12 games.The Blue Jays failed to advance a runner past second base while Manaea was on the mound, scoring his earned run when Randall Grichuk doubled off J.B. Wendelken, bringing in a runner that the reliever inherited from the tall lefty.\"You need an ace,\" Melvin said. \"I don't know where we'd be without him.

Next up is Tony La Russa with 798 wins and then Connie Mack with 3,582 wins.-- The A's are optimistic that Matt Joyce will start swinging the bat soon after he received a second epidural for his back this week. Joyce has been on the disabled list since July 5 with a lower-back strain.-- Melvin expects Chad Pinder to start swinging the bat \"any day.\" Pinder, who received stitches last week to repair a left-elbow laceration suffered in a car accident, has been taking ground balls since he went on the disabled list on July 28.-- Andrew Triggs played catch for the second time Wednesday morning. The right-hander has been on the disabled list since May 18 because of nerve irritation in his throwing arm.-- The A's optioned outfield Dustin Fowler to Triple-A Nashville and reinstated outfield Boog Powell from the 60-day disabled list. Powell, who had been sidelined with a sprained right knee since April 7, was also optioned to Nashville.-- Right-hander Daniel Gossett underwent successful Tommy John surgery Wednesday.-- Matt Chapman reached base in his 18th consecutive game, recording a single in the first.___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "22"}
{"content": "HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) \u2014 A high school student has designed an online resource to help immigrant children and teenagers learn how to prepare for the possible deportations of parents or guardians.  Sixteen-year-old Jody Bell, who will be a senior this fall at Greenwich High School, said she came up with the idea after hearing firsthand the concerns of some close friends who were afraid to speak with guidance counselors or adults about their fears surrounding deportation. Many, she said, have family members who are at risk of being deported, as President Donald Trump's administration has taken a harder line on immigration.  \"They would talk to close friends, like me and some others,\" Bell said. \"And that, I think, was one of the first times that I recognized that this was an issue.\"                              Bell, who turns 17 next month, said she knew she wanted to \"take action\" on the immigration issue but was unsure what to do. That was around the time a guidance counselor told her about a new Connecticut-based organization called Girls With Impact , a program billed as a \"12-week mini-MBA\" in which teenage girls create businesses, nonprofits or projects that will affect the world and their success in life.  Bell was among the first group of graduates, finishing the program in the spring of 2017. She launched her website, In Case of Deportation, this month.  The online program is geared toward children ages 8 to 18 and is written in a way young people can understand, Bell said. It explains what deportation is, how to talk to family members about it, what a child's options are if a parent or guardian is deported and what should be considered when making a deportation preparedness plan for a child.    Bell writes, \"In some situations, your parent/guardian may be detained and arrested awaiting deportation without even saying goodbye or having just a few minutes to prepare you. Before this abrupt detainment happens, it's important that you and your family are prepared in case of emergency deportation.\"  Bell suggests practical steps like making sure children have keys to their houses and copies of their medical records and know how to find legal help and financial assistance. She came up with information through months of her own research and discussions with experts, including advocacy groups, immigration lawyers and state officials.  The teen's platform, which she plans to continue evolving and updating, is already being used by several school districts, including Greenwich and New Rochelle Schools of New York, said Girls With Impact CEO Jennifer Openshaw, a tech entrepreneur and financial expert who started the nonprofit program.  Openshaw said girls like Bell, who have participated in the program, have a \"huge leg up\" in college because they've created a real business plan and launched something tangible, like Bell's online program. Operating for about a year, Girls With Impact works with about 15 girls per class, who live all across the country. The organization has plans to run 10,000 girls through the year-round program by 2022. A new class begins in the fall.", "id": "23"}
{"content": "July 30--A year ago, Norma Sanchez and Ambrocio Carrera were on the verge of losing their East Oakland home -- staring down a massive rent hike and with no hope of affording a new place close to their jobs or their three sons' schools.Now, thanks to an innovative strategy gaining traction in the Bay Area, not only did the family stay put, they're on their way to owning that home.\"It's very emotional,\" Carrera said in Spanish. \"It's something that, in the beginning, you don't believe. But here we are.\"Sanchez and Carrera held onto their home with the help of a community land trust -- an organization that buys up residential properties, keeps ownership of the ground beneath the buildings and then rents or sells the units back to low-income residents at a discount. It's an unusual strategy that does two things traditional government-subsidized affordable housing does not -- it guarantees the property will remain affordable forever, and it gives residents the chance to build equity in their home.As soaring prices continue to squeeze Bay Area renters, leaving both cities and affordable-housing advocates desperate for solutions, community land trusts are becoming an increasingly attractive option. There are at least seven operating in the Bay Area, including in Oakland, San Francisco, East Palo Alto and Sonoma County. And though the average resident likely hasn't heard of the wonky concept, the trusts have secured affordable housing for dozens of families.\"There is really a resurgent interest in this model, because we see that so many other approaches are not really measurably moving the needle in terms of the crisis,\" said Steve King, executive director of the Oakland Community Land Trust, which bought Carrera's and Sanchez's house.Separating the house from the land under it is a key piece of the land trust strategy because it acts as a safeguard to ensure the property can never again be sold at market rate. Instead, if the owners decide to sell, they go through the land trust, which sets a price that keeps the unit affordable for the next low-income family.\"It's sort of this rearrangement or this reconfiguration of what property ownership really means,\" King said.The Oakland Community Land Trust received $974,150 from the city earlier this year and also pulls in funding from foundations, banks and other sources. Since 2010, the trust has purchased 20 single-family homes, two mixed-use buildings and one seven-unit live-work building.\"The city thinks very highly of community land trusts,\" said Darin Ranelletti, Oakland's policy director for housing security -- a role Mayor Libby Schaaf created this year to address the housing shortage. \"We think that they're a great model.\"On the other side of the Bay, the San Francisco Community Land Trust controls 13 properties, including one across the street from the Transamerica Pyramid. Residents of that 21-unit apartment building each pay a $10,000 deposit, plus monthly mortgage payments, to own a stake in their building.\"It's one of the very few tools we have to provide a way to home ownership for the very low-income folks of San Francisco,\" said Tyler Macmillan, the land trust's organizational director.The Housing Land Trust of Sonoma County, which houses nearly 80 families, is an official part of the local government's affordable-housing strategy. When new low-income units are built, cities hand them over to the land trust, which then sells them to low-income residents at an affordable price.Land trust fever has spread to East Palo Alto as well, where former Mayor Duane Bay is launching the Pahali Community Land Trust. He's working on buying three properties -- two single-family homes and a vacant lot where he hopes to build townhouses.For 41-year-old Sanchez, who works cleaning homes in San Jose, and 45-year-old Carrera, who works at a Togo's in Pleasanton, the Oakland land trust saved their two-bedroom home. Last August their landlord, Steve Kalmbach, notified them he intended to double their rent -- raising it from $1,200 to $2,400. Under California's Costa Hawkins law -- which voters will decide whether to repeal in November -- single-family homes are exempt from rent control.Sanchez and Carrera fought back with protests and petitions, and the rent hike was put on hold. But then the landlord began making plans to sell the property, leading them to fear they would be kicked out by the new owner. They began trying to convince Kalmbach to sell to the Oakland Community Land Trust. After a year of contentious negotiations -- which included the family picketing Kalmbach's Piedmont home on Halloween, and Sanchez and Carrera's 15-year-old son, Jonatan, putting his fist through the \"For Sale\" sign in the front yard in a moment of despair -- Kalmbach agreed to sell for $335,000. He could not be reached for comment.Now the family pays $1,800 a month in rent to the land trust, and in a few years they'll have the option to funnel some of that money toward a down payment. They pay $50 a month to lease the land under the home from the land trust.When 28-year-old Javier Prescott first heard about land trusts, he was reluctantly considering moving to Oregon with his fiance to start a family because they couldn't afford to buy a home in the Bay Area. A Sonoma County native, Prescott works as lead custodian for the county's Office of Education, and his fiance is a bartender studying to be a nurse.This year, they did something they never thought they'd be able to do -- they bought a house in Petaluma for $323,000 with the help of the Housing Land Trust of Sonoma County. They pay $2,197 for the mortgage -- about 25 percent of their combined incomes -- plus $90 a month to lease the ground under the house.\"Oh my God, you don't even understand how amazing it feels to be a homeowner in Sonoma County,\" Prescott said. \"The housing market is just so overwhelming, that someone my age -- it's not even a thought.\"If they sell the house, the price will be tied to the area's median income gains, not the housing market's fluctuations. So if the median income in Sonoma County rose 10 percent, for example, they could sell the house for 10 percent more than what they paid.Prescott doesn't mind not making a windfall.\"Since I was kind of gifted with this awesome situation, I don't really have any kind of issue paying it forward,\" he said.The community land trust model also can prevent small businesses from being displaced.When the owner of a mixed-use building on 23rd Avenue in East Oakland decided to sell, the tenants raised $90,000 during an eight-week crowd-funding campaign -- enough for a down payment. The Oakland land trust put that money toward buying the building in April and now is training the residents to manage the property themselves, as a collective, with the idea that their rent payments will become mortgage payments in about 10 years.Now the residents -- which include families and individuals, as well as nonprofits renting office space -- are figuring out how to do everything from fix sinks to conduct safety audits of fire extinguishers. The former was a skill they needed almost as soon as they signed the contract, said Devi Peacock, founder of Peacock Rebellion -- a queer and trans arts and culture group that rents space in the building.\"It was so emotional, because we're like, 'Oh my God we signed,' and then almost right away a sink broke,\" Peacock said. \"We cheered. Because you know what? It was like our problem now. And what a thrilling feeling.\"___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "24"}

These 10 amazing peace of mind quotes to live a harmonious life will help you find a quiet place within the storm:1. \u201cPeace comes from within. Do not seek it without.\u201d \u2014 BuddhaBuddha (Sanskrit for \u201cawakened one\u201d) was the founder of Buddhism. Buddhism is not a religion, but the spiritual practice of attaining enlightenment. In the Western world, Buddha is sometimes mistaken for a god, but he was actually a mortal.2. \u201cPeace of mind comes when your life is in harmony with true principles and values and in no other way.\u201d \u2014 Stephen CoveyStephen Covey was a renowned motivational speaker and author whose defining book, \u201cThe 7 Habits of Highly Successful People,\u201d provided personal and professional time-management training.

{"content": "THE (TOO) BIG APPLE. Apple dodged a major financial bullet Tuesday night, and the reason may have something to do with the hyperloop, the futuristic mode of high-speed transportation first proposed by Tesla CEO Elon Musk.Apple calls the city of Cupertino, CA home and, as the company has grown, so has its strain on the city. To address one of its major Apple-caused problems \u2014 transportation \u2014 the city proposed creating a \u201chead tax\u201d \u2013 a tax that would charge any Cupertino-based company with 100 or more employee a flat fee per employee.If it had passed, Apple would have seen its tax bill jump from $17,000 to $9.4 million, according to a report from the Cupertino City Council \u2013 money Cupertino would have used to fund new transportation projects.But the Council voted down the tax on Tuesday, and it could be because they think a Cupertino hyperloop might be a better solution to their transportation woes.TESTING THE WATERS. According to a report by the Silicon Valley Business Journal, Cupertino Mayor Darcy Paul has met with Hyperloop Transportation Technologies (HTT) about the possibility of building one of the high-tech systems in Cupertino. He also thinks Apple might be willing to \u201cheavily subsidize\u201d its construction.Apple, however, has yet to comment directly on a hyperloop project, though the company\u2019s director of state and local government affairs, Michael Foulkes, did suggest during Tuesday\u2019s meeting that Cupertino officials work with Apple on \u201cforward-thinking solutions\u201d to \u201creally be creative and find solutions for the long-term.\u201dIT TAKES A VILLAGE. So far, all plans for a hyperloop in the U.S. are just that: plans. There still isn\u2019t anywhere in the nation a person can actually hop aboard a hyperloop. Part of the hold up, according to HTT CEO Dirk Ahlborn, is getting everyone to sign off on the project.\u201cDemocracy isn\u2019t friendly to these kinds of things. It\u2019s a very large infrastructure project requiring a lot of people to work together,\u201d he told Business Insider in July. \u201cIf you want to do this in the U.S., you have tedious right-of-way issues. In China or Russia, however, all it takes is someone powerful to decide that they want it, and it happens.\u201dA WIN-WIN SITUATION. In Cupertino, getting everyone to work together might not be so hard. The city wants a solution to its transportation issues, and Apple has made it clear it doesn\u2019t want to pay the proposed head tax. Presumably, Apple would have to pay that tax every year. If it agrees to subsidize a Cupertino hyperloop like Paul thinks it might, the company may have an opportunity to trade that recurring fee for a one-time construction cost.While no one can seem to agree on exactly what that cost might be, Apple is now worth a whopping $1 trillion. So if any U.S. company can afford to take a risk on building a hyperloop, it\u2019s probably Apple. And with the city\u2019s government already warmed up to the idea, it might not be long before Apple employees get to enjoy the novelty of riding the Cupertino hyperloop to work every day.", "id": "27"}
{"content": "Aug. 02--When summer's heat and humidity come on, heavy clothes come off. As we remove the layers that kept us warm in winter -- and hid our extra pounds -- many of us don't like what we see, and we resolve to lose weight. Losing weight can make us healthier and improve the quality of our lives. It can also have an impact on our most intimate relationships.Even in small amounts, weight loss affects self-esteem, activity levels and lifestyle -- all of which can either improve or stress a marriage and other intimate bonds.According to a study published in the March issue of JAMA Surgery, weight loss \"surgery was associated with increased incidence of divorce and separation as well as increased incidence of marriage and new relationships.\" Experts think these effects accompany weight loss resulting from diet and lifestyle changes as well as surgery.The JAMA study concludes that weight loss can have both physical and emotional benefits. Those who lose weight became more comfortable socially and feel empowered to seek out a romantic partner -- or gain the confidence to end a relationship that has become toxic.Better choicesMelinda Watman remembers being teased about her weight in kindergarten. \"It took about 30 seconds for the mean kids to turn Katzman (her maiden name) into Fatzman,\" she says. It was then that she made herself \"bulletproof.\" She decided she would excel socially and do well in life. She earned several advanced degrees, including an MBA, and succeeded in a number of careers. She has also had lots of friends.But her love life was less successful. For seven years she engaged in an unhealthy relationship. \"I just shut my eyes to\" his neglect and controlling behaviors, she says.By 2000, standing just over 5 feet, she weighed 225 pounds and decided to try bariatric surgery. She eventually lost 125 pounds and has maintained her weight for more than 18 years. The weight loss, she says, not only made her healthier and happier, it also helped her choose better partners.A year after her surgery, Watman ended the unhealthy relationship. \"I think that he had less control over me, and I had no interest in being controlled\" anymore, she says.Watman, who lives in Boston, is now in a happy 13-year marriage to a man she says is loving and supportive. And, at age 63, she is the president and founder of THE F WORD FAT, an organization that works to prevent weight discrimination and provides weight management support for individuals.Sofia Rydin-Gray, a clinical psychologist and director of behavioral health at the Duke Diet and Fitness Center in Durham, N.C., says losing weight can improve self-esteem and how we relate to others. Feeling better about one's self \"changes the dynamic\" in a relationship and can help individuals assert their own needs more effectively.Wallflower to social butterflyLosing weight can also make people more outgoing, creating opportunities to meet romantic partners. After languishing as a \"wallflower\" most of his life, Rob Portinga, 50, of Tumwater, Wash., found that losing weight got him back into dating.\"I wasn't this way 10 years ago,\" says Portinga, who lost almost 200 pounds after undergoing bariatric surgery in 2008. \"I was the person hiding in the corner at a party, afraid of the rejection I felt was inevitable.\"Portinga's improved health also enabled him to become more active. He took up hiking and leads a group that explores the Central Cascade Mountains. He met his girlfriend, Bonnie Mills, 42, in the group. Every weekend the friends hike together, enjoying camaraderie, beautiful scenery and staying fit.Physical intimacyExcess weight can interfere with a couple's sex life, says Dr. Scott Kahan, director of the National Center for Weight and Wellness in Washington, D.C. \"There may be big differences in the sexual interest and sexual function, as well as attraction between two people in a relationship,\" he says.Physical intimacy often improves after weight loss. Increased self-confidence, better mobility and more energy make sex more enjoyable.Pandora Williams, 41, a personal trainer and general manager of a gym in Wilmington, N.C., says her interest in sex increased after she lost 260 pounds. But her husband continued to show indifference, she said. When she was heavy, she blamed his lack of interest on her weight. When this didn't change, Williams concluded, \"We spoke love in different languages.\"The couple continued to drift apart, separated in 2013 and is now in the process of dissolving their 11-year marriage.Ensuring successLosing weight and keeping it off require better food choices, more meal planning and increased exercise. According to experts, couples can help each other adopt this new lifestyle by thinking of themselves as a team and working together to get healthier. \"The more encouragement and support (partners) get\" from each other, the more likely they are to succeed, Rydin-Gray says.\"At a minimum, you want to have open communication,\" advises Dr. Luke Funk, assistant professor of surgery at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Before beginning a weight-loss program or having surgery, couples should discuss why the overweight partner wants to lose weight, what lifestyle changes will be needed and how they both will benefit from new habits.\"You go through a lot of changes as you lose weight,\" says Funk, \"and it's really critical to have somebody by your side.\"Improved health and greater mobility give couples an opportunity to find new ways to connect. Discovering healthy activities together, such as dancing, hiking or traveling, breathes new life into long-term relationships and can strengthen a couple's bond.More benefits than risksWhile relationships may be negatively affected by weight loss, experts say the benefits outweigh the risks. Improved health, better self-esteem and greater quality of life remove the limitations of excess weight, making individuals happier and more fulfilled. \"When people lose weight,\" says Kahan, \"most things improve.\"And most relationships fare well. Though the JAMA study showed an increase in separations and divorces, Per-Arne Svensson, the study's lead researcher, points out that \"80 percent of those that were married ... were still in the same relationship\" 20 years later.Claire Altschuler is a freelance writer.___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "28"}
{"content": "A recent build of Google\u2019s Gmail app for Android reveals that the service will eventually support email scheduling. The evidence appears within the app\u2019s code, which assigns the \u201cmenu_schedule_send\u201d command to a \u201cSchedule send\u201d menu entry. An excerpt from an XML file also refers to this specific string of code.The purpose of this upcoming feature should be obvious: Native support for scheduling a time for Gmail to automatically send an email. Currently there are \u201cunofficial\u201d ways to schedule an email in Gmail, such as adding the Boomerang browser extension, using a Google Sheets script, installing another browser extension specifically for Google\u2019s Chrome browser, and so on.Although scheduling email sounds like a task abused by spammers, there are legitimate reasons for delayed messages. For instance, you may want an email sent during a period when it will most likely be read, such as during the morning business hours, or during a peak reading time in another time zone. Maybe you need email sent within a specific amount of time after it\u2019s completed.The work of PR firms is a good example. A company may have product information under a scheduled non-disclosure agreement release window that\u2019s already prepared but can\u2019t be delivered to the press until a specific time. A scheduled email means the PR firm can have the information locked and loaded for delivery and move on to the next client.Microsoft\u2019s Outlook client already provides message scheduling. While composing a message, simply select the More Options arrow from the Tags group located on the ribbon. Next, in the Delivery Options window, check the \u201cDo not deliver before\u201d option and then select a date and time. Unfortunately, this feature currently isn\u2019t provided in the online client.Google overhauled Gmail\u2019s interface earlier this year, bringing it closer to the company\u2019s other services. Although the new look provides cleaner access to your emails, Google beefed up the service\u2019s back end including the use of artificial intelligence to generate smart responses, \u201cnudges\u201d that nag you to follow up or respond to messages, and more.\u201cAs a part of the redesign, we\u2019re also tightly integrating Gmail with other G Suite apps you use every day,\u201d the company said in April. \u201cNow you can quickly reference, create, or edit Calendar invites, capture ideas in Keep or manage to-dos in Tasks all from a side panel in your inbox.\u201dOther notable features crammed into the revamped Gmail include new native offline capabilities, a task-creation tool that integrates with G Suite, and easy access to Gmail add-ons such as Intuit QuickBooks Invoicing, Dialpad, Trello, and more.Currently Google has not officially announced email scheduling, nor does the code provide any indication of when the service will arrive. How this version of Gmail for Android made its way into the public is unknown, but it\u2019s presumed legitimate given that Google cryptographically signed the app. But even if the app does contain code for message scheduling, the service likely isn\u2019t live yet, or is currently tied to just a handful of beta testers.", "id": "29"}

{"content": "A new shape could explain why epithelial cells are able to pack tightly together as they turn into the linings of our organs. It all has to do with scutoid, a prism-like cell that acts like Lego pieces. ( Nature Communications )Researchers may have just discovered a brand-new shape called the scutoid. The discovery occurred while they were studying epithelial cells, the building blocks of embryos that eventually form the linings of many organs, including the skin.Now, they have defined these cells as having the scutoid shape, and it could explain why they're able to pack tightly together and form complex, covered structures.New Geometric Shape Discovered: Here's What It Looks Like\"[The cells] are like pieces of Tente or Lego from which animals are made,\" said Luis Escudero, a developmental biologist from the University of Seville in Spain and one of the authors of the study, which was published in the Nature Communications journal.During the development of embryos, their tissues bend as they start forming into organs. Previously, scientists thought they were able to remain tightly packed if they were bottle-shaped or column-shaped, but advanced computer simulations have revealed that a more complex shape is likely.How did the researchers arrive at such a shape, though? Well, they first used a computer model that predicted which cell shapes would be most efficient in staying in contact with fellow cells in both flat or curved layers. The resulting shape ended up looking slightly similar to a prism, with six sides on one end, five on the other, and a bizarre triangular surface on one of the edges.This is what it looks like:(Photo : Nature Communications)After finding the shape, the researchers closely studied fruit fly salivary glands and zebrafish cells via microscopy and computer imaging, and they found out that these cells were indeed shaped like a scutoid. The scientists believe cells that exist in any curved sheet of epithelial cells are scutoid-shaped \u2014 even those in humans.What's In A Name?Bear in mind that the scutoid is a completely new shape in the field of science and geometry, so when the researchers found it, they were shocked.\"It was such a surprise!\" according to Escudero.Where did the name come from, though? Well, the researchers decided to base it on the scutellum of a beetle since the two look somewhat similar, the most prominent marker of which being the triangular shape at the center of a beetle's outer covering.It's not every day a new shape is discovered, so systems biologist Javier Buceta, who's credited as a co-author of the study, was grateful for the opportunity to name a new shape.\"It's not going to be the circle or the square, but we have been able to name a new shape,\" Buceta told Gizmodo.", "id": "31"}

{"content": "July 28--A man who authorities said has five prior drunken driving convictions, but was cleared of another DUI charge after refusing roadside sobriety tests, is headed to prison.Thomas Wangler, 55, was handed an 18-month sentence Thursday because he was driving with a suspended license at the time of the arrest.Besides the previous DUIs on his record, Wangler, of Algonquin, had been convicted four previous times for driving with a suspended or revoked license, according to the indictment against him in the current case.McHenry County Assistant State's Attorney Randi Freese cited Wangler's record, which she said also included convictions for aggravated battery and burglary, in seeking a three-year prison term for the defendant. Based on his criminal history and repeated violations dating back decades, he has proved \"unable to comply with terms of sentence of probation,\" she said.Wangler's attorney, Jeffrey Altman, acknowledged Wangler's criminal history but said, \"Today, he is a changed person.\"Altman said a prison term would put a \"strain on (Wangler's) family.\"The most recent case dates to March 25, 2016, when Wangler was pulled over in the Crystal Lake area after being spotted driving 11 mph over the speed limit, according to testimony at his trial this spring.The officer who made the traffic stop, McHenry County Sheriff's Deputy Jeremy Bruketta, testified that he saw an open beer in Wangler's green Cadillac and that Wangler smelled of alcohol and had glassy eyes and slurred speech.Bruketta said Wangler refused a sobriety test and became \"belligerent\" during his arrest, telling the officer to \"go get real criminals\" and \"get a real job.\"At his sentencing Thursday, Wangler told Judge Sharon Prather that he is \"ashamed of my past ... (but that) was a long time ago.\"But Prather, noting the current charges were issued in 2016, said: \"That is not so long ago.\"The judge told Wangler he \"certainly is not eligible for probation. ...

{"content": "Aug. 02--Wells Fargo has agreed to pay $2.09 billion to settle a government probe into the bank's creation of mortgages riddled with flaws, which the U.S. Department of Justice said contributed to the financial crisis that helped unleash the Great Recession, the government announced Wednesday.\"Abuses in the mortgage-backed securities industry led to a financial crisis that devastated millions of Americans,\" Acting U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California Alex Tse said in a prepared release.Wells Fargo's problems arose from the bank's decision in 2005 to launch an initiative to double its production of subprime and Alt-A loans -- mortgages that later were found to be flawed and risky, the government attorneys said. With these types of mortgages, a loan approval would be based in part on using a protocol known as \"stated income\" whereby the borrowers were obliged to simply state their income without being required to document that the income stated in the loan application was accurate.\"Today's agreement holds Wells Fargo responsible for originating and selling tens of thousands of loans that were packaged into securities and subsequently defaulted,\" Tse said.Under the terms of the agreement, Wells Fargo, without admitting liability, will pay a civil monetary penalty to resolve all civil claims available to the U.S. government, the bank said in a statement posted on its website.\"We are pleased to put behind us these legacy issues regarding claims related to residential mortgage-backed securities activities that occurred more than a decade ago,\" Wells Fargo's Chief Executive Officer Tim Sloan said in a prepared release.San Francisco-based Wells Fargo noted that a number of other U.S.-based banks had previously reached separate settlements with the Justice Department to resolve similar problems with residential mortgage-backed securities.\"Importantly, there were no claims that individual customers were harmed as a result of the alleged conduct,\" the bank said in its statement regarding the settlement.At one point, Wells Fargo launched a series of internal tests in an attempt to determine whether the honor system of \"stated income\" provided without proof by borrowers was accurate. But the tests pointed to a wide variance between the claims of borrowers and the reality.The results of Wells Fargo's 4506-T testing were disclosed in internal monthly reports, which were widely distributed among Wells Fargo employees.One Wells Fargo employee in risk management observed that the test results were \"astounding,\" according to the Justice Department announcement. The bank's risk management employee went on to say that, despite the disturbing test results, Wells Fargo decided to expand the stated income loan programs \"in all business lines.\"The bank also didn't reveal the flaws with the risky mortgages, the Justice Department stated.\"Despite its knowledge that a substantial portion of its stated income loans contained misstated income, Wells Fargo failed to disclose this information,\" government prosecutors stated. \"Wells Fargo sold at least 73,539 stated income loans that were included in residential mortgage-backed securities between 2005 to 2007, and nearly half of those loans have defaulted, resulting in billions of dollars in losses to investors.\"___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "36"}
{"content": "There\u2019s a reason why self-care is a topic of conversation in society. So many people are dealing with mental health issues and are struggling to figure out how to balance it all. For many people, their mental struggles manifest in the form of anxiety. When this happens, it\u2019s very difficult for some people to function. Anxiety can be very crippling and cause people to want to curl up and not get anything done. It\u2019s important to recognize that anxiety is a mental manifestation of a deep-rooted fear. However, it can be conquered. Anxiety does not have to get the best of you. If you have the struggle, consider these seven ways you can deal with anxiety head-on. Do these simple things when you feel anxious.1. Practice breathing exercises.If you\u2019ve ever taken a yoga class, there\u2019s a relaxation period at the end of each session. During this time, the teacher leads the students through prompted breathing exercises. Usually, this exercise happens while students lie on their backs. The teacher tends to start from the toes and go all the way up to the crown of the head. As they intentionally breathe in and out, they also relax every part of the body. Try doing this whenever you feel a sense of anxiety creeping up. If you\u2019re not in a space where you can lie down, do breathing exercises wherever you are. If you\u2019re feeling anxious, this is an exercise that can help you get through the difficult moment.     2. Exercise consistently.Exercise is excellent because it helps you to release endorphins. Endorphins naturally help people feel happier. It\u2019s also great for the moments when you feel anxious. In the mornings, try to get a workout in. It\u2019ll help you set the tone for your day. At the end of the day, it\u2019s nice to go for a walk to cool down and decompress from the day. Find ways to get physical so that you can deal with anxious mind.3. Unplug from everything.Oftentimes, people deal with an anxious mind because they are too connected to the news and the digital world. If you find that you spend a lot of time on social media, perhaps it\u2019s time to unplug. Begin to find ways to limit the amount of time that you connect with people online because it can actually lead to a sense of isolation and anxiety. Also, unplug from work. You don\u2019t want to spend most of your life working. Instead, find ways to go on vacation, enjoy family, and enjoy your present life.     4. Take it one task at a time.Make sure that you \u201cdo life\u201d one task at a time. Eliminate the temptation to multitask. When you multitask, it encourages you to constantly think about a lot of things at one time. This can contribute to the layers of angst in someone who\u2019s struggling to deal with anxious mind. Focus on the task in front of you and get it done. Then, you can move on to the next task. If you continue this type of habit, you\u2019ll find that you\u2019re able to get a lot more done. Additionally, the anxious feeling you have will decrease.5. Take breaks.It\u2019s important to take breaks. No one is a machine. As humans, it\u2019s important to take time to breathe and regroup. Consider the Pomodoro method. Set your timer for 20 minutes. Within those 20 minutes, get work done. Then, set your timer for another five minutes. During those five minutes, listen to a great song and have a dance party in your office. Or unwind with a few stretches, take a walk around the block, or drink a bottle of water. As you get acclimated to this practice, you can increase the work time from 20 minutes to 45 minutes. However, don\u2019t forget to take breaks.6. Consider the worst-case scenario.In many cases, people struggle with anxiety because they don\u2019t want to deal with the worst-case scenario. However, it\u2019s important to think everything through. What is the worst-case scenario? Once you figure out what that is, decide if it\u2019s really unbearable. In some cases, it might not be what you want; however, it\u2019s something you can deal with it. It\u2019s not the end of the world. Take a look at the full scope. Once you really get a grasp of what you\u2019re dealing with, the present moment shouldn\u2019t look so bad.7. Unload your to-do list.When you\u2019re feeling anxious, notice your pattern. Do you tend to feel a sense of anxiety after you look at your to-do list? This might be an indication that you need to unload and do less in a day. People overestimate the number of things they can do in one day and underestimate the number of things they can do in a lifetime. Pace yourself. Do not try to cram a bunch of tasks into one day. If you spread it all out, you\u2019ll be able to deal with an anxious mind and get everything done in its own time. Give yourself some slack.Closing ThoughtsAs you work on these tips, take note of the ones that seem to be the most effective. Don\u2019t be afraid to incorporate new tricks into your daily regimen to increase your level of peace and happiness. As you become determined in your pursuit of peace, you\u2019ll find that your life will change.", "id": "37"}
{"content": "CORPORATE HIJACKING. Security firm Kaspersky Lab just exposed an international cryptocurrency mining ring that is using malware software called PowerGhost to spread across vast corporate networks. The malware is infecting anything from workstations to entire server farms, using corporate hardware to dedicate a portion of the computer\u2019s power to mine a yet-unknown cryptocurrency.Once a computer is infected, a script downloads the mining tool, which uses the hardware\u2019s processing power to solve complex computational problems. The small amounts of cryptocurrency it mines gets sent back to the attacker\u2019s wallet; the virus, meanwhile, launches a copy of itself to infect other computers connected to the same network.RANSOM NO MORE. Previous analyses by Kaspersky Lab and security firm Skybox suggested that it is more profitable for cybercriminals \u2014 you know, the tinted sunglasses, hoodie-wearing type \u2014 to install cryptocurrency mining malware, rather than holding data hostage using ransomware. Browser-based cryptojacking attacks rose 80 percent in 2017, they found.The difference between these two approaches is fairly simple: mining malware uses processing power of targeted machines \u2014 anything from workstations, servers, to even point-of-sales terminals, and people\u2019s smartphones \u2014 to mine for obscure cryptocurrencies; ransomware simply locks people out of being able to access their data, threatening to bear their data for all to see. Unless of course, they pay a ransom. That\u2019s how last year\u2019s worldwide ransomware attack WannaCry worked.WORLD DOMINATION. PowerGhost is even harder to notice than other crypto-mining malware. According to Kaspersky Lab, the malware doesn\u2019t even need to use any files at all, making itself even more invisible to anti-malware and -virus software. Rather than moving files onto the targeted machine to start running mining software, PowerGhost runs a script from memory right away, and bam, it starts mining.This malware used corporate networks to spread across the entire globe as Kaspersky Lab\u2019s handy map shows:The intent is simple: the more infected computers, the more processing power available to mine more cryptocurrency. The more crypto, the bigger the reward. And as it turns out, targeting corporate networks is an extremely effective way to do just that.Unfortunately, it\u2019s not always easy to fend off \u201ccryptojacking\u201d malware. Malware communicates with servers in a way very similar to conventional, unsuspicious network communication. And on a big corporate scale, a lot of data could end up hiding the mining software quite well.If your computer in infected with PowerGhost, installing software updates and patches to avoid being vulnerable to exploits will fix it. But this is surely not the last cryptomining malware we\u2019ll see.\u201cThe miner we examined indicates that targeting consumers is not enough for cybercriminals anymore \u2013 threat actors are now turning their attention to enterprises too. Cryptocurrency mining is set to become a huge threat to the business community,\u201d principal security researcher David Emm tells ZDNet.Translation: cryptomining malware has the potential to turn into a huge headache for everyone.More about cryptomining: Crypto Mining for Charity: Your Processing Power Could Save the World", "id": "38"}
{"content": "July 27--Friday's release of a draft consent decree proposing broad reforms to the Chicago Police Department was set in motion 2 1/2 years ago by the release of video of Officer Jason Van Dyke shooting African-American teenager Laquan McDonald 16 times.Mayor Rahm Emanuel's administration fought to keep the video hidden before a judge ordered its release in November 2015. It touched off furious street protests fueled by longstanding complaints about police abuse, primarily from African-Americans and Latinos. The shooting led to rare first-degree murder charges against Van Dyke, and he is scheduled to stand trial starting Sept. 5.As the McDonald video sparked a political crisis, Emanuel at first rejected calls for an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice but reversed himself as the idea gained support.The resulting federal investigation led to a report released in January 2017. It described a broken Police Department in which badly trained cops have practiced brutality and misconduct with little to fear of their supervisors or a largely ineffectual disciplinary system.That report emerged in the last days of an Obama administration that moved aggressively to reform local police agencies. Emanuel voiced support for a consent decree, a court-supervised agreement that would govern reforms.But the Trump administration has shown no interest in intervening in local police agencies, and Emanuel last summer backed away from his support for a consent decree. The mayor argued he could bring meaningful reform to the department through an out-of-court agreement with the Trump administration involving a monitor, but activists and former Justice Department lawyers blasted that proposal, voicing skepticism that significant change would come without a judge to impose it.In August 2017, Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan stepped into the role traditionally filled by federal authorities, suing the city to force a consent decree. Emanuel said he would negotiate toward one. Black Lives Matter Chicago and the ACLU, meanwhile, brought their own lawsuits seeking to compel changes in the department. In March, the Emanuel administration and Madigan's office announced an an in-court deal giving those activist groups a role in creating and enforcing a consent decree.On Friday, Madigan and Emanuel released their draft.Now, the city and Madigan's office face a Sept. 1 deadline to file a proposed order with Judge Robert Dow, who will then hold hearings involving stakeholders and eventually rule on a final consent decree.The Chicago Fraternal Order of Police, whose leaders want the litigation over the consent decree dismissed, are seeking to intervene in the case, though Dow has yet to rule on whether the union can get involved.___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "39"}

As recent as last week, it looked as though the Cubs could be the favorite to land another Oriole, Zach Britton.Well, here we are, looking at a Cubs team with neither of those players on the roster having seen them go to fellow World Series contenders.

So, where does that leave the Cubs as we are rapidly approaching the 2018 trade deadline?The obvious need right now for the Cubs is pitching. Everybody knows that. It\u2019s no secret that this team is going to make at least one more move, even after acquiring veteran Jesse Chavez. The Cubs acquired Chavez due to his experience as both a starter and reliever, but they are going to need more.Who are the most recent names linked to the Cubs? Well, each of the last several weeks has brought new and different apparent targets.

{"content": "July 31--Jerry Leatham says he is a live and let live kind of guy.He is at peace with an anti-violence protest scheduled to shut down a section of North Lake Shore Drive during Thursday afternoon's rush hour, a march that also is expected to flow to the Wrigley Field neighborhood on a night the Cubs play the San Diego Padres.Leatham and his wife plan to attend that game, which starts at 7:05 p.m.\"I think anybody should be able to protest or walk or do whatever they want, long as they get permission,\" said Leatham, a Cubs season ticket holder for nearly four decades and a resident of Chicago's Old Town neighborhood.\"We don't drive up to the ballpark on Lake Shore Drive anyway,\" Leatham said. \"We're not that stupid.\"The couple use public transportation, cabs or ride services to get to and from games, Leatham said. And, he knows several routes in case one or two paths are crowded or closed.\"It's really not going to bother us much,\" he added.The full impact a protest might have on the game won't be known until Thursday evening. Cubs officials, though, said this week that fans should not be concerned about getting into and out of the park safely.As of Tuesday afternoon, many tickets remained available for Thursday's game on the StubHub ticket website. The cheapest were priced at $24, slightly less than tickets for this weekend's games against the Padres and less than for Friday afternoon's game, for which tickets were on sale from $33.A StubHub official did not return an email seeking comment on whether the planned protest might be having any effect on ticket sales. Workers at Gold Coast Tickets and Best Seats Available, two other ticket brokers, declined to comment.Community activists organizing the protest plan on closing the northbound lanes of the drive between Diversey Parkway and Belmont Avenue at 4 p.m. The march is expected to leave the drive at Belmont and continue west to Clark Street, then northwest to Wrigley, organizers said. Thursday also is the first day of the Lollapalooza music festival in Grant Park, about 4 1/2 miles south of the march.It remains unclear whether protesters will attempt to enter the ballpark after the 1.2-mile walk from Belmont and Lake Shore Drive. Marchers originally said they were planning to stay outside Wrigley. But one of the primary organizers of the march, the Rev. Gregory Livingston, said Monday that the final decision will be a \"surprise.\"\"Wait and see,\" Livingston said during a news conference at City Hall. He also said he expects arrests will occur during the protest.Cubs spokesman Julian Green said the organization has assured ticket holders they \"can safely enter and exit Wrigley Field without interruption.\" Most of the concerns fans have expressed to the organization center on transportation challenges that would occur if Lake Shore Drive is closed, Green said in an email.\"We are advising our guests to avoid Lake Shore Drive,\" he added.Green did not respond to a question about how many fans have contacted the team with concerns about attending the game.Guillermo Zamorano, a Cubs season ticket holder who lives in Ukrainian Village, has tickets to Thursday's game and is unsure whether he'll attend.\"If I went, it would probably be just because of the protest, getting to see that the whole thing is about,\" said Zamorano, who has owned season tickets for five years.Zamorano said he understands the urgency to stop gun violence in the city, but he disagrees with the approach of the protest.\"I don't think it's going to accomplish anything, to be honest,\" he said, except to push Lake Shore Drive traffic to other, already-congested routes around Wrigley.Apart from protesting gun violence in the city, Thursday's march has a more specific goal: the resignations of Mayor Rahm Emanuel and police Superintendent Eddie Johnson.The Chicago Police Department has jurisdiction over Lake Shore Drive, although it remains unclear how the city will respond to the protest.Thursday's demonstration would come almost four weeks after a similar march on a Saturday morning shut down a portion of the Dan Ryan Expressway on the South Side. Organizers of the Lake Shore Drive effort say they have set Thursday's march for a busy time on the more affluent, less violent North Side to \"redistribute the pain\" and give more prominence to their message.Chicago Tribune's Elvia Malagon and Morgan Greene contributed.tgregory@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "41"}
{"content": "Aug. 04--Scientists last month deployed two new buoys in Lake Michigan that have begun recording and publishing lake conditions in real-time -- for the first time -- near a north suburban harbor and marina.The buoys, placed about a mile offshore Waukegan Harbor and Winthrop Harbor's North Point Marina, are taking a variety of measurements, including wind speed, surface current, wave height and water temperatures, giving scientists and the public the first look at conditions at either location. Equipped with webcams, the buoys will also transmit a photo and a short video clip each hour during the day.Researchers hope the data from the nearshore buoys, which are curated by Illinois-Indiana Sea Grant and Great Lakes Observing System, will help them better understand coastal erosion along the northern Illinois lakefront.The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and state scientists have also been intensively studying how sand moves along the shoreline, a process that is correlated with winds and the current. Historically, sand has drifted south along the Lake Michigan shoreline and accumulated in the present-day Indiana Dunes. However, coastal development, namely harbors and marinas, have disrupted this natural process and caused unprecedented erosion in some areas.\"Nearshore waves and currents are a primary driver of shoreline erosion and accretion, thus it is critical that we have high-resolution measurements of these processes that we can compare to the other data we are collecting along the shoreline and in the nearshore,\" state coastal geologist Ethan Theuerkauf said in an email.While the buoys were funded by a grant to research this issue, they will also provide observations that will be helpful to boaters, beachgoers and fishermen who head to North Point Marina -- the largest marina in the Great Lakes -- and Waukegan Harbor, the only commercial harbor between Milwaukee and Chicago.Before these buoys were positioned, there were no real-time observations in these locations. Boaters could use estimates of lake conditions in areas based on a computer model provided by the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration. There were some land-based webcams and weather stations. Some ships share reports of lake conditions in real-time on their routes across Lake Michigan, providing perhaps the most reliable measurements, albeit only during a brief window.\"You can kind of get a feel for the wind if you see a wind sock or something blowing,\" Ed Verhamme, project engineer with LimnoTech, an environmental engineering and science consulting firm, who designed the buoys. \"You can't get a feel for if it's choppy or which way are the waves coming from. Fisherman who are hard-core, they have an intuition for the waves. But most people, they got off work at 5. They want to run out to their boats before the sun sets. So, just checking the conditions is so, so useful.\"However, even with the installation of the new buoys, some boaters have complained they would've liked for the buoys to be placed farther out. Because the buoys are located closer to shore, these shallower waters might be more sheltered from westerly winds and wouldn't be indicative of how rough the water is farther out.NOAA buoys have long been in place in deep water for the benefit of commercial shipping. A NOAA buoy moored at the center of southern Lake Michigan, 43 miles east of Milwaukee, has been in operation since 1981. In recent years, it has reported the highest wave heights since its deployment.Four of the five highest waves recorded by the mid-lake buoy have occurred since 2011. Most recently, during the Halloween 2014 storm, 59 mph winds whipped up a 21.7-foot wave, tied for the second highest recorded by the buoy. The tallest wave reported by that buoy was 22.9 feet on Sept. 30, 2011 when the Midwest was rocked by a strong storm system.These new buoys will join a growing network of floating weather monitors across the Great Lakes placed closer to the shore and yielding their own interesting findings.The Chicago Park District have six buoys that record water temperature, water depth, and waves. But the data are largely used for forecasting water quality concerns for beach closures.LimnoTech designed three buoys for Northern Michigan University that were placed in Lake Superior between 2015 and 2016. One of them, positioned near Marquette, Mich., recorded a nearly 29-foot wave in October, the highest ever recorded for any of the Great Lakes.Although nearshore buoys could be spared from tall waves when winds are blowing toward deeper waters, Verhamme said waves recorded by midlake buoys could be even taller closer to shore if winds are blowing inland. The new Lake Michigan buoys are expected to remain out on the lake from April to November in hopes of recording conditions during powerful fall storms.\"These could measure larger waves than ever before,\" Verhamme said.The new north suburban buoys were custom-made by LimnoTech and are the \"smartest, smallest\" buoys on Lake Michigan, Verhamme said. They are equipped with a cellular modem to transmit data real-time. The solar-powered devices also feature webcams similar to the security cameras installed in ATMs. And perhaps their most notable feature is that they only weigh about 300 pounds, whereas the Chicago Park District buoys weigh about 600 pounds and the NOAA's midlake buoy weighs roughly 2,000 pounds.\"These two are the smallest, most efficient for their size,\" Verhamme added.The Winthrop Harbor and Waukegan buoys were funded by a grant from NOAA awarded to the Illinois State Geological Survey at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and the Illinois Department of Natural Resources Coastal Management Program.The public can access the buoy data and current observations online or they can text the buoy's assigned number (45186 for Waukegan and 45187 for Winthrop Harbor) to 734-201-0750 to get the latest measurements.tbriscoe@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "42"}
{"content": "July 27--Welcome to Clout Street: Morning Spin, our weekday feature to catch you up with what's going on in government and politics from Chicago to Springfield. Subscribe here.TopspinChicago aldermen headed into their annual summer recess this week after introducing a flurry of measures dealing with everything from Police Department settlements to plastic straws as they look ahead to re-election contests and the municipal budget process kicking into high gear this fall.The City Council doesn't meet in August. When aldermen return from vacations after Labor Day, they'll have a full slate of proposals awaiting them.Some will be used as campaign fodder as incumbents make the pitch to voters that they're representing their ward's interests. Others could become leverage as aldermen try to get Mayor Rahm Emanuel to bend a little on the 2019 spending package. And some are just the usual flotsam and jetsam of city governance.Among the ordinances, Southwest Side Ald. Ed Burke, 14th, introduced one to try to protect immigrants living in the country without legal permission from being exploited or abused by landlords who could threaten to report them to federal immigration agents. Burke, the council's longest tenured alderman, might be facing a tough re-election fight in his majority Hispanic ward.Also in the hopper will be progressive Ald. Scott Waguespack's proposal to require the city to provide the City Council a great deal more information about proposed settlements for people accusing Chicago police of misconduct. They would have to brief aldermen about the specifics of the incident and the backgrounds of the officers involved and show any video and other evidence in the case to bridge what Waguespack, 32nd, termed the \"disconnect between the City's efforts to limit its exposure to large civil judgments and the police accountability system in Chicago.\"Ald. Proco \"Joe\" Moreno, 1st, wants to require landlords to give tenants more notice if they plan big rent increases, a common problem in his increasingly fancy ward that takes in parts of Logan Square, Wicker Park, West Town and the Ukrainian Village.Ald. Brendan Reilly, 42nd, wants to increase the distance from downtown residential buildings where loud construction equipment cannot be operated between 8 p.m. and 8 a.m., from the current 600 feet to 1,100 feet.And Burke and Ald. Raymond Lopez, 15th, want to ban city facilities from stocking plastic straws and stirrers.

People deserve an attorney general that will be independent, reform-minded and will hold both parties accountable.\"The idea of statewide grand juries to prosecute multi-county crimes, led by the attorney general, has been floated by candidates for the office for decades.

{"content": "July 29--A second firefighter has died while battling the massive Ferguson Fire burning near Yosemite, officials said Sunday afternoon.The Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park firefighter was working in an area on the east end of the Ferguson Fire with many dead trees and was struck by one of them, according to a statement from parks officials. \"He was treated on scene, but passed away before he could be transported to a hospital,\" it said.\"The team at Sequoia and Kings National Parks is devastated by this terrible news,\" Woody Smeck, the parks superintendent said in the statement. \"Our deepest condolences go out to the firefighter's family and loved ones. We grieve this loss with you.\"The firefighter's body was set to be escorted through Mariposa to the Stanislaus County Coroner's office in Modesto around 3:30 p.m. Sunday, the Mariposa County Sheriff's Office said.The Mariposa County Sheriff's Office had invited residents and visitors \"to line the streets of Mariposa in honor and support of the firefighter and our public safety partners.\"Previously, Braden Varney, a 36-year-old second-generation heavy fire equipment operator was killed battling the fire on July 14 when his bulldozer rolled down a ravine. Varney worked for the Madera-Mariposa-Merced Unit of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, also known as Cal Fire.The Ferguson Fire has scorched 53,646 acres in Mariposa County since it started on July 13, adding roughly 10,000 acres since Friday, according to fire officials. It was 30 percent contained as of Sunday afternoon, and officials said they hope to have the fire fully contained by Aug. 15.It's burning mostly in \"steep terrain loaded with fuels\" both north and south of the Merced River, according to Rob Deyerberg, a spokesperson for the unified agencies combating the fire. The terrain, combined with hot, dry weather, is posing challenges for firefighters.Crews were working on reinforcing containment lines, as well as spraying retardants, removing trees and brush before they can burn, and performing controlled burns in certain areas.\"Fire is a dynamic thing,\" Deyerberg said. \"It takes a number of tactics and a number of tools to successfully contain and suppress a wildfire like this.\"Mandatory evacuation orders for the Lushmeadows Subdivision were lifted on Friday night, but that area remains under a fire advisory.Yosemite National Park announced that Yosemite Valley will reopen to all visitors by 4 p.m. on Friday, August 3, with limited visitor services available including campgrounds, lodging, and food service operations.The Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias and Wawona Road from the south entrance of Yosemite National Park to Tunnel View will remain closed until further notice, officials said in a statement.___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "44"}
{"content": "Aug. 04--The moment has finally arrived. On Saturday night, Brian Urlacher will take the last step in his journey to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, partaking in the enshrinement ceremony for the eight-member Class of 2018.Urlacher will be joined at Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium by Ray Lewis, Randy Moss, Brian Dawkins, Bobby Beathard, Jerry Kramer and Robert Brazile. Terrell Owens is skipping this weekend's festivities.As Urlacher prepares for his big moment, not to mention his big speech, here are five things you should know:1. He doesn't know whether there will be tears when he speaks.Urlacher, 40, joked Friday that his battle to keep his tears inside will be made more challenging by his new gold-jacket-wearing fraternity brothers.\"You've got to remember there are going to be all these guys behind me telling me, 'Cry, cry, cry,' \" Urlacher said. \"I hope not. But it's going to be hard not to when I'm talking about my mom. I hope I can fight them back. But we'll see.\"Among those Urlacher hopes to thank Saturday night, his mother, Levoyda Lenard, is at the top of the list. Lenard died in 2012 at 51. But her strength in raising three kids as a single mother in New Mexico has never been lost on her Hall of Fame son.\"Without her, there's no chance I'm sitting here,\" Urlacher said. \"My work ethic, my drive to succeed was instilled by her at a very young age.\"2. He's still getting used to his Hall of Fame status.After posing Friday for the annual gold jacket photo on the steps of the Hall of Fame, Urlacher headed into a celebratory luncheon where he became a little anxious when deciding where to sit. Eventually he found himself at a table with Dan Fouts, Anthony Munoz, Mike Munchak, Bruce Matthews and Ron Wolf.\"I didn't know what to expect,\" Urlacher said. \"I sat down and was like: 'Can I sit here? Are you guys OK with me sitting here?' They were like, 'Yeah, sit wherever you want.' I thought maybe they were going to put us at a different table because we're rookies. I didn't really know where to go. I didn't really know what was going on.\"3. He has been reliving a lot of favorite moments from his Bears career this week.His favorite play, oddly, is from Week 11 of 2006, an interception in the end zone of Jets quarterback Chad Pennington in a 10-0 Bears win. It's a play, Urlacher said, that showed off his athleticism and hands.His favorite of his five career touchdowns? The 27-yard reception on a fake field goal from Brad Maynard against the Redskins in 2001.His favorite win, of course, was the 39-14 playoff defeat of the Saints that made the Bears NFC champions in January 2007 and sent them to Super Bowl XLI. Urlacher vividly remembers accepting the Halas Trophy on stage and passing it down to his teammates.\"It was snowing in the fourth quarter in front of our fans at Soldier Field. That was my favorite thing,\" he said. \"I have a picture of me handing (the trophy) down. ... You don't forget those moments with your teammates. You're passing it down. I remember handing it to Tank (Johnson). Tank couldn't wait to get his hands on it. He was passing it around to Wale (Ogunleye). It was just cool to see their faces.\"4. He was appreciative of one specific guest at his party Thursday night in Canton.Bears owner Virginia McCaskey arrived at the festivities after midnight, and Urlacher said it felt like the room stopped.\"Everyone was like, 'Whoa. That's George Halas' daughter.' And that's the way I felt,\" Urlacher said.McCaskey, 95, along with her sons George and Pat, stayed at the party for about an hour.\"That meant a lot to me and my family,\" Urlacher said.5. He's honored to be part of the same Hall of Fame class as Ray Lewis.Lewis has always been considered the standard at linebacker for his era, and there was no debate that he would get his ticket to Canton as soon as he became eligible. But Urlacher earned his respect as well and feels pride in being inducted at the same time as Lewis.\"At the lunch with the guys today, it was like, 'It doesn't matter now,' \" Urlacher said. \"We're all on the same level. We're all in the Hall of Fame.\"It doesn't matter if you go in first or 13th ballot. It doesn't matter. You're in the Hall of Fame.\"Urlacher said he looked up to Lewis while he was playing and acknowledged their different styles.\"He was a badass on the field,\" Urlacher said. \"He was a guy that liked to talk before the games. I didn't. We were different in that. He was (also) a good dancer. If I could dance like that, I would dance too. I'm a huge fan of his.\"dwiederer@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "45"}
{"content": "Aug. 02--The old Cook County Hospital building, a Beaux Arts landmark once threatened with demolition, is expected to take the first step toward city landmark status Thursday, boosting a conversion of the long-vacant structure into hotels, medical offices and retail space.The Commission on Chicago Landmarks also is expected to back giving a property tax break, aimed at encouraging historic preservation, to the developers of the old hospital's renovation.The incentive also is likely to be extended to the planned redevelopment of the long-shuttered Uptown Theatre, an eclectic movie palace at 4816 N. Broadway.Located at 1835 W. Harrison St. and completed in 1914, old Cook County Hospital embedded itself in the public consciousness as the basis for the popular television series ER. Designed by Cook County architect Paul Gerhardt, the eight-story building is 550 feet long, the rough equivalent of a 50-story skyscraper turned on its side.In 2003, then-Cook County Board President John Stroger sought to demolish the building, claiming it was outdated. But other members of the Cook County Board, including Larry Suffredin, blocked Stroger's plan, and the hospital was mothballed, awaiting the day when developers could fund a rehab.That happened in May, when the Civic Health Development Group, a team led by Murphy Development Group, confirmed that it had secured about $135 million in financing to renovate the building.A key part of its financing is a Cook County property tax incentive that has led to hundreds of millions of dollars in investments in historic buildings.That incentive also would boost the $75 million renovation of the Uptown Theatre, a project supported by Mayor Rahm Emanuel.The proposed renovation is a joint venture between Chicago-based promoter Jam Productions and Farpoint Development.The plan, announced in June, is for the 4,381-seat theater to feature a variety of live events, such as concerts.The City Council would have to give final approval to the commission's recommendation that the developers benefit from the incentive.The old hospital's renovation is expected to be complete by summer 2020.The commission's meeting is scheduled to begin at 12:45 p.m.Blair Kamin is a Tribune critic.bkamin@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "46"}
{"content": "Aug. 03--Chalk comes off asphalt pretty quick. A little rain and it's gone.That's my concern about the chalk-drawn slogans and statements that protesters fed up with daily carnage on the South and West sides left behind on the safe streets of the city's North Side.Lake Shore Drive, which the protesters managed to shut down on a busy Thursday afternoon, was marked with dusty phrases. Black Lives Matter. Help My Community. No More Violence.Same with the streets outside Wrigley Field, where the protesters finished their march. Big blue letters with a chalky yellow outline: \"ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.\"Good messages. Important messages, delivered right into a part of the city where few could even begin to grasp the daily stress and pain that exist in the violent parts of Chicago walled off from the well-heeled.But they were messages in chalk. And they'll be gone quickly. The breeze of passing cars, a quick summer storm or a street sweeper will erase them, and no visible reminder of Thursday's protest will remain. Life on the North Side will go on as usual and the routine murders in swaths of the South and West sides will continue, and I'm not at all convinced that memories of the roughly 200 people who marched, hoping to force fellow Chicagoans to pay attention to their plight, will linger.That's why I hope the Rev. Gregory Livingston, one of the protest's organizers, meant it when he stood outside Wrigley Field and prayed: \"God, you are with us, and God, we have only just begun.\"Thursday's traffic-snarling protest, like the larger anti-violence protest in July that shut down the northbound Dan Ryan Expressway, needs to be only the beginning. Both events drew national attention to Chicago and its violence epidemic. National attention like that tends to rattle powerful people, and this city's powerful people deserve ample rattling.The phrase organizers of Thursday's protest used to distill their goal was brilliant and precise: \"Redistribute the pain.\"They wanted to come to the part of Chicago that isn't plagued by violence and peacefully create some inconvenience. Were you frustrated sitting in traffic on Lake Shore Drive? That stinks, but try living in a neighborhood where the routine sound of gunfire leaves children with post-traumatic stress disorder.Was it difficult for you to get to the Cubs game? Probably not as difficult as living in poverty in an area with no economic opportunities, high crime and little hope.Life in the neighborhoods many of the protesters came from is hell, daily, and those neighborhoods are as much a part of Chicago as Wrigleyville. That was kind of the point of this novel protest.For years on end I've seen protests, prayer vigils and marches around the scenes of deadly shootings in North Lawndale and Englewood, Austin and Back of the Yards. Nobody with the power to act listened. Few paid attention.In fact, those who look on Chicago's poor communities with disdain would often trot out the line: \"Why don't people in those neighborhoods ever protest the violence?\"They do, often. But the ignorant few who raise such questions never bother to see it happen.So bringing the protests out of the violent communities and into the safe ones is a logical next step. It's going to make some people mad, and that might be good. It's going to make some people more aware of the depth of this problem, and that would certainly be good.But the only way these peaceful protests are going to work is if they persist. A one-day interstate traffic jam makes a fleeting statement. A Thursday afternoon Lake Shore Drive detour isn't redistributing enough pain to leave a bruise on anyone's memory.The communities being ignored have blood on their streets, not chalk. Blood can be washed away just as well, but it leaves a memory of what happened in that spot. A community doesn't forget where a child was murdered, or where a brother or sister, husband or wife, took his or her last breath.There's so much pain in these neighborhoods you could never redistribute it all, nor would you want to.But the activists and preachers and organizers who have started bringing their protests out of the shadows, the ones prepared to make life difficult in places where things are easy -- they're on to something. For too long, this violence has endured. For too long, powerful people in this city have ignored it while politicians have offered up wildly incomplete solutions to win votes.Anyone who has tuned out the deadly day-in-and-day-out toll on the streets of our city needs to be rattled, needs to be made to feel uncomfortable. Cries of help from street corners most will never pass have, of course, gone unheard.What choice remains but to get louder, to force others to notice?Those white and yellow chalk slogans on Lake Shore Drive will vanish quickly.But I hope, as the Rev. Livingston said, that these protests have only just begun.rhuppke@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "47"}
{"content": "Vince Carter chases leadership over rings as the 41-year-old has reportedly agreed to a one-year deal with the Atlanta Hawks.We haven\u2019t seen the last of Vinsanity just yet. According to ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski, Vince Carter has agreed to a one-year deal with the Atlanta Hawks for the veteran\u2019s minimum of $2.4 million.Wojnarowski reports that Atlanta values Carter\u2019s leadership and wants him around their young locker room. Carter took on a similar role with the Sacramento Kings last season.The 41-year-old averaged 5.4 points, 2.6 rebounds, and 1.2 assists in 58 games for the Kings last season.The Hawks finished last in the Eastern Conference in 2017-18 and don\u2019t figure to be much better this season. They shipped out starting point guard Dennis Schroder to Oklahoma City, replacing him with 2018 No. 5 overall pick Trae Young and veteran Jeremy Lin.Along with Young, the Hawks drafted shooting guard Kevin Heurter with the No. 19 pick. Heurter figures to see plenty of time coming off the bench behind Kent Bazemore.Taurean Prince, 24, and John Collins, 20, give Atlanta a young core in search of direction. The addition of Carter and subtraction of Schroder should stabilize a locker room that lost its way following the departures of Paul Millsap and Al Horford.As a trivia note, Carter and Carmelo Anthony are officially teammates for the time being. Anthony\u2019s contract will be bought out in the coming days.While most players his age latch on to a team with championship aspirations, Carter is proving his priorities are elsewhere. We should all admire Carter for not signing the Warriors in order to add a ring to resume. The real question is, how come the Lakers didn\u2019t sign him?", "id": "48"}
{"content": "Aug. 01--Hand, foot and mouth disease is in the news with Yankees pitcher J.A. Happ becoming the second Major League Baseball pitcher afflicted in the last two weeks. Mets pitcher Noah Syndergaard was the first player to get felled by the ailment, reportedly after visiting a children's camp. But doctors say it's vital to understand that the group most vulnerable to this sickness is children under 10.Unfortunately, this viral illness, which is highly contagious and often painful, is on the rise just as parents start to think about sending the kids back to school, which is a prime place to catch it. Doctors are advising parents to be careful and to make sure their children know how to prevent contracting the disease.\"It's picked up easily in day care centers, especially,\" according to Dr. Trachella Johnson Foy, a family physician for Baptist Health in Jacksonville, Florida told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. \"Of course, with us getting back to school -- the elementary school children are going to be at a high risk.\"Generally consisting of a fever, a general malaise, blister-like legions and a red rash that develops in the mouth or sores on the hands and feet, the sickness usually runs its course in three to five days. As the Mayo Clinic cites, people hit with the virus are most contagious during the first week, but it can remain in the body for weeks after symptoms and signs are gone. Adults can often pass the virus (by coughing or sneezing) without showing any symptoms of the ailment.For Lindsay Schroedter, whose whole family has been struck ill at the same time, the misery started when her son Aidan, 8, came home with little red spots that looked like bug bites after playing at the park.\"He had a fever,\" says the Dublin mother of two. \"Then next day the 'bug bites' appeared all over his hands and feet and he had a sore throat. Then the fever went away and the spots blistered. He had a hard time walking because of the blisters on the soles of his feet. A few weeks later my daughter got it.\"Now they all have it, including Schroedter's mother and husband, whose throat is so inflamed he is having trouble eating.\"The skin is peeling of our hands as though we are shedding our winter coat. It's gross,\" says Schroedter, who says she probably got it from her baby daughter Avery, 1. \"My daughter kisses us all the time and shares our drinks so I'm sure that's how my mom and I got it from her.\"Prevention is simple, although it's just the sort of thing kids have trouble remembering to do. Washing your hands carefully is a key part of not spreading the virus. Cover your face when you cough or sneeze and never share food and drinks. Parents and teachers are also advised to disinfect common areas regularly, including shared items such as toys because the virus can live on these objects for days.Keep in mind that it's very important to stay home from school or work if you think you may have it to prevent the outbreak from widening.___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "49"}

{"content": "Black Lotus, a card from the Alpha set of the 'Magic: The Gathering' trading card game, was sold in an eBay auction for $87,672. What made the piece of cardboard reach such an exorbitant price? ( PWCC Auctions | eBay )A card from the Magic: The Gathering trading card game recently sold for an eye-popping $87,672 in an eBay auction, an overwhelming amount of money for a piece of cardboard.Magic: The Gathering cards have different rarities and prices, ranging from cents to hundreds of dollars, and in certain cases, up to the thousands. Here's why that specific card reached nearly $100,000 on eBay.Black Lotus From 'Magic: The Gathering' Sold For $87,672A card named Black Lotus, from the very first Magic: The Gathering set released in 1993, was recently put up for auction on eBay. The bidding ended at a whopping $87,672, a crazy amount for a small piece of cardboard.For those who are unfamiliar with Magic: The Gathering and its history, the trading card game started with three sets that were printed in 1993: Alpha, Beta, and Unlimited. Alpha contained a total of 295 cards with black borders, Beta came with seven additional cards and some error fixes, and Unlimited was a reprint of Beta but with white borders. Black Lotus was included in each set, which were mostly sold in packs of 15 random cards.Unlimited has a massive print run compared to Alpha and Beta, so Black Lotus cards from that expansion is more common. An Unlimited Black Lotus reaches prices of $8,000, which is still very expensive but nowhere near the ending price of the Alpha Black Lotus.The Alpha Black Lotus, meanwhile, saw a very limited print run. Only 1,100 copies of each rare card in the Alpha set were printed, including Black Lotus. It is unknown how many of those Alpha Black Lotus cards have survived to this day, but it is very rare to see one of them being sold in the open market.Making this particular Alpha Black Lotus even more rare is that it has been graded 9.5 Gem Mint by the Beckett collectible grading service. It would be difficult to find one of just over 1,000 cards released 25 years ago, but even more difficult, and perhaps nearly impossible, to find another one in top condition like the $87,672 card.Will The Alpha Black Lotus See Play?Black Lotus is not an expensive card just for its rarity, as it is also one of the most powerful cards ever printed for Magic: The Gathering. It is considered to be part of the Power 9, which is generally accepted by players as the nine most powerful cards in the game.There is practically no chance that the $87,672 Alpha Black Lotus will ever see its true purpose of being played in a Magic: The Gathering game though. Aside from the fact that the card is legal only in Vintage, Magic: The Gathering's most limited and expensive format, players around the world will get a heart attack if they see the Alpha Black Lotus taken out of its hard case and being shuffled like a one-cent card.", "id": "52"}
{"content": "July 30--The family of a man fatally shot last month by a Chicago police officer in an incident captured on video filed a lawsuit Monday alleging he was shot three times while unarmed.The video, made public last week by police oversight officials, showed the tactical officer fatally shooting Maurice Granton Jr., 24, as he tried to scale a fence while running from police June 6 in the Bronzeville neighborhood.Attorneys Antonio Romanucci and Andrew Stroth said the body camera video never shows Granton armed, even though police described the incident as an \"armed confrontation.\"Granton never posed an imminent threat to officers, the lawyers contended.At the time of the incident, police said Granton ignored orders to stop during a foot chase, pulled a weapon and fired at the officer before he was shot.The lawsuit, filed in Cook County Circuit Court, names the city and Officer Sheldon Thrasher as defendants.Documents released last week by the Civilian Office of Police Accountability identified Thrasher as the officer who fatally shot Granton. Records show the African-American officer joined the department in 2013.COPA, the city agency that investigates police-involved shootings, released the video last week after Granton's family viewed the footage.The shooting remains under investigation.Department officials said that both Thrasher and a second officer involved in the shooting have returned to active duty after taking a mandatory 30-day leave following the incident.In a statement last week, Chicago police noted that COPA has not requested that any of the officers involved in the incident be relieved of police powers and placed on desk duty.Department officials said the Wentworth District tactical officers were in the area conducting a narcotics investigation when they were directed to the 300 block of East 47th Street.Surveillance footage showed Granton and others milling around under the CTA Green Line before a police car pulled up and the men scattered.The body camera from one officer captured him saying, \"Come here, man,\" and then chasing after Granton, who jumped a wooden fence, leaving the view of that officer's body camera. That officer abandoned the chase, shouting in pain. The view from his camera indicated he was limping away.But his camera captured the sound of a single gunshot, then a pause, followed by three more shots in quick succession.The body camera footage posted from the officer who appears to have opened fire did not include audio at the time of the shooting.That video showed Granton running across a vacant lot and darting onto a wrought iron fence with one leg raised. As both hands reached for the top of the fence, the officer can be seen raising his gun. The footage then showed Granton immediately fall from the fence, stumble to his left a few feet and then drop to the ground, writhing in pain.Granton was shot in the back, according to the Cook County medical examiner's office. Authorities have not said how many times Granton was shot.A use-of-force report filed by Thrasher -- released by COPA along with other audio and video evidence -- said he reported to supervisors that Granton was armed with a semi-automatic pistol and fired on him.His body camera video included audio in the moments after the shooting, and the officer who fired can be heard pointing other officers to a gun near Granton.Thrasher was heard on the video encouraging Granton to \"stay woke.\"In comments to reporters last week, Granton's father said his son was \"left on the ground like an animal.\"\"I'm just seeking justice,\" he said. \"It was a coldblooded murder.\"The Police Department released a limited video shortly after the shooting that it said showed Granton holding a gun sometime before he was shot by the officer. The department also tweeted out a photo of a 9 mm handgun it said was recovered.Granton was pronounced dead at University of Chicago Medical Center. He had been treated at the same hospital just days before for a graze wound near his right eye. He refused to cooperate with police after officers found him lying in an alley in the South Side's Chatham neighborhood, authorities said then.Granton had two convictions for robbery and theft and several arrests on suspicion of trespassing and drug possession. His last arrest was in 2016, records show.But his family said that with the birth of two daughters in recent years, Granton had put his criminal behavior in the past.jgorner@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "53"}
{"content": "Aug. 04--Would-be carjackers in a white Mercedes tried to steal three cars -- and successfully got away with one -- in less than 45 minutes in separate North Side incidents Saturday morning, according to Chicago police.Police initially said no vehicles had been taken, but that information was later corrected.In all three incidents, a white Mercedes SUV was involved, and a passenger got out and showed the victims a gun, police said.The first occurred about 7:15 a.m. in the 1400 block of West Webster Avenue in the Sheffield Neighbors neighborhood, said Officer Norma Pelayo, a spokeswoman for Chicago police. A 29-year-old man was in his parked car when another man, described as being in his early 20s, came up from behind and threatened him with what he believed to be a gun, Pelayo said. The victim got out of his car, and the carjacker got in and drove away, police said.Just 20 minutes later in the 3500 block of North Southport Avenue in Lakeview, a 62-year-old woman was sitting in her car when a man pointed a black handgun at her, police said. She got out of the car and ran -- but when the would-be carjacker got in, he was unable to get her car into gear and fled the scene shortly afterward into the white Mercedes, police said.And at 7:55 a.m., a 20-year-old man was in his parked car in the 2700 block of North Sheffield Avenue in the Wrightwood Neighbors neighborhood. A man in his 20s approached, pulled a black pistol from his waistband and pointed it at him, demanding he get out of the car. The victim complied, but once the carjacker was inside the vehicle he could not turn it on, police said. He left and was seen entering the white Mercedes.Police did not release detailed descriptions of the suspects, and nobody is in custody.___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "54"}

{"content": "July 31--SAN DIEGO -- Fewer than 90 minutes before the deadline, manager Bruce Bochy said it's \"all quiet on the western front,\" in the Giants clubhouse and he anticipates the 25 players on the roster now are the 25 players he'll start Tuesday's game with in San Diego.Right fielder Andrew McCutchen's name has come up in trade speculation in the days leading up to the deadline, but McCutchen is penciled into the leadoff spot for Tuesday's 1:10 p.m. game and all signs indicate the pending free agent will remain with the Giants into the month of August.Other players including relievers Will Smith, Tony Watson and Sam Dyson may be viewed as attractive assets for clubs looking to add bullpen help, but the Giants have given no indication they intend to sell.The situation is certainly fluid as the Giants could be blown away by an offer or make a last-minute push to pick up an outfielder, starting pitcher or additional bullpen arm, but the franchise is unlikely to acquire any players making a significant salary.With fewer than 45 minutes to go before the deadline, Jon Heyman of Fancred linked San Francisco to Reds starting pitcher Matt Harvey.If the Giants do make any late-summer additions or subtractions to their roster, they could be more inclined to pursue opportunities with deals after the non-waiver deadline. Should San Francisco fall out of the National League West and National League Wildcard races, players like McCutchen and Dyson could be placed on waivers and traded to other clubs.Barring any late surprises that shake up the roster, Bochy is hoping Giants players take a quiet deadline as a vote of confidence in the current roster and the team's abilities to make a late push.\"That's what you're hoping, we still feel that we're in this and we have a chance to get to where we want to go,\" Bochy said.The Giants have made at least one trade prior to the non-waiver deadline each year since 2013. Last season, the Giants traded infielder Eduardo Nunez to the Boston Red Sox in exchange for two pitching prospects, including starter Shaun Anderson who was recently promoted to Triple-A Sacramento.Giants rotation undeterminedBochy said the Giants could have a decision regarding how they'll treat veteran Johnny Cueto's right elbow sprain within the next day.The Giants manager said Monday Tommy John surgery is a 'strong possibility' after Cueto revealed he's experiencing pain in his elbow after every pitch.With Cueto on the 10-day disabled list and expected to miss an extended period of time, the Giants have listed Madison Bumgarner as their starter for Thursday's game in Arizona and have left the rest of their weekend rotation as \"to be announced.\"If the Giants avoid using right-hander Chris Stratton out of the bullpen Tuesday, Bochy said Stratton will likely start Friday's game against the D'backs.___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "56"}
{"content": "Once upon a time, an iPhone was the most sought-after fashion accessory of every cool kid on the block. That's the longstanding clich\u00e9 about Apple (AAPL) fans, at least, and one that's paid off handsomely for Apple and its shareholders. Apple sold 216.76 million iPhones last year. Between 2008 and now, iPhone sales have swelled from less than 10% of Apple's total revenue to about 62% as of last quarter, and in that time, Apple's stock has skyrocketed roughly 900% and is inching towards a $1 trillion market cap. But the underlying trend is changing. The iPhone X -- Apple's ultra-premium model that it rolled out last September, also marking the 10th anniversary of the device -- hasn't exactly lit the world on fire. iPhone X sales have been under the microscope since supplier reports suggested weak demand for the $1,000-and-up phone last holiday season. \"If I were to compare it to some years ago, when Steve Jobs was still with Apple, then yes -- the coolness factor has gone down,\" says analyst Tom Forte of DA Davidson.  Even the most devoted iPhone users aren't rushing to drain their wallets on the latest and greatest from Apple. Logan Abbott, who runs the popular smartphone comparison engine Wirefly, says that the iPhone still dominates among his site's users, included in 54% of all searches, as opposed to 16% for the comparably-priced Samsung (SSNLF) Galaxy and Note lines. But interest in the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus outshines that for the iPhone X, with the latter included in only 20% of all iPhone searches. \"Prior to its introduction, I think expectations were too high. We thought it was going to be a game-change; it ended up being more incremental,\" Forte adds. \"It's becoming increasingly difficulty to have a wow factor.\" That, combined with overall market saturation of smartphones compared to a few years ago, mean that users aren't as jazzed about some of the features exclusive to the iPhone, like a 'super-retina' display, FaceID and lack of home button. What was heart-stopping passion in 2008 has settled into plain old routine: \"Most iPhone users are so tied into the Apple ecosystem that they don't even bother looking for another manufacturer that will cause them to have to learn an entire new operating system,\" says Abbott. Accordingly, Apple is using its resources to double down on that ecosystem, emphasizing its 'services' segment -- which includes iTunes, App Store, AppleCare, iCloud, Apple Pay. In May, Apple reported revenue of $9.2 billion from that segment and has been also spending big to build out a yet-to-be-announced media streaming service, possibly with Oprah Winfrey anchoring it.   Apple's iPhone vs. services quandary is igniting debate as Apple prepares to releases its Q2 earnings on July 31 after market close, with some analysts welcoming a post-iPhone paradigm shift for Apple and others, like Forte, expressing some worry that Apple isn't ready for a future where \"your phone isn't the control center of a connected universe,\" with devices such as Amazon's (AMZN) Echo and Google (GOOGL) Home on the rise. Either way, it's clear that Apple's future isn't riding on ever-tinier bezels and dazzling displays.  \"Cool is less important today as being connected all the time; it's almost a mission-critical issue, not a cool thing anymore,\" said Allen Adamson, a professor at NYU Stern School of Business. \"When your phone breaks, you want to go to an Apple store and have someone in a blue shirt hand you a new one.\"  For a phone-addicted generation there might be nothing cooler than a solid battery life and a readily available customer service department.  Either Apple just isn't as cool as it used to be -- or its users are just growing up.  Alphabet, Amazon.com and Apple are holdings in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS member club.

{"content": "July 30--Orlando Campos was tired of carrying around his bulky Mexican passport everywhere and thought getting a Chicago municipal ID, similar in size and appearance to a driver's license, might be easier to tote around.Campos, 39, spent an hour in line on a recent morning waiting for the ID, formally known as a CityKey card. His time in the queue at City Hall is but one snapshot of how sluggish the pace has been to issue the cards.Since the program -- touted by Mayor Emanuel as an option for immigrants and others -- rolled out in May, more than 11,200 cards have been issued, which translates to less than 1 percent of the city's 2.7 million residents; anyone from babies on up are eligible for the IDs. That also means that it's likely the city won't reach its goal of handing out 100,000 free cards for at least a year.The city clerk's office is tasked with overseeing the program, and employees have made changes in an effort to streamline and speed up the process, said Jose Sanchez Molina, a spokesman for the department. You can apply for the card either at City Hall or one of the roving mobile sites, though the latter sees the longest lines. To curb those lines, the office now puts an estimate online of how many cards can be printed that day. That way, when applicants arrive they can quickly calculate whether they have a shot that day or should try some other time, Sanchez Molina said.Anywhere from 75 to 300 cards can be printed in a day depending on how many specialized printers are available, said Kwadwo Anane, the newly hired director of the program. The office has a total of six specialized printers.At City Hall, appointments made online are now in 30-minute increments rather than 5-minute windows, the latter was too short and contributed to the wait times or, in some cases, prompted those who thought they were tardy to skip the appointment altogether, Sanchez Molina said.Cardholders like Adriana Velazquez, 27, of Back of the Yards have seen some hiccups. She recently went with her mother -- also a CityKey card holder -- to an area bank, but her mother wasn't allowed to use the card as a form of identification because they didn't recognize it.Sanchez Molina said the clerk's office is working with the city's business affairs and consumer protection department to send out materials to familiarize businesses with the card and educate them about how it could be used as a form of identification.But the ID has gotten Velazquez back in a library -- the card serves as a library card, too. She said she hadn't wandered into one for years, though she was welcomed back with a bill for overdue fees.\"I hadn't been back in awhile,\" said Velazquez, a community organizer for the Southwest Organizing Project, which was part of a CityKey pilot program. \"So this was an opportunity to get back and pull out some books.\"She said the municipal cards have helped those who could be nervous to pull out an ID card issued by their home country's local consulate -- a giveaway that they're an immigrant. Although Chicago is considered a sanctuary city, she's heard of cases where people still routinely get asked about their immigration status.\"It's very scary,\" Velazquez said. \"It becomes 'who can I trust?' No person can ask you for documents, but it still happens.\"Anane said the office has also worked to issue cards to populations that might not have any form of identification such as homeless people and people who have recently finished serving time in prison.emalagon@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "58"}
{"content": "July 31--Amazon might be on the way toward becoming more like Netflix and Hulu, at least in one way.The company's Prime Video streaming service seems to be headed for a major revamping, according to comments from Amazon Studios head Jennifer Salke at the annual Television Critics Association gathering in Beverly Hills. According to the trade publication Deadline, Salke didn't give many details about how the next iteration of the Prime interface will look, but suggested it will be an improvement over Amazon's current streaming video app.While Amazon has gained a reputation for the quality of its original programs, such as \"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,\" \"Transparent\" and \"The Man in the High Castle,\" and has built up anticipation for the series \"Jack Ryan\" and Julia Roberts' upcoming program \"Homecoming,\" the service is seen as lacking when it comes to offering personalized program suggestions.Netflix and Hulu are known for how much emphasis they put on personalizing program offerings based on what a viewer has previously watched, but Amazon's interface focuses more on broad program genres and promoting Prime content.Also, unlike Netflix and Hulu, Amazon currently doesn't allow for subscribers to set up individual viewer profiles so that different family members can get their own program recommendations, nor does it allow parents an option to block content for their children.Salke didn't say when the new Prime interface would launch, but she said she had been using a prototype of the app on her own phone.___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "59"}
{"content": "Beer is big business, but maybe not for so long. With the American consumer shifting toward liquor and spirits from good old brewskis, it may be high time for the world's biggest beer companies to make changes. Dutch brewer Heineken NV made a push to offset some of this lag on Friday, with the announcement that it would join forces with China Resources Beer in a bid to take advantage of the world's biggest beer market. \"As a whole, Heineken has done well within the brewing industry in regards to maintaining earnings growth,\" writes David Butler, a columnist on TheStreet's sister site Real Money. \"But I worry that the rather slower macroeconomic state of the industry will have adverse effects on Heineken's long-term bottom line.\" China's beer market is now the second-largest premium beer market globally and is forecast to be the biggest contributor to premium volume growth in the next five years, with profitability expected to improve significantly, driven by premiumization, demand for international beer brands and cost optimization, Heineken said. Still, China has proved difficult for foreign beer companies, notes The Deal's Lisa Botter. In December, Japan's Asahi Group Holdings Ltd. agreed to sell its 19.99% stake in China's Tsingtao Brewery Group Co. Ltd. for \u00a5106 billion ($941.2 million), after a review of its beer business investments in the country. Budweiser parent ABInBev (BUD)  on the other hand has had some successes in China though its presence still dwarfs the market share it has in its home market or in South and Central America. Nestle is crazy about the U.S. consumer and its quest for supremacy in the largest consumer market in the world is one that keeps at least one company executive up at night. \"There is a profound change in the way consumers are eating, what eat and how they eat, and how they shop... and there is a big change in the consumer expectations of brands,\" said Nestle USA Chief Strategy Officer Rui Barbas in an interview with The Deal's Botter. The company continues to evolve its portfolio, propelled the last 18 months by acquisitions, including coffee chain Blue Bottle Coffee Inc.; drinks maker Chameleon Cold-Brew; bought plant-based food maker Sweet Earth and Starbuck (SBUX)  retail coffee business outside its coffee shops. \"You see us leveraging acquisitions, not only for the sake of acquisitions but to evolve our portfolio towards where the consumer is going from a growth standpoint,\" Barbas said. Assets attractive to Nestle, however, may also be in the crosshairs of other consumer giants that seek to shape their portfolio around more high-growth businesses, see Hershey (HSY)  , Mars, Mondelez (MDLZ)  , and others' recent deals. So it remains to be seen if Nestle can continue its portfolio reshuffle, especially while also dealing with pressure from Dan Loeb's Third Point, to sell assets faster and further simplify its corporate structure. Markets Today: U.S. equity markets rose as the latest jobs report showed a steady stream of hiring gains and a solid outlook for economic growth, offsetting concerns about an expanding trade war between the U.S. and China. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.4% to 25,429, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 0.4% and the Nasdaq edged up 0.05%. Nonfarm payrolls rose by 157,000, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics said Friday in a statement. Investors evidently didn't care that that figure fell shy of the 192,500 average estimate of economists in a FactSet survey, and also represented a slowdown from the 213,000 jobs added the prior month.", "id": "60"}

{"content": "The Toronto Raptors have been waiting for LeBron James to leave the conference. With his departure, did Toronto need to make the Kawhi Leonard trade?Last season, the Toronto Raptors were the best team in the Eastern Conference before being swept by LeBron James. The team won 59 games and looked good in the first-round of the playoffs.The enjoyment was brief. In the second round, LeBron imposed his will once again. He embarrassed the Toronto Raptors with a four game sweep.LeBron is now gone. With the best player in the league out of their conference, did Toronto really need to risk DeMar DeRozan in the Kawhi Leonard trade? The answer is yes.From the moment the Raptors were eliminated from the 2018 Playoffs, Masai knew something needed to change. Last season\u2019s \u201cculture reset\u201d, although only being tested for a year, had no impact on Toronto\u2019s fortunes.Bigger GoalsOnce the rumors started, several people were looking forward to a future without Lebron in the East.That wasn\u2019t enough for the Raptors. They weren\u2019t just going to sit still and see how next season played out. They wanted to be able to compete and play the type of basketball the rest of the NBA has been playing for years. Trading for Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green seemed like the best option to make this happen.It definitely would be an accomplishment for the Raptors to finally make an NBA Finals, but the ultimate goal is to compete for a championship. The team needed to be built to compete with not only the Eastern Conference but every single team in the NBA.Yes, LeBron is in the Western Conference. But if your goals are big enough, he is still an obstacle.Filling team needsThe Raptors defense fell apart in the postseason. It was one of the reasons they played so poorly in the series vs the Cavaliers. It\u2019s something that Kawhi and Danny Green both bring to the table.Combine both players with the defensive abilities of OG Anunoby, Pascal Siakam, and Fred Vanvleet and the Raptors should be one of the best defensive teams in the NBA.Offensively, Toronto should be fine. Nick Nurse was hired to build on what he started last year, and although losing DeMar DeRozan and Jakob Poeltl puts a dent in last year\u2019s system, adding one of the league\u2019s best scorer\u2019s Kawhi makes up for that.In the long run DeMar\u2019s contract only lasted two or three more years (Player option for year three). If the Raptors were not able to produce once his contract came to an end, there is no doubt that Masai would have begun a rebuild, with the expiring contracts of Kyle Lowry and Serge Ibaka as well. Kawhi may only be guaranteed for a year but that\u2019s a gamble the Raptors needed to make.", "id": "63"}

The announcement came at the AMC presentation for the Television Critics Association summer press tour on Saturday. Fear the Walking Dead was rebooted in its fourth season as veteran showrunner Dave Erickson left the show and new showrunners Andrew Chambliss and Ian Goldberg took the show in a fresh new direction with a group of new survivors interacting with the original cast. This decision was met with a combination of elation and criticism from fans who either loved or hated the dueling timelines. However, the biggest and most controversial moment of the first half of season 4 came when fans worst fears were confirmed when Clark family matriarch Madison sacrificed herself to save her family. Now that the timelines have converged and a new group of survivors has been formed, there will be even more new faces in the second half of season 4. This time around, not all of the new faces will be friendly, forcing Alicia and Morgan and the other survivors to question who they can trust. There will also be a new nemesis in the form of a major hurricane that will challenge the survivors to the core.Though ratings look at the outset to be lower than previous seasons, Fear the Walking Dead\u2019s ratings improved in the front half of season 4. AMC recognizes that growth and has rewarded the show with another season. The reality is that the television landscape has changed dramatically over the course of the past ten years, and with streaming services on the rise the demand for eyeballs (both in live viewings and delayed DVR viewings) is at a fever pitch. Like as not, Fear has been performing admirably in its Sunday time slot, besting HBO\u2019s new flagship Westworld and claiming the top spot more than once.Fear the Walking Dead returns for the second half of season 4 on August 12, 2018.", "id": "64"}
{"content": "The MLB trade deadline is less than 48 hours away and the Philadelphia Phillies are still looking to upgrade a couple positions of need. One of the positions that the Phillies were looking to acquire was an infielder.   Over the last couple of weeks, the Phillies were rumored to be interested in Eduardo Escobar, Mike Moustakas, and Asdrubal Cabrera. All guys who can provide some offensive firepower to their lineup.    The Phillies missed out on Escobar, who was traded to the Arizona Diamondbacks earlier in the week but were able to grab Cabrera. Philadelphia acquired the New York Mets second baseman on Friday in exchange for minor league pitcher Franklyn Kilome.   This season with the Mets, Cabrera was slashing .277/.329/.488 with 18 home runs and 58 RBIs. Cabrera will be splitting time between shortstop and second baseman with the Phillies.    He made his debut on Saturday night against the Cincinnati Reds, going 0-for-4 with a strikeout. With the infielder issue solved for the Phillies, they can now turn their attention to acquiring a fourth outfielder. Last week, it was reported that Philadelphia was talking with the Toronto Blue Jays about Curtis Granderson and considering a trade for Adam Jones out of the Baltimore Orioles.  While there has not been much discussion about Granderson, we did find out something new information about Jones.  According to Dan Connelly of The Athletic, the Phillies, Cleveland Indians, along with other multiple teams have contacted the Orioles to see if the 13-year veteran would waive his 10-5 rights and accept a trade. To no avail, it seems like Jones will be staying in Baltimore for the rest of the season. \"Based on information gathered from multiple sources, it doesn't appear Jones is going anywhere, at least not for the remainder of this season,\" wrote Connelly in his latest story. If Jones does want to stay in Baltimore, then the Phillies must turn their attention to other options. Is Joey Gallo a better option for the Phillies? Another one of those outfield options could be Joey Gallo of the Texas Rangers. Evan Grant of the Dallas Morning News reported that the Phillies along with the Indians are expressing the most interest in the 24-year-old infielder/outfielder. This season, Gallo is only slashing .191/.307/.465, but has 26 home runs and 59 RBIs. Not to mention, he already has 139 strikeouts and 54 walks through 100 games.  None of these numbers are appealing and actually go against the Phillies' offensive model. However, what does have teams interested is Gallo's contract situation and his ability to play multiple positions. Aforementioned, he is only 24-years-old, but could become arbitration-eligible 2020 and can't hit free agency until 2023. In layman's terms, this means that whoever acquires Gallo will have him under team control for a considerable amount of years. Along with his team-friendly contract, Gallo has shown the ability to play left field (62 games), first base (32 games), right field (five games), and center field (1 game) this season. With all that being said, a trade for Gallo is not imminent at the moment, but the Rangers have reportedly not dismissed the idea. It should be interesting to see if the Phillies can grab themselves either an extra outfielder or reliever in the bullpen by Tuesday's 4:00 p.m. ET deadline.", "id": "65"}

{"content": "July 31--MightyVine, the Rochelle-based hydroponic grower of tomatoes, plans to double the size of its operation once again to help meet increasing demand from large retailers like Costco, Walmart and Jewel-Osco, according to company executives.Come September, construction will begin on two more 7.5-acre greenhouses in Rochelle, located about 80 miles west of Chicago, said MightyVine Chairman Jim Murphy. Once the $16 million project is complete, MightyVine will have four adjacent greenhouses totaling 30 acres that will produce about 105 million tomatoes a year, Murphy said. That represents the second major expansion for MightyVine since launching in 2015 to offer fresh, locally grown tomatoes year-round in the Chicago area.The agricultural startup has experienced some growing pains, too. In the summer's hottest weeks, the greenhouses can get too hot, making it difficult to maintain the same size and quality of fruit, Murphy said.Quantity has been the far greater challenge, though.\"We can't keep up with demand. ... It's hard to keep them in stores, so we have to build more,\" Murphy said.Much of the company's recent growth has come through large retailers like Costco, Walmart and Jewel. MightyVine is poised to sell through a second Walmart distribution center, which will expand its reach throughout the state, said MightyVine CEO Gary Lazarski. And after a trial run in 10 Costco stores, MightyVine plans to expand to more than 50 stores by the end of the year. In true supersized Costco fashion, MightyVine tomatoes come packaged in a 3-pound box for $6.49.Walmart and Costco did not respond to interview requests Monday.At Jewel, one of MightyVine's first retailers after Whole Foods Market, the tomatoes are typically available in all 187 stores -- when they're available, said Scott Bennett, produce sales manager for Jewel-Osco.Quality is never the problem with MightyVine, which leaves the tomatoes on the vine to ripen longer than most growers, Bennett said. After the tomatoes are harvested, they're transported to Jewel's distribution center in Melrose Park within a couple of hours, he said, and are in stores the next day.\"I've been doing produce for 35 years, and this is the best darn tomato I've ever had,\" Bennett said. \"They just don't have enough product. They have enough to keep everyone hooked. It's a great game they're playing -- we're all hooked.\"Lazarski acknowledged there's been tension with retailers as a result of supply shortages but said that ultimately, that's a good problem to have. MightyVine has grown from being a \"speculative venture\" to an established brand, Lazarski said.MightyVine is one of a handful of large-scale indoor commercial farms to enter the Chicago market in recent years. Others have also found a mix of successes and challenges. BrightFarms, a New York-based company that also has a hydroponic greenhouse in Rochelle, sells its leafy greens in Mariano's stores. Gotham Greens, another New York-based grower of leafy greens, announced earlier this year that it would build a second greenhouse in the Pullman area on Chicago's Far South Side.They're not all happy stories: FarmedHere, a pioneer of commercial hydroponic farming, closed its Bedford Park greenhouse last year, citing onerous costs and increased competition. Here Holdings, parent company of FarmedHere, instead shifted its focus to making food products -- such as juices, salad dressings and spreads -- under the Here brand at the company's food processing plant in Carol Stream in DuPage County.When MightyVine began selling tomatoes in 2016, it almost immediately found high-profile allies among some of Chicago's top chefs, including celebrity chef Rick Bayless who promoted the brand on social media. Today, MightyVine sells tomatoes to more than 200 restaurants in the Chicago area, including restaurants with the Lettuce Entertain You Enterprises and Four Corners restaurant groups.MightyVine is backed by Grow Forward, Murphy's investment and philanthropy firm. Local Foods, another of Murphy's ventures, is the wholesaler that distributes the MightyVine tomatoes to restaurants. The Grow Forward portfolio also includes Handcut Foods, a food service company for schools and universities, and Carbon Green BioEnergy, a Michigan-based ethanol company.Murphy, a longtime Chicago-area entrepreneur, called MightyVine his \"baby.\"\"Everyone in the business said we couldn't brand a tomato,\" Murphy said. \"We've captured the marketplace.\"gtrotter@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "67"}
{"content": "For Apple (AAPL) , is the iPhone still the center of the universe?  That's the question on the minds of many investors, with Apple falling slightly short in iPhone unit sales amid an overall robust June earnings report.  Apple beat expectations nearly across the board, reporting $53.3 billion in revenue, and a 20% increase in iPhone revenue for the quarter -- but analysts pressed Apple Tim Cook for more detail on Apple's plans for life beyond the iPhone, which makes up more than 60% of Apple's total revenue.  Shares rose almost 6% on Wednesday to a new all-time closing high of $201.50, leaving the the tech giant just shy of the historic trillion-dollar market cap.  On the company's earnings call with analysts on Tuesday afternoon, Needham analyst Laura Martin asked Tim Cook about him how the company thinks about its latest offerings such as the Apple Watch, AirPods and Apple Music subscriptions. \"I love the expansion of new products. Do they attract people to the ecosystem or does the person have to have an iPhone first?\" Martin asked. Driven in recent years by the iPhone, Apple's 'walled garden' ecosystem -- its closed world of devices, software, apps and content curated entirely by Apple -- has been very successful in enticing users and keeping them in the fold. But in a world populated by home assistants, wearables and other connected devices, in addition to phones, investors are debating how the users of the future will wind up there.  Cook responded on the call that non-iPhone devices and products are a \"core part of the ecosystem,\" as seen in increasing revenue in Apple's wearables business. Meanwhile, Apple is touting growth in its services category -- which includes the App Store, iTunes, iCloud and Apple Care -- which bullish analysts cite as evidence that Apple is on the right track. Apple reported that its service revenue increased 31% to $9.5 billion this quarter.  In an interview with TheStreet on Thursday, Martin explained how she interpreted Cook's response to her question. \"The answer led me to believe that even if you're drawn to the ecosystem through the Watch [or other products], you'll quickly integrate back into the phone, because the phone makes everything work,\" Martin said. Needham raised its price target to $220 from $210 on Wednesday largely on the idea that a more diversified slate of Apple products means more entry points into Apple's lucrative ecosystem. The firm estimates that Apple's ecosystem now includes 823 million unique users, with 90% of those users owning an iPhone and iOS users staying in the ecosystem for 10 years on average.  Still, some are looking to Apple's lagging performance in the red-hot home speaker category, currently dominated by Amazon (AMZN) Echo and Google (GOOGL) Home, as a potential red flag.  \"The gaping hole in their strategy right now is connected home; they need to get HomePod right or buy something else,\" said Tom Forte of DA Davidson. \"But what gives me encouragement there is that they poached someone from Google to improve Siri, and with a new iOS and the privacy features, they did make Siri incrementally better.\" Forte was referring to Apple hiring former Google AI chief John Giannandrea to lead its voice-assistant technology, following criticism of Siri's progress relative to Amazon's Alexa. Added Martin, \"there's a war going on between Microsoft (MSFT) , Amazon and Google in the home, while Apple is sort of dabbling. Their product roadmap has had TV on it; now it's had the HomePod for six months. We'll know how important it is to them by looking at their roadmap over the next two years.\" Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon are holdings in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS member club.

Come earnings on Aug. 1, that sliced bread may taste as good as 10-year old rye left outside in a hot shed. Among the 34 analysts on Wall Street that cover the money-losing Tesla, 10 rate the stock a buy despite the prospect for endless losses and cash burn. The rest are divided equally among sell and hold ratings (the latter in which is beyond wishy-washy given the volatility in Tesla's stock -- make a call, people).  The Tesla bulls could be characterized as hardcore upbeat. Price targets among the bulls range from $385 (James Albertine, Consumer Edge Research) to $530 (Pierre Ferragu, New Stree Research).  Tesla's shares closed Monday at $290, down 10% on the year.  Some of the bulls may want to take a look at the level-headed research from Goldman Sachs Tesla bear David Tamberrino.  \"We see Tesla potentially requiring over $10 billion in external capital raises and debt re-financing by 2020, given the company's current operations and plans for China and the Model Y,\" says Tamberinno, who has a $195 price target on Tesla. \"This capital raise could come in various forms and combinations, including convertible debt, bonds, and an equity raise.\" \"While our estimates remain below company target levels for Model 3 production, we model cash needs under a scenario where the company sustainably produces 10k/week Model 3 vehicles in 2020 -- and moves forward with the Model Y and plant capacity in China. Under this scenario, Tesla capital needs would be half of our estimate,\" Tamberrino said.  Read more on Tesla's future from TheStreet here ahead of the company's earnings.

All three are expected to have some impact on the Dolphins defense.Raekwon McMillan is showing up exactly like the Dolphins hoped he would, Bush said he \u201cis who we thought he was\u201d. McMillan has blossomed into a leader who used his time off last year to study film, watch tape, learn from the mistakes of others and through all that found a way to become a leader.His fellow teammates who were drafted last April, Jerome Baker and Quentin Poling are facing their first NFL training camp and while they both are having ups, they also have their share of downs as they learn the speed of the game.Bush says they will get more reps as practice moves along and as the pre-season begins citing that reps right now are not always available. It is likely that they both make an impact on special teams however.Following today\u2019s full-pad practice Bush talked about the younger guys as well Stephone Anthony who is now entering a full season with the Dolphins after they traded for him last season. The former first round pick did not look good last season after struggling with the New Orleans Saints. The team that drafted him.Bush believes that Anthony is getting better with the more reps he is taking and how he is improving now knowing the full system of the defense. Here is the full press release from the questions to Frank Bush courtesy of the (We\u2019ve seen LB Chase Allen out there a couple of times at outside linebacker and a couple of times with the starters. What are you liking about him and what enables him to play middle and outside linebacker?) \u2013 \u201cChase came in last year and proved to us that he\u2019s worthy of giving a look. He played some spot duty for us last year outside as well as inside. He\u2019s done a good job in the offseason of preparing himself. We just want to keep the competition going. We don\u2019t want anybody to get comfortable, so we\u2019re putting him back outside to make sure he and Steph (Anthony) have real competition out there; but meanwhile making sure that he\u2019s getting enough reps inside.\u201d(As far as LB Stephone Anthony, he\u2019s a guy that we haven\u2019t talked about a whole lot. How is his training camp going?) \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s going well. He came in later in our system last year, and we weren\u2019t able to use him fully like we expecting to. We used him in some third-down situations; but now, he\u2019s in there with the first group on first and second down. He\u2019s doing a good job for us and really kind of learning the system and owning the information. He\u2019s coming along. We just want to always keep our options open and make sure that we have the competition going.\u201d(What are your impressions on LB Jerome Baker so far?) \u2013 \u201c(He\u2019s a) really, really good athlete. He runs around really well. His brain has been good. He just has to learn how to be a pro and just keep it going every single day. He flashes a lot of good stuff, a lot of stuff to work with. He just has to mature as a player and keep it going.\u201d(Have there been mental mistakes with LB Jerome Baker?) \u2013 \u201cNo, not so much mental. A lot of it\u2019s physical. A lot of it\u2019s not understanding kind of how we do things and what we do. It\u2019s time on task. He needs more time on task and reps, and he\u2019ll get it. \u201d(I know we\u2019re not going to know this until preseason games, at least a full picture of LB Jerome Baker\u2019s ability against the run. Do you have a feel for it yet, how good he will be against the run?) \u2013 \u201cI know he will trigger when we ask him to trigger. So far, so good. We just have to go live with bullets. A couple of these practices have done wonders for him, but we have to go live with it. He has to be consistent.\u201d(One thing we know on LB Raekwon McMillan, obviously: poised, polished, he prepares. As far as on-field skills, what have you seen in this camp after not seeing him after early August last year?) \u2013 \u201cHe is who we thought he was. He\u2019s doing all of the things we suspected. His legs have come around, his brain has always been good. He\u2019s just consistently getting better. Obviously he didn\u2019t get a lot of reps last year. He transitioned to the first group later on in the preseason last year, and we were looking forward to seeing him in that first preseason game. It didn\u2019t work out that way; but so far, so good. He has growing pains. He\u2019s a redshirt rookie out here, so he has growing pains; but ultimately, we like what we see.\u201d(When that happens \u2013 like you said, it\u2019s like taking a redshirt year in college \u2013 how much can that benefit? When you look at the silver lining, how much can that benefit a player?) \u2013 \u201cIt teaches you how to be a pro. You know how to go about your routine, you know what you have to do to get yourself better as far as physically and whatnot. He stayed around and learned the system. He really got into the playbook. He studied all of the games, all of the cutups, all of those things. That part of it allowed him to kind of learn the system from a relaxed standpoint, so that really helped him that way.\u201d(When that happens, can you really tell a difference in the second year on the field, how well it translates?) \u2013 \u201cAbsolutely. Some of the things he was doing last year and making mistakes on, this year he\u2019s not making as many mistakes. So, yes, I think that helped him a lot.\u201d(LB Quentin Poling, you\u2019ve seen him make some plays. What are your thoughts on him?) \u2013 \u201c(He\u2019s a) young kid, a very sharp kid. He does a lot of good things. He\u2019s just like every other rookie, he\u2019s operating at about 60 or 70 percent right now. That 30 or 40 percent is still new to him. He\u2019s doing a good job for us. We like his energy. The kid\u2019s got a great attitude. He\u2019s proven so far that he does not mind the physical part of the game. Again, unfortunately he\u2019s not going to get as many quality reps as some guys; but he will get his opportunity as camp goes on, and we expect him to keep getting better. \u201d(We\u2019ve seen some good plays in pass coverage from LB Quentin Poling. Is that something that you weren\u2019t sure what you had or did you expect that?) \u2013 \u201cWe expected that because we thought the athlete was capable of doing those things. Now it\u2019s about positioning. Can he put himself in the position to do it and understand the speed of the game? That\u2019s part of when a kid comes from a school like that, a system like that, that sometimes the speed of the game is a little bit too much for him. But he\u2019s proven that over time, he\u2019s speeding his game up and it\u2019s not too much for him.\u201d", "id": "70"}

{"content": "July 26--President Trump has lashed out on Twitter. Now he is lashing out at Twitter.In a tweet Thursday morning, Trump attacked his social network of choice: \"Twitter 'SHADOW BANNING' prominent Republicans. Not good. We will look into this discriminatory and illegal practice at once! Many complaints.\"\"Shadow banning\" refers to a practice that predates the birth of Twitter: hiding or downgrading a user's posts instead of banning the user, so that most people in an online forum cannot see the posts.The president was likely referring to a report by Vice News, which said Wednesday it found that some Republican lawmakers, the Republican National Committee chair and Donald Trump Jr.'s spokesman no longer appeared in Twitter's auto-populated drop-down search box.When reached Thursday, a Twitter spokesman said he would have no comment about the president's tweet. But he did address the shadow-banning charges: \"As we have said before, we do not 'shadowban.' We are aware that some accounts are not automatically populating in our search box, and shipping a change to address this. The profiles, Tweets and discussions about these accounts do appear when you search for them.\"Kayvon Beykpour, Twitter's head of product, tweeted Wednesday that the disappearance of some of the Republicans from the drop-down menu in search was a side effect of the company's push to improve discourse on Twitter by cracking down on trolls, an effort it outlined in May. It involves taking into account user accounts' behavioral signals, including how they interact with other Twitter users.\"To be clear, our behavioral ranking doesn't make judgements based on political views or the substance of tweets,\" he said. \"We're always working to improve our behavior-based ranking models -- their breadth and accuracy will improve over time.\"A check Thursday morning confirmed that the names mentioned in the Vice article are once again appearing automatically in Twitter's search box, including that of RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel, Rep. Devin Nunes, R-California, Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Florida, plus Trump Jr.'s spokesman, Andrew Surabian.So that's that, right? No, because it's 2018. The president's tweet, plus other Republican outrage over the report, is just the latest complaint in what has become conservatives' refrain: that Silicon Valley's tech giants are biased against them -- despite the fact that it has become increasingly clear that disinformation on the very platforms they complain about were a factor in Trump and the Republicans' victories at the polls in 2016.Gaetz, the Republican congressman, told the Hill he felt \"victimized\" by Twitter.During two separate Congressional hearings in April about Facebook's latest privacy scandal, which involved Cambridge Analytica -- a data consulting firm founded by conservatives that was used to help conservatives during the 2016 election -- several conservative lawmakers asked Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg about what they perceived to be anti-conservative bias on the social network.Also, representatives from Twitter, Facebook and YouTube were summoned to appear at a hearing last week before the House Judiciary Committee on Capitol Hill. They had to explain their content-filtering policies, and denied again that they are biased against conservatives.At that hearing, Nick Pickles, Twitter's global lead for public policy strategy, testified, \"Our success as a company depends on making Twitter a safe place for free expression and a place that serves healthy public conversation.\"The tech giants have sometimes had wildly divergent approaches to content filtering.For example, in a discussion about fake news on its platform, Facebook recently defended conspiracy theory-laden InfoWars' right to free speech.On the other hand, YouTube this week reportedly deleted four videos from the channel of Alex Jones -- who runs the InfoWars website and is perhaps most famous for popularizing the conspiracy theory that the 2012 mass school shooting at Sandy Hook was a hoax -- and issued a \"strike\" against him. The Verge reports that two of the videos contained hate speech against Muslims, one contained hate speech against transgender people, and one -- titled \"How to prevent liberalism\" -- showed a child being pushed to the ground by an adult.\"We have longstanding policies against child endangerment and hate speech,\" a YouTube spokesperson said Thursday. \"We apply our policies consistently according to the content in the videos, regardless of the speaker or the channel. We also have a clear three strikes policy and we terminate channels when they receive three strikes in three months.\"Also last week, Zuckerberg got flak for saying Facebook is OK with hosting Holocaust deniers on its platform.___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "72"}

But are the Thunder done with their moves?As free agency slows and pre-season nears, the OKC Thunder appear to be done making moves. With 15 players signed to contracts, Oklahoma City have no roster spots to simply acquire players off the market. The Thunder need to either waive, stretch or trade for players to alter its current roster.It goes without saying that OKC have concentrated on acquiring as many wings as possible, electing to occupy eight of the 15 spots with shooting guards and small forwards. However, this has caused an imbalance in the roster. With Patrick Patterson the only legitimate power forward, the Thunder are lacking front court depth. It would be wise for Oklahoma City to acquire another power forward should injuries arise.The Thunder have three trade chips in Terrance Ferguson, Alex Abrines and Kyle Singler. TFerg is only 20 years-old and has tremendous upside as a three and D player. Presti never trades young assets on controllable contracts therefore its difficult to imagine trading him unless its a player that definitively raises OKC\u2019s ceiling.Abrines and Singler on the other hand are expiring contracts and can be moved easily due to their small cap hit. The Spaniard is Oklahoma City\u2019s purest shooter while Singler is nothing more than a locker room voice making close to $5 million. OKC also have their second round picks from 2020 on-wards.The Thunder need to find a player(s) that can:Shoot the ball from rangeCan play power forward and capable of playing on the breakPerforming a trade that doesn\u2019t increase the luxury taxLets take a look three trade possibilities.", "id": "75"}

She was brought in on money laundering charges and of course, Piper\u2019s character in the series is played by Taylor Schilling.Kerman went on to write a memoir about her experiences in prison, and while the show may not be following her life anymore, in the seventh episode of this season, Piper starts talking about writing a memoir!It\u2019s pretty exciting to see this Easter egg emerge in the episode because the show is based on the memoir after all! Wonder what Kerman has to say about where Piper is at now in the series? The motivation to write a memoir comes from boredom as well as trying to prove to herself that she still has more to accomplish in life. She wants to single-handedly solve all the issues within Litchfield, and then document them in the book.This episode also took us back in time to Badison\u2019s past\u2013and boy, was she a feisty one. She had anger management issues which were amplified due to being bullied. It\u2019s clear from her flashback that she suffers from her insecurities and pushes them down with her relentless attitude. I\u2019m not sure that I care much about the new characters\u2019 flashbacks, because they just aren\u2019t providing any new information.Let\u2019s not forget about Ruiz and her near-death experience in the bathroom. She is placed in Psych because they are convinced she tried taking her own life\u2013but things seem a bit fishy here. Let\u2019s see how this plays out in the episodes to come.Cindy continues to struggle with the guilt over ratting Taystee out, but it also means she could lose her plea deal. The biggest challenge she has is making sure Suzanne doesn\u2019t spill the beans, but when Taystee asks to send Suzanne a note, Cindy is feeling the heat.Rec time gets a little out of hand in this episode of Orange Is The New Black when Badison is cut with a knife (the withdrawals within D Block are very real), but as she goes down, she hands off the contraband cell phone to Alex. I really need Alex to stay out of this mess and not get extra time added on, thanks.I am getting so frustrated with Daya this season, and this episode has her really experiencing withdrawal symptoms, and the desire to get a fix is desperate. So much so that she digs through Barb\u2019s trash, and then comes on to Daddy. Daya is a hot mess and shows no signs of slowing down. I wonder what Aleida will have to say about this?In the world of Caputo and Fig, as he prepares to head out to Missouri, he and Fig go on an actual date inclusive of some karaoke. As horrible as she is, it\u2019s sort of sweet to see them have a moment this episode. How long it will last is up to Fig\u2019s next mood swing.Pennsatucky was finally moved from Ad Seg into Florida, which is a bit crazy considering she was just on the run. But she sees Linda in the prison and blackmails her with everything she knew about her from the riot (remember Big Boo?) to secure a spot in the best block.Orange Is The New Black is keeping us on our toes, and it seems like Piper will be too with her memoir and the discovery of a photo box with photos of inmates playing kickball.", "id": "76"}

{"content": "We\u2019ve only been to the Moon a handful of times. But we\u2019ve already set our sights on a far more ambitious mission: colonize Mars.If you believe the hype, it may happen in just a few decades. Elon Musk anticipates that SpaceX\u2019s BFR (big f\u2013king rocket) will take its first handful of passengers to the Red Planet by 2024 \u2014 if everything goes according to plan, that is. Mars One\u2019s crew, which will take up permanent residence on Mars, is slated to launch by 2031. NASA is aiming for a similar mission by 2033.Getting humans there is hard enough. But surviving there, especially over a prolonged period? That\u2019s a whole other question. A structure on Mars would have to withstand intense solar radiation and massive daily temperature changes, and provide a pressurized environment inside for humans to inhabit over a prolonged period of time. Weight and space limits aboard the rockets that will get us there will make the design task even harder.3D printing the habitat seems like humanity\u2019s best bet. The Martian surface comes with its own challenges, but back on Earth, 3D printing technology in home construction is proving to be very promising. A 3D printer with local resources from the surface as the \u201cink\u201d would mean that astronauts wouldn\u2019t have to fill up precious cargo space with building materials. Plus, the reduced weight would make Mars colonization substantially less expensive.So NASA held a contest for the best 3D-printed habitat that might actually work on Mars. That was in 2014. The first two phases of the project required teams to submit renderings, and come up with material technologies. Now, four years after launching the contest, NASA has narrowed the finalists to just five brilliant designs. The fives teams, which hail from a handful of American universities and companies that specialize in architecture or construction, have now come up with an entire structure that takes advantage of autonomous 3D printing on the surface of another planet; they will also share a $100,000 prize. For the next phase, each team will have to create a third-scale model of their designs.Here are what the five finalists propose:First Place: Team ZopherusTeam Zopherus from Rogers, Arkansas came up with the idea of mixing \u201cMartian concrete\u201d using locally available materials \u2014 ice, calcium oxide, and Martian rocks.A huge metal dome houses the concrete mixer and 3D printer. The dome protects the structure the printer is constructing from the harsh environment. Once the printer is done with a section, it lifts itself up, and repeats the process elsewhere. The resulting habitats are hexagonal, made of finished concrete that the team claims would be able to withstand the harsh local climate and absorb enough radiation to protect humans living within. The metal dome that houses the printer, plus any air locks and windows for the final construction will have to be shipped separately from Earth.Second Place: Team AI SpaceFactoryThe team from New York tried to inject an \u201celement of humanity\u201d into its habitat design to create a \u201ccredible and evocative habitat with an alien yet familiar beauty\u201d according to the team\u2019s website. The habitat, dubbed Marsha, is cylindrical to maximize usable floor area and pressurization efficiency. Multiple floors also means inhabitants won\u2019t end up murdering each other (that\u2019s a real concern), offering each activity or group of people their own closed off space.Sliding bearings on the floor allow the walls of the habitat to \u201cbreathe\u201d as it expands and contracts as the outside temperature changes.There are two layers: an outer shell to keep the harsh environment out, and an inner shell that houses people. The outer shell is made out of a reusable thermoplastic that is mixed with local rock fibers to reinforce it. This type of plastic, called PLA, is great for this application because it doesn\u2019t expand or contract as much as other plastics when temperatures drop or spike.Team Kahn-YatesThe team from Jackson, Mississippi designed a habitat that has a prefabricated core, which the lander plops down on the Martian surface. Once it lands, the core extends a giant print arm that 3D prints the oval habitat\u2019s foundation, then its walls.The habitat\u2019s exterior shell has carefully-designed openings that allow sunlight to reach the inside. A gap between the outer shell and the interior core provide space for lush garden that can help filter the air inside.Team SEArch+Apis CorThe team from New York balanced on the habitat\u2019s ability to shield inhabitants from radiation while still allowing sunlight to filter into the design\u2019s interior. The team partnered up with Apis Cor, an (Earth-bound) construction company that has already 3D-printed entire buildings using a special type of concrete.In this model, the inhabitants live inside a pair of \u201cinflatable volumes\u201d that can be deployed to the Martian surface before the crew arrives. A 3D printed shell, made of rough loose rocks, would shield the inflatable habitats from radiation.Team Northwestern UniversityLike previous team, Northwestern\u2019s team designed an inflatable pressurized vessel that houses the 3D printer. The outer shell would be printed out of resources available on the crust nearby.The layout focuses all \u201cwet rooms\u201d (kitchen, bathroom, and lab) along one side of the habitat to concentrate plumbing and other mechanical features to one area. NASA\u2019s HI-SEAS experiment, which simulated space exploration, informed the proportions of the different rooms.", "id": "78"}
{"content": "July 27--The non-waiver trade deadline is 3 p.m. Tuesday, and President Theo Epstein said he believes the Cubs will make a deal. Here are some questions and answers regarding the team's needs and trading landscape.How did the Cubs get to this point with their pitching needs?The starters haven't pitched deep into games with any regularity, causing stress on a bullpen that has been effective and resilient despite injuries to valuable late-inning specialists Brandon Morrow and Carl Edwards Jr.Yu Darvish's injury has further stretched the depth. Left-handed reliever Mike Montgomery had to be plugged into the rotation, which left the bullpen without an experienced long reliever. A season-ending injury to top pitching prospect Adbert Alzolay looms even larger, especially because he could have performed the long-relief duties and made an occasional spot start.The Cubs are in a stretch of playing 12 games in 11 days and will brace themselves for 23 consecutive games without a scheduled day off starting Aug. 21.Which teams are potential trade partners?The most likely matches are the Orioles, Blue Jays, Royals, Marlins and Padres. Two pitchers who seemed to fit the Cubs' profile -- Orioles left-handed closer Zach Britton and Rays starter Nathan Eovaldi -- were traded this week to the Yankees and Red Sox.Orioles relievers Mychal Givens (0-6, 4.62 ERA, 1.401 WHIP) and Brad Brach (1-2, 11 saves, 4.85 ERA, 1.769 WHIP) aren't having overwhelming seasons but could help the Cubs bullpen. Marlins left-hander Adam Conley (3-1, 2.63 ERA, 0.915 WHIP) is enjoying a career-best season and possesses better control than teammate Kyle Barraclough (0-4, 2.45 ERA, 1.068 WHIP), who has struck out 50 but walked 24 in 44 innings. Both players are arbitration-eligible this winter, so the price tag could be steep.The Padres' Tyson Ross (6-8, 4.29 ERA, 1.288 WHIP), whom the Cubs courted before the 2017 season while he was recovering from a shoulder injury, has made 20 starts. Dodgers radio announcer Kevin Kennedy observed during a July 12 start that Ross' mechanics weren't smooth, but Ross managed to no-hit the Dodgers for 5 1/3 innings.A few years ago, general manager Jed Hoyer quipped that the Cubs someday would make a deal with the Mets. But any potential trade is unlikely to involve Jacob deGrom because of the projected asking price and lack of prospects needed to satisfy the Mets.Epstein said Sunday an impact trade would be difficult, but the pool of potential trade partners could expand as more teams fade from playoff contention.Who might be dealt from the Cubs farm system?The Cubs are reluctant to move anyone from the current major-league roster. Also, trading Gleyber Torres, Eloy Jimenez and Dylan Cease has sapped the organization of some of its top prospects.A few scouts have inquired about David Bote, whose stock has ascended and who would be on the major-league roster full time if a spot was available for him. One scout asked, \"I like him, but where do you play him?\" My answer: \"In the batter's box.\" Bote has displayed adequate versatility around the infield, but he might be too valuable to the Cubs as an insurance policy as manager Joe Maddon monitors Ben Zobrist's playing time and Kris Bryant's lingering shoulder problems.I don't see many untouchables, although 19-year-old catcher Miguel Amaya has impressed this season with a .799 OPS, 12 homers and 44 RBIs in 86 games for Class A South Bend. The Cubs also invested heavily in 2017 first-round picks Brendon Little and Alex Lange as they try to bolster their pitching depth, which has suffered a hit because of the injury to Alzolay, Oscar De La Cruz's suspension and Jose Albertos' struggles.Why didn't the Cubs make a push for Manny Machado?Machado would have been a luxury, not a need. The Cubs don't possess the depth of prospects the Dodgers surrendered to acquire Machado, who is a free agent after this season.Why is it difficult to make deals after July 31?Teams with a worse record than the Cubs can put in a waiver claim to block them from acquiring the player. There's also the fear of putting in a claim on a player with an expensive contract and being stuck with that contract if the team with that player's rights simply awards the player and balance of his contract to the claiming team.The Cubs put in a claim on Chase Utley a few years ago, but Utley had the right to choose his team and selected the Dodgers in part because of their proximity to his West Coast roots.What post-July 31 targets could the Cubs address?Possibly another versatile defender or a baserunning specialist. They added speedster Quintin Berry in late August 2015 after the Red Sox released him, and they traded for outfielder Leonys Martin from the Mariners on Aug. 31, 2017.mgonzales@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "79"}

{"content": "Aug. 02--August has arrived, yet there's still no end in sight for major-league teams, especially one like the White Sox.It's a young mix, and players know the only race they'll have is the one to avoid setting a franchise record for losses. But it's an important time for development and evaluation, which is why Dylan Covey was so disappointed after allowing seven runs in 41/3 innings on Wednesday night, why Yoan Moncada was bummed to follow his 14th homer with his 16th error.The 10-5 loss to the Royals was the 107th game for the Sox, which means they have 55 left. They're on pace to go 56-106, matching their 162-game low-water mark from 1970, and they'll play 13 of their next 30 games against the Yankees, Red Sox and Indians.Yikes.Covey said the problem against the Royals was his lack of command, not the time of the year.\"I feel like at this level it's tough all throughout the year,\" said the right-hander, who is 4-7 with a 5.57 ERA. \"I feel good physically. I feel strong mentally. I've just had an up and down last few outings.\"\"You're getting to a point in the season where you've been driving and working, doing everything you can to put yourself in a good position,\" manager Rick Renteria said. \"As a club, (you're) always pushing to try to contend. We're not in that situation. We're in a 'continuing-to-develop' mode. These guys now are seeing a little bit of what it is to still have two months of the regular season (left).\"Twelve White Sox players have yet to spend a full season in the major leagues. They are in uncharted territory, gaining experience that should help them when top prospects and free-agent additions arrive and rebuilding ideally turns into contending.\"Hopefully in the near future they're not looking to just finish at the end of September but continue to push,\" Renteria said. \"They've got to find ways to put themselves in a position to continue to finish. I think they're learning about that.\"Tim Anderson was back in the lineup after being yanked in the sixth inning Tuesday when he didn't leave the batter's box on a ball that turned into a bizarre fielder's choice (third base to second base to first base for one out). He made a great play to start the game, ranging far to his right and firing a long, accurate throw to retire the Royals' Whit Merrifield -- but that was one of very few Sox highlights.Yoan Moncada's leadoff home run provided some false hope. The story of the game was the 10 runs the Royals put on the board between the third and sixth innings, making fans wonder if Renteria would bring in Matt Davidson for another save-the-bullpen appearance.There are going to be a lot more of these nights between now and 2020 or 2021 -- whenever the White Sox become a threat to the American League's better teams -- so Renteria will monitor the team's approach as much as anything. He sent a message when he benched Anderson on Tuesday but remains pleased that his players do a good job of pushing themselves and each other.He said he'll make a concession to the time of the season by backing off on some drills and side work but expects players to seek more work, not less.\"A lot of these guys are still pushing,\" Renteria said. \"They're still wanting to come out to do some extra stuff. So we'll do what we need to do to accommodate them but also let them know they still need to get their rest and make sure they can finish the season.\"Phil Rogers is a freelance reporter for the Chicago Tribune___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "81"}
{"content": "Aug. 02--OAKLAND -- It's the same rotation that has helped the A's to a 64-46 record, virtually tied with the Seattle Mariners for the second American League wild-card spot heading into Thursday. But it's also the same rotation that ranks 22nd in the majors with a 4.34 ERA. Perhaps more concerning is that Sean Manaea is really the only starter who can be counted on to go somewhat deep into a game. The last time a starter other than Manaea completed seven innings was June 9 when Chris Bassitt did it against the Kansas City Royals.The A's have been able to overcome a rotation that has seen 12 pitchers make a start with great hitting and a lights-out bullpen, but it's clear that the starters will need to pick it up. So of course, most of the questions in this mailbag were focused on that glaring weakness.@MoneyballWorks: Do you expect that we'll target a starting pitcher in August or just call up Mengden/Naile/internal guys?Martin Gallegos: I fully expect David Forst and Billy Beane to be keeping a close eye on the waiver wire for all pitchers, and even position players, looking to add a spark in these final two months. Matt Harvey is the \"big name\" pitcher expected to be moved in August, though I already have heard the front office is not a fan of bringing in the former Mets ace. Sonny Gray might also get moved, but I don't believe the A's want to go down that road again either, at least not this year.Two starters who I think could be had are Twins pitcher Ervin Santana, a 2017 All-Star who is just returning from injury, and White Sox pitcher James Shields. Neither represent a huge boost, ala Justin Verlander with Houston last year, but both can give you innings, which the A's will need down the stretch with a bullpen that is already overworked.The likely scenario? The A's stick with what they have in the rotation, with Daniel Mengden and Bassitt available in the minors as reinforcement.@JohnKnepper: If the season ended today and we made the wild-card playoff against the Yankees. Is Sean Manaea the starter or someone else on the rotation who has postseason experience?Gallegos: This is a tricky one. If Manaea is available, he would be a lock to start that game. But there's a chance Manaea is pitching in those few days before that game in order to help the A's clinch that wild-card spot. If Manaea can't go, I think 2011 World Series winner Edwin Jackson is the best bet. Trevor Cahill also is an option, but his poor numbers on the road would be a concern.@JimmerDMC: Currently, Jed (Lowrie) and Marcus (Semien) have the middle infield locked up. If I remember correctly, (Franklin) Barreto experimented with center field in Triple A for a bit. Any thoughts on potentially using him there in the majors this season? He looks to have the potential of a really solid hitter.Gallegos: The A's briefly revisited this in April when the team was in Los Angeles for a two-game series against the Dodgers. Barreto was working in the outfield pregame both days, but nothing ever came of it. Perhaps the club could again try him there in the spring, but I don't see him getting any playing time there in the majors this season.@Bubbatyuos45 Has (Nick) Martini taken over (Matt) Joyce's spot for good?Gallegos: Martini is looking like the best leadoff hitter the A's have had all season for his ability to get on base and tremendous bat control, though it is a small sample size. He's probably going to continue as the starter until he falters, and who knows if Joyce will recover from his back issues any time soon. If Joyce is healthy, I think his veteran presence has a spot on this team.@realtorbb: Any truth to the rumor that the A's Triple-A team is moving back west to replace the team that is leaving Las Vegas? Makes a lot of sense to have a PCL team out West and closer to Oakland.Gallegos: Not the first time I have heard this. The A's four-year player development contract with Nashville is done after this season, and I would think the club would love to find an affiliate closer to home. Whether it's Vegas or somewhere else, I think the A's Triple-A club leaves Nashville.@Thisisjinwoo: What will the pitching staff look like for the stretch run in September? What options are likely for the A's for trades with waiver trades?Gallegos: Sean Manaea, Edwin Jackson, Trevor Cahill, Brett Anderson and Frankie Montas are the current starting five. Other than Daniel Mengden overtaking Anderson's spot, I don't see much changing for September. Forst pretty much shot down the idea of calling up super prospect Jesus Luzardo, and the only options I see as far as trades are the names I mentioned a few questions ago.___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "82"}

{"content": "July 27--Before the electroshock-therapy finish of Thursday's 7-6 walk-off triumph over the Diamondbacks, there was little for the Cubs to like about the day's developments.It began with Kris Bryant going on the disabled list again and Tyler Chatwood staging another walkathon, adding six more walks to his major-league-leading total in only 4 2/3 innings.But by the end of the afternoon David Bote's game-tying home run in the ninth made Bryant's absence a little less worrisome, while Chatwood's control problems were put on the back burner with the deal that brought veteran left-hander Cole Hamels to the Cubs for two prospects.While the Rangers' Hamels isn't the same pitcher who no-hit the Cubs nearly three years ago to the day at Wrigley Field, he could become rejuvenated if inserted into a pennant race.Or at least that's the idea.In reality, it's going to take a major turnaround for Hamels, 34, to get back to being the dominant pitcher he was in his prime with the Phillies. Hamels already had served up 23 home runs as of Thursday, tied for the second-worst total in the majors, with a 4.72 ERA. And over his last four starts he's 1-3 with an 11.12 ERA, so he's not exactly trending upward.But Hamels also has a 2.93 ERA on the road, compared with 6.41 ERA at home, so perhaps the Cubs can count on a better performance now that he has escaped Texas. Of course, they also counted on Chatwood pitching better after leaving Coors Field, and that hasn't worked out so well.Assuming Hamels can find his mojo by returning to the National League, he at least would be an upgrade over Chatwood, who doesn't look as if he's ready for prime time even as the Cubs keep giving him chance after chance to figure things out.Still, they keep on winning, seemingly immune from his walk-heavy outings. One thing we know about these Cubs is we don't know anything. Who would have thought they would have the best record in the NL at the end of July with almost no help at all from Yu Darvish or Chatwood?\"I think the best is yet to come for our starting rotation,\" said Anthony Rizzo, whose walk-off homer ended the game. \"Even Jonny (Lester), I think, (though) I don't know how, can start throwing better. ... When you get to the playoffs, it's a bounce here, a bounce there. Anything can happen.\"But I like our guys. I like our chances every single time our starting pitcher takes the mound.\"Manager Joe Maddon played with the media by lauding Hamels during his postgame briefing, after being informed that President Theo Epstein was seen smiling while walking into the clubhouse.\"Did he just have a good Italian beef sandwich?\" Maddon said before making an R-rated aside.It was a fitting analogy. Hamels is more like a good Italian beef sandwich at this point of his career after being prime-grade steak throughout most of it.But as the soundtrack from \"A Night at the Roxbury\" blared from the nearby clubhouse, Rizzo sat at the podium in the interview room and said with a straight face the players weren't paying much attention to the Hamels rumor.\"You see it, you hear about it, but supposedly we were getting Manny Machado (on) April 2,\" he said. \"I don't think that worked out for us. That's the nonsense that happens, so until it's a done deal ...\"Everyone knows it's too much. 'Oh, we're getting Cole Hamels now' because someone said we're talking to the Rangers. (When) it happens, it happens, and that's just the way it is.\"A couple of hours later it happened. Now we will see how much Hamels has left in the tank.This has the feel of the Cubs' 2015 deadline deal for Dan Haren, who was acquired from the Marlins for a couple of minor prospects who never panned out.Haren was 34 and on his last legs but was good enough to insert at the back end of the rotation. He wound up making 11 starts for the Cubs, going 4-2 with a 4.01 ERA. He wasn't used in the postseason and retired after the season.Hamels would seem to be a good fit in the clubhouse and, of course, he has postseason experience. He's probably the best available option left in a trade market that lacks quality. And the Cubs didn't have to give up a valuable piece, making it a decent risk.They now will have to make a tough decision. Do they send Chatwood to the bullpen, a demotion he has earned? Demote Mike Montgomery to his old relief spot -- which he doesn't deserve -- to beef up the pen? Go with a six-man rotation and put Lester off his routine?Hamels could be a godsend to a rotation that hasn't lived up to expectations. Or he could be a bad gamble if he remains inconsistent down the stretch. Epstein has earned the benefit of the doubt after building a championship team in five years, and maybe this move is the perfect audible to get the Cubs back to the World Series.Either way, the season just got more interesting.psullivan@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "84"}
{"content": "July 28--The Blackhawks have had so much success over the last decade fans have enormous expectations, even for a team coming off a last-place finish.Patrick Kane is OK with that.\"Look at a team like Colorado,\" Kane said. \"Finished in last place and then last year they're one of the hottest teams in the league, they make the playoffs and have a great season.

( Netflix | YouTube )As fans already know by now, Netflix won't be releasing the third season of Stranger Things this year, but the wait won't be for naught \u2014 Netflix's VP of original content Cindy Holland said the upcoming installment will be bigger and better than last year's season.Asked why there's a delay, Holland explained that it's a handcrafted show. Indeed, creating something special for fans and not just a shameless cash-grab will take a bit of time. Just ask Game of Thrones.Stranger Things Season 3 Will Be Worth The Wait\"You know, the Duffer brothers and Shawn Levy have worked really hard and they understand the stakes are high,\" Holland said, as reported by The Wrap. \"They want to deliver something bigger and better than what they did last year. And so, they really want to take the time to get it right. I think it's gonna be a fantastic season, it's gonna be worth the wait.\"A lot fans were expecting the third season of Stranger Things to be released this fall on Halloween since that would be the perfect release window for the show and would have coincided with Netflix's annual release pattern for existing original shows. It's uncommon for a successful show not to have a new season per year \u2014 save for Master of None, nearly every Netflix original has seen yearly renewals.Stranger ThingsStranger Things is one of the streaming service's most beloved franchises, becoming a breakout hit when it premiered in 2016. It's been lauded for its excellent portrayal of child friendships, experimentation with a slew of different genres, and fantastic use of references from the '80s. It's also been nominated for a bunch of Emmy Awards.For this year's ceremony, it's up for a few: Outstanding Drama Series; Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for David Harbour, who plays Jim Hopper; Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series for Millie Bobby Brown, who plays Eleven; and two more nominations for The Duffer Brothers in the Directing and Writing categories.Stranger Things Season 3 Release DateNetflix has strongly implied that the next season will premiere sometime during summer next year, as indicated by a recently released teaser video featuring a fake commercial for the Starcourt Mall. The promo said the shopping center is \"coming next summer.\"Are you bummed about the delay? What's your favorite thing about the whole Stranger Things franchise?

{"content": "The bull is alive, for now. According to Citigroup Inc. (C) analysts, it's \"too early to call the end of this nine year global bull market.\" Here's what you need to do to make the most of what's left. Reallocate Between Sectors Though it is almost impossible to predict when the market will reach its top, certified financial planner William Brancaccio of Rightirement Wealth Partners recommends that investors who think a correction isn't far off pull their money from vulnerable sectors. \"If we are approaching a market top and you want to be protective you would want to overweight defensive sectors,\" Brancaccio said. \"Healthcare, Utilities and Consumer Staples would be a good starting point. Energy and Materials also tend to hold up during a market decline as well.\" Prepare for the Inevitable Correction The best thing you can do for your portfolio during the finale of a bull market is make sure it can endure the oncoming bear market, certified financial planner George Gagliardi of Coromandel Wealth Management said. While Gagliardi believes that a bear market might be a while off due to rising interest rates, he recommends that investors take precautions as a correction could come as soon as next month. \"Why be one of the hundreds of theatre patrons rushing to the one exit door when someone shouts 'Fire!'?\" Gagliardi said. \"Why not go stand next to the door to be the first one out, or better yet, leave early. This market may have a little upside left in it, but it definitely has a lot of downside, and anyone who thinks that they are fast enough to get out of the market quickly when things really head south is fooling themselves.\"  Gagliardi recommends adding lower risk investments such as short term Treasury bonds to your portfolio to ensure that the market correction doesn't erase the gains you make over the last nine years. Get Ready for Buying Opportunities As you reduce your exposure to equities, certified financial planner Ruth Delaney advises investors to prepare themselves to buy. \"The end of a bull market is not the end of the world and may present some buying opportunities for younger, more risk tolerant investors,\" Delaney said. Older investors who don't have enough time before retirement to wait out a market cycle might want to stick with lower risk investments however, Delaney said. \"Depending on your stage in life, it is always wise to re-evaluate your risk tolerance and your capacity for taking risk,\" Delaney said. \"If you are very near retirement, then it may be time to reallocate your portfolio to lessen the impact of a bear market.\" Facebook is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS member club.

{"content": "Aug. 03--What happens when a parent tells a kid not to swear, but then uses cuss words as though they were commas?The child will swear.The same thing happens when a parent tells a teen not to speed, or text and drive, but regularly does it when the teen is in the car, according to safe driving experts.A new national study found that 37 percent of parents of teen drivers use apps while driving, which is almost at the same rate of teens at 38 percent. The study by Boston-based Liberty Mutual Insurance also found that parents admit to speeding, driving while tired and even taking selfies behind the wheel at similar or higher rates than teenagers.\"Parents are role models for their teen drivers and when the parent is the 'rule breaker' they are setting a bad example,\" said Dr. Gene Beresin, a senior educator in child and adolescent psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital and a Liberty Mutual consultant, in a statement. \"I encourage parents and teens to set and agree upon boundaries together to help keep everyone safe on the road.\"The risk of motor vehicle crashes is higher among teenage drivers than among drivers of other ages, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. Crashes are the leading cause of death for teens in the United States, killing eight teenagers daily, the safety board said. An International Transport Forum study found that the United States is leading the world in increased traffic deaths, and distracted driving is the primary cause.The Liberty Mutual study found that while parents are asking their teens not to text and drive, parents are texting them and expecting a response. The main reasons teens use their phones while behind the wheel are to respond to (47 percent) or contact their parents (44 percent), the study said.The study also found that 37 percent of parents admit to not enforcing punishments when their child breaks a driving rule, or even the law. Of this group, 38 percent said they do not enforce rules because it is not convenient.Almost half of teens surveyed (46 percent) and 41 percent of parents who use their phones while driving consider red lights and stop signs to be socially acceptable places to use them. But this can lead to danger, said Mike Sample, a safe driving expert and technical consultant at Liberty Mutual.\"It doesn't matter if you're an experienced parent driver or a new teen driver, you should always pull over and put your car in park before using your phone to avoid putting yourself and others at a greater risk of an accident or near miss,\" Sample said in a statement.The survey of 2,000 teens and 1,000 parents of licensed teen drivers uncovered some contradictory results. For example, the survey found that while 20 percent of parents admitted to texting and driving, 30 percent of teens said their parents texted and drove, which indicates that some parents may be exaggerating their good behavior.More than a third of teens said their parents claimed more experience as a justification for bad driving habits, the study found.Parents surveyed admitted to bad driving behavior at higher or similar rates compared to teens, including speeding (37 percent for parents and 27 percent for teens); driving while drowsy (26 percent and 22 percent, respectively); and taking selfies (14 percent and 15 percent).mwisniewski@chicagotribune.comMORE TRANSPORTATION NEWS FROM MARY WISNIEWSKI___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "89"}
{"content": "(Kitco News) - Like its neighbor Yukon, Alaska is on the verge of a mining and exploration boom, this according to Frazer Tabeart, managing director of PolarX Ltd (ASX: PXX). The prospect of a second gold rush in the north has prompted several Australian miners, including PolarX, to set up shop there, despite the harsh climate. Tabeart said that the last two year saw the most mining activity in Alaska in the last decade, which has caught the attention of Australian miners. \"We certainly think it's got potential to grow substantially,\" Tabeart said, speaking on PolarX's gold and copper projects in Alaska. \"The goal for the rest of the year is to continue drilling that with the view that if double or triple the size of that, which is very plausible, we then think we've got something that's going to be of a mineable scale.\"  Alaska has a reputation for being a safe, reliable jurisdiction, but mining during the winters can pose a challenge, said Tabeart. \"Drilling in winter is difficult. We would typically, in our exploration phase, restrict our drilling activities to the May to October period,\" Tabeart told Kitco News on the sidelines of the Noosa Mining &amp; Exploration Conference in Australia.", "id": "90"}
{"content": "(Photo by Tom Pennington/Getty Images)With Chicago Bears linebacker Roquan Smith the final rookie unsigned, there are several significant impacts being made on the team right now.These are unfamiliar waters for Chicago Bears fans. Usually, this team is one of the very first to have all of their draft picks signed. The Bears have been one of the most efficient in doing so for years now, which has given them one less thing to worry about going into training camp and preseason.Right now, what the Bears are dealing with in terms of the Roquan Smith holdout is not only newsworthy and unfamiliar for fans, but it\u2019s newsworthy for the entire NFL. The rest of the league and future players are paying attention to this outcome very carefully, believe you me.Smith, the no. 8 pick out of Georgia in this year\u2019s draft, is represented by the same agency as former no. 3 overall pick Joey Bosa. If you remember, Bosa held out until late August back in 2016. So, in a way, this shouldn\u2019t be too surprising.The difference between Bosa and Smith\u2019s situation, though, is that the NFL introduced a new rule this year which will greatly affect how defenders play the game. Leading with the crown of the helmet is now a major punishable offense; potentially leading to not just a penalty, but an ejection, suspension and/or fine.With Smith holding out so long, there are many impacts. Believe it or not, one could look at some impacts in a positive way \u2014 as tough as that might be to imagine. Let\u2019s dive into five major impacts of what could be a historical holdout.", "id": "91"}
{"content": "Even though it\u2019s all well and good to \u2018count your blessings\u2019 on Thanksgiving and similar holidays, allowing yourself to be grateful during the entire year can beget extraordinary gains for your quality of life.Truthfully, to practise gratitude is probably one of the best things you can do for your health that\u2019s normally neglected. Improving your sense of gratefulness doesn\u2019t have to come with any monetary costs and it definitely doesn\u2019t have to take a lot of time, however, the advantages are tremendous.      Studies now show that showing gratitude can provide the following benefits:1. Gratefulness opens up the opportunity to have more relationships. According to a 2014 study issued in Emotion, saying, \u201cthank you\u201d doesn\u2019t only develop great manners, but bestowing your thankfulness can support you in winning new friends and influencing people.The research discovered that praising a new associate makes the other person more inclined to explore a more ongoing connection. So whether you are thanking a random stranger for keeping the door open, or just sending a prompt thank-you message to your co-worker that assisted you with your project, taking into account the other person\u2019s participation can grow into budding relationships.     2. Being grateful enhances your physical well-being. Thankful people encounter fewer physical discomforts and they describe how they feel better than people in similar situations, based on a 2012 examination printed in Personality and Individual Differences.Not markedly suspicious, people that show gratefulness more often are also more apt to stay on top of their health. They work out more regularly and are more inclined to go to routine check-ups with their physicians, which is why they experience extra longevity.3. Being thankful enhances mental health as well. Gratitude decreases a variety of toxic feeling, varying from resentment and envy to regret and frustration. Robert A. Emmons, Ph.D., who\u2019s a leader in the research on gratefulness, has directed many investigations on the connection between well-being and gratitude. This analysis verifies that gratitude effectively boosts happiness and subdues depression.     4. Gratefulness reduces aggression and improves empathy. According to a 2012 inquiry by the University of Kentucky, people who are grateful are more prone to act in a mutually advantageous fashion, even if other people are acting less than kind.Research participants that scored higher with gratefulness rankings were less disposed to act in an antisocial way, even when supplied with negative feedback. They encountered more empathy and sensitivity from other people and a diminished propensity to attempt revenge.5. Thankful people have better sleep. According to a 2011 investigation issued by Applied Psychology: Health and Well-Being, writing down your in a gratitude diary promote better sleep.6. Being thankful will enhance your self-esteem. Studies show that gratefulness improved an athlete\u2019s self-esteem according to the Journal of Applied Sports Psychology. This is a critical element of elevated achievement.Additional research has proven that gratitude lowers social judgments. Instead of being envious towards others that may have more money or gainful employment \u2013 which is one main factor of lowered self-esteem, people that show appreciation can acknowledge other\u2019s achievements.7. Praise improves mental fortitude. For many years, studies have revealed that thankfulness doesn\u2019t just reduce anxiety, but it can play a supportive function in mastering trauma. Studies showed that Vietnam Vets with greater levels of appreciation endured reduced amounts of PTSD, according to a 2006 inquiry written in Behavior Research and Therapy. It was discovered that being grateful was a primary contributor to increased resilience after those traumatic experiences.Realizing and taking account of everything that you have to be thankful for \u2013 also throughout the most distressed parts of your life \u2013 encourages resilience.Studies by the Northeastern University have observed that those who practise gratitude for the little things were more composed and able to make better choices, as opposed to the individuals that weren\u2019t feeling very gracious on a regular basis.Each one of us possesses the capacity and possibility to develop a greater sense of gratefulness. Just set aside a few minutes to direct your attention on all that you\u2019re thankful for \u2013 instead of complaining about everything you believe you should have had by now. Cultivating your \u201cattitude of gratitude\u201d is probably the easiest means of improving your happiness in life as a whole.", "id": "92"}

I did a little Christmas shopping this pass weekend with this outfit. Not really sure what I was going for with this look, but I ended up really liking it. I purchased these striped pants off of\u00a0Revolve Clothing\u00a0and love them. They are extremely comfortable and a nice change from the usual denim jeans. They fit really nice around the hips and I love the laced up detailing in the front. The pants also flare out at the bottom giving off a 70\u2019s vibe. Not at all hard to style. I wanted to balance the outfit with a crop top from\u00a0Fashion Nova. This top is not only super cute, but extremely affordable. It\u2019s got cute ruffle detailing throughout. The long sleeves are nice because the rest of the top is revealing. Styling these pants with the right pair of shoes was the most difficult. I didn\u2019t want to wear heels or sandals so my\u00a0Sam Edelman\u00a0boots were my only option. I kept my boots low-key as I didn\u2019t want them to compete with my pants which were the focal point.I kept this outfit pretty monochromatic with not introducing any other colors besides white and black, but you could totally through some color with your top or accessories. Bag of course is from\u00a0Saint Laurent. Seriously the best mini cross body bag I\u2019ve come across and the gold chain always ties in the outfit together nicely. Now my favorite part of this outfit is definitely the red lips! I think I\u2019ve finally found the perfect red lipstick that feels and looks great. Surprisingly enough, it was\u00a0Sephorawho sold me. Sephora\u2019s Cream Lip Stain in 01 \u2018Always Red\u2019 is the perfect shade of red to wear to all your holiday parties.

That favorite t-shirt of yours or, the denim, the old cupboard, an old plate, an old watch etc. You too might have numerous such things that are almost on the verge of their end, but you still don\u2019t feel like throwing them away or, giving it off to somebody.Ever wondered why?Because all of those things are associated with something that was very close to you. You have some kind of a memory attached to each of those things because of which you don\u2019t want to let it go.So actually it is that memory that is pretty close to your heart which you don\u2019t want to let go off and by merely associating it with something tangible, you are giving that memory a name or, in other words, you are objectifying that memory so that you can keep it close to you.There are many such things that I don\u2019t feel like letting go of.But the fact is that you eventually move on and let go of those things. At some point, though with a heavy heart. And then those memories too, slowly fade away.We (both me and Dilip) had a particular liking for Delhi too. (Yes, a place. That\u2019s also possible)Delhi is called as \u201cDilwalon ki Dilli\u201d meaning that it is the city of the large-hearted. And it is, for more reasons that one.Delhi is a city with a diverse culture. People from all over India come to Delhi and settle there to eventually become a Delhiite. And Delhi always embraces everybody with open arms.We started off in Delhi. Our first jobs, our careers, our business, the city where the two of us met and many such other memories. And when you have too many memories associated with something, you will just not let it go.In spite of the fact that we have been living in Bangalore for more than 6 years now, we somehow still feel like we are Delhiites.A mere mention of Delhi in a discussion within friends or, associates makes us feel as if they are discussing my City. Such is the warmth that the city gives its residents.This attachment was probably one of the reasons we didn\u2019t want to move out of Delhi, initially.

They\u2019re off on Tuesday getting a much-deserved rest.

{"content": "July 25--The non-waiver trade deadline is 3 p.m. Tuesday and Cubs President Theo Epstein said he believes the Cubs will make a deal. Here are some questions and answers regarding the team's needs and the trading landscape.How did the Cubs get to this point with their pitching needs?The starting pitchers haven't pitched deep into games with any regularity, thus causing stress on a bullpen that has been effective and resilient despite injuries to valuable late-inning specialists such as Brandon Morrow and Carl Edwards Jr.Yu Darvish's injury has stretched the depth further. Left-hander reliever Mike Montgomery had to be plugged into the starting rotation and thus left the bullpen without an experienced long reliever. A season-ending injury to top pitching prospect Adbert Alzolay looms even larger, especially because he could have performed the long relief duties and made a spot start or two.The Cubs are in the middle of a stretch playing 12 games in 11 days and will brace themselves for an odyssey in which they are scheduled to play 23 consecutive games without a scheduled day off starting Aug. 21.What teams present potential trade partners?The most likely possible matches include the Orioles, Blue Jays, Royals, Marlins and Padres.Epstein added the Cubs could make a trade for a player whose name hasn't been mentioned frequently as other obvious targets, such as left-handed closer Zach Britton of the Orioles, who was traded to the Yankees on Tuesday.Starter Nathan Eovaldi of the Rays, another pitcher who seemed to fit the Cubs' profile, was traded to the Red Sox on Wednesday. Eovaldi, 28, started the season on the disabled list but has rebounded nicely, going 3-4 in 10 starts with an ERA of 4.26 and a WHIP of 0.98. He's also on an affordable contract -- $2 million this year with incentives that could make it worth another $1.5 million -- but will be an unrestricted free agent after the season.Orioles relievers Mychal Givens (0-6, 4.82 ERA, 1.401 WHIP) and Brad Brach (1-2, 11 saves, 4.69 ERA, 1.769 WHIP) aren't having overwhelming seasons but could help the Cubs bullpen. Left-hander Adam Conley (3-1, 2.63 ERA, 0.915 WHIP) of the Marlins is enjoying a career-best season and possesses better control than teammate Kyle Barraclough, (0-4, 2.45 ERA, 1.068 WHIP) who has struck out 50 but walked 24 in 44 innings. Both players are arbitration eligible this winter, so the price tag could be steep.Tyson Ross (6-8, 4.29 ERA, 1.288 WHIP) of the Padres, whom the Cubs courted before the 2017 season while he was recovering from a shoulder injury, has made 20 starts. Dodgers radio announcer Kevin Kennedy observed during a July 12 start that Ross's mechanics weren't smooth, but Ross managed to no-hit the Dodgers for 5 1/3 innings.A few years ago, general manager Jed Hoyer quipped that the Cubs someday would make a deal with the Mets. But any potential trade is unlikely to involve Jacob deGrom because of the projected asking price and the lack of prospects needed to satisfy the Mets.Epstein said Sunday that an impact trade would be difficult, but the pool of potential trade partners could expand as more teams fade from playoff contention.Who might be dealt from the Cubs farm system?For starters, the Cubs are reluctant to move anyone from the current major-league roster. Also trading Gleyber Torres, Eloy Jimenez and Dylan Cease has sapped the organization of some of its top prospects.A few scouts have inquired about David Bote, whose stock has ascended and would be on the major-league roster full time if there were a spot for him. One scout asked, \"I like him, but where do you play him?\" My answer: \"In the batter's box.\" Bote has displayed adequate versatility around the infield, but he might be too valuable to the Cubs as an insurance policy as manager Joe Maddon wisely monitors Ben Zobrist's playing time and Kris Bryant's lingering shoulder problems.I don't see many untouchables, although 19-year-old catcher Miguel Amaya has ascended impressively this season. Amaya has an .803 OPS with 12 homers and 44 RBI in 85 games for Class A South Bend. The Cubs also invested heavily in 2017 first-round picks Brendon Little and Alex Lange as they try to bolster their pitching depth, which has suffered a hit because of the injury to Alzolay, a suspension to Oscar De La Cruz and the struggles of Jose Albertos.Why didn't the Cubs make a push for Manny Machado?Machado would have been a luxury, not a need. The Cubs don't possess the depth of prospects the Dodgers surrendered to acquire Machado, who is a free agent after this season.Why is it difficult to make deals after July 31?Teams with a worse record than the Cubs can put in a waiver claim to block them from acquiring the player. There's also the fear of putting in a claim on a player with an expensive contract and being stuck with that contract if the team with that player's rights simply awards the player and the balance of the contract to the claiming team.The Cubs put in a claim on Chase Utley a few years ago, but Utley had the right to choose the team and selected the Dodgers in part because of their proximity to his West Coast roots.What post-July 31 targets could the Cubs address?Possibly another versatile defender or a base-running specialist. The Cubs added speedster Quintin Berry in late August of 2015 after the Red Sox released him, and they traded for outfielder Leonys Martin from the Mariners on Aug. 31, 2017.mgonzales@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "98"}
{"content": "The schedule for Alabama Basketball is beginning to fill out, adding another key non-conference opponent in the Stephen F. Austin Lumberjacks.Teams are starting to release their full schedules, but Alabama fans are getting their news through other teams. Another key addition to the Tide\u2019s schedule was released as Stephen F. Austin announced that they will be hosting \u2018Bama in December. Coach Avery Johnson will return the favor next season when the Lumberjacks come to Coleman.Both teams are coming off of a March Madness Tournament bid last year. Alabama made it to the second round as a 9 seed, and SF Austin lost in the first round to Texas Tech as a 14 seed. The Lumberjacks are one of the greatest home teams in the country, losing only two games in their arena last year. Alabama was known last year for under-performing on the road, but that should improve after the team played got more experience in the postseason.What this means for AlabamaIf Alabama wants to make it to the Tournament again this season, they will most likely have to gain an at-large bid. Having a strong non-conference schedule is a great step for them to gain respect from the committee. If Alabama can compete against tournament-eligible teams, they help their odds of dancing immensely. Alabama doesn\u2019t have to specifically win this game, but they definitely need to compete.This game puts SF Austin on the list of non-conference opponents that already includes Baylor, Arizona, UCF, and Northeastern, with only the Arizona game being at home. If Alabama can compete against these teams like they did against Oklahoma and Minnesota last year, they can definitely be in a great spot to earn a bid in March.What this means for SF AustinThe Lumberjacks usually earn a bid by winning their conference. This means that their regular season is all about preparing to compete in the postseason as opposed to proving something to a committee. The Alabama game will test SFA in December. It should give them a chance to fight in a more competitive game than their conference might allow.The length of Herbert Jones, John Petty, and Donta Hall will prepare them for anything the Southland Conference has to offer. It is always easier to learn from adversity than it is to learn from cakewalks. A Power 5 opponent in the Tide will most certainly give the \u2018Jacks their fair share of problems.Assuming both teams are as competitive as we expect them to come December, this should be a game that will make both fan bases excited as it approaches. Expect William R. Johnson Coliseum to be packed in purple and for the Crimson Chaos to be supporting either in the arena or by their TVs in Tuscaloosa.", "id": "99"}
{"content": "Maybe it was the raucous atmosphere at a political forum teetering into a free-for-all; maybe it was that no one had ever asked him publicly. But on Wednesday night in New Haven, Ned Lamont said Joe Ganim should have been eligible for public campaign financing if he was allowed to run for governor.  Lamont made that statement in an evening dedicated in part to Latino issues, in a boisterous, placard-toting crowd at Albertus Magnus College. The obvious follow-up question for Lamont, the endorsed Democrat: Should Ganim have been allowed to run?  \u201cThe laws of the state of Connecticut say if you\u2019ve served your time, you have a chance to run, you have a chance to serve,\u201d Lamont said.  Afterward, Lamont clarified. \u201cIf he\u2019s qualified to run for governor, which he wouldn\u2019t be in probably 30 other states, then he deserves the public financing.\u201d                              He added, \u201cWhether he deserves to be governor is another question.\u201d  Ganim, in his second stint as Bridgeport mayor after serving seven years in the federal slammer for shaking down city contractors, petitioned his way onto the Aug. 14 primary ballot with signatures. Earlier this year he was denied public financing as an ex-felon. Even with a $60,000 loan from himself to his own campaign, his total raised as of June 30 was $676,481 -- far less than the $1.35 million grant he\u2019d have gotten for the primary if he qualified for state financing under Connecticut\u2019s clean election laws.  \u201cI appreciate that perspective,\u201d Ganim said to Lamont as the two combatants sat inches from each other, side-by-side in a hot hall.    Ganim talked about regaining trust, a theme he repeats at every appearance - and portrayed himself as David vs. a financial Goliath in his bid against Lamont, who listed his family wealth at $90 million to $300 million in federal filings 12 years ago.  Lamont had raised $189,000 from contributors and spent $924,016 as of June 30 -- and is also not participating in the public financing program, so he can spend as much of his own money as he chooses.  \u201cI\u2019d like to think that even without public funding, with a grassroots effort, both for votes and for money, that it will be people over power,\u201d Ganim said.  Earlier Wednesday, at a meeting of the Hearst Connecticut Media Group editorial board, Ganim said he considered limiting his fundraising to $100 increments to meet the public financing requirements even after he was rejected - which might have set him up to mount a legal challenge to collect $6 million in public funding for a general election if he were to win the primary. Now, he can\u2019t bring such a challenge even if he wins because he didn\u2019t adhere to the fundraising limits.  \u201cWe had to make a decision, was it to try and be competitive in a court case and probably ineffective in a campaign,\u201d Ganim said, \u201cor move forward?\u201d With the specter of a months-long court case, he gave up on public financing.  He again called for financial disclosures and criticized Lamont\u2019s wealth, which is both earned and inherited - a bit that plays well with urban audiences such as the \"Greater New Haven Votes 2018\" forum sponsored by the Community Foundation for Greater New Haven.  \u201cI\u2019ve got nothing to hide, I\u2019m proud of how I\u2019ve earned my money, I work my heart out every day,\u201d Lamont said. \u201cI\u2019ve created businesses, I\u2019ve created jobs\u2026 and my wife has worked her heart out, so I\u2019m proud of what we did, I\u2019m not going to apologize for that.\u201d His wife, Annie Huntress Lamont, is a longtime venture capital investor who founded her own firm to finance health care and financial technology startups.  Lamont called for unity. \u201cYou want a Democrat fighting to make sure everybody of color, immigrants in our society, are protected and we don\u2019t want the Trump onslaught coming through.\u201d", "id": "100"}
{"content": "The Miami Dolphins are not practicing today as they get their first break since camp started a week ago. It\u2019s been longer for the rookies.The Miami Dolphins rookies reported on July 18th and the veterans followed on the 25th. Now with five full practices in the can the players can take a breath and get out of the hot Florida sun.Over the past five days there has been some pretty good highlights and some lowlights. Here is a look at the players that are showing up ready to play and the ones who are not making a case for a roster spot or at the very least not impressing.Overall: The Dolphins are generating positives on both sides of the ball and almost all of the media members have said that this team this year looks a lot different from years past. In a positive way. That\u2019s good because typically they are a sounding board for everything that is going wrong. Not so much this year. Granted it\u2019s still early.Offense on the riseIsaiah Ford \u2013 the 2nd year receiver showed up to camp ready go and he has impressed everyone from the media to his coaches to his quarterback. Ford is making a strong case for the final 53 but what he does in pre-season games will decide his future.Ryan Tannehill \u2013 Tannehill is impressing everyone with his attitude, his passing motion, footwork, throws, and reads. His knee is also, thus far, been a non-issue. Oh, and he is showing a lot of leadership.Danny Amendola \u2013 There is a definite rapport building between Amendola and Tannehill and this could be a big year for the receiver. His work ethic is starting to bleed over on other players.Mike Gesicki \u2013 After a quite start, Gesicki is making big plays and catches and his blocking is improving. He is generating a lot of positive buzz.Albert Wilson \u2013 His speed has been impressive and the fact that he is now considered an \u201coutside\u201d guy means we will see more of him in the weeks to come.Offense on the fallDeVante Parker \u2013 Parker is not having a bad camp he just isn\u2019t having a great camp and for the Dolphins and their fans, they want more. Parker needs to turn it up.Leonte Carroo \u2013 There is nothing special here because he has not practiced much. He had a clean-out procedure done in the off-season but he is clearly on the proverbial bubble this year and is losing opportunity.Defense on the riseTorry McTyer \u2013 He has earned time with the number one unit at corner and is impressing everyone with his speed and athleticism. He has turned a two-man competition between Cordrea Tankersley and Tony Lippett into a three-man competition.Tony Lippett \u2013 Lippett is returning from his Achilles injury of year ago and he looks better than he did before he got hurt. Lippett is bringing a lot to the three-man competition.Xavien Howard \u2013 Howard has basically taken DeVante Parker out of the offense. He looks like a shut down corner which is what safety T.J. McDonald called him.Raekwon McMillan \u2013 There hasn\u2019t been much about McMillan outside of his leadership role but there has been nothing negative about him either.Minkah Fitzpatrick \u2013 The kid is a football player and so far he is impressing his fellow defensive players and the guys on offense. There is a learning curve and he seems to be finding his way through it. Chase Allen \u2013 Allen has intercepted two or three passes already and seems to be around the ball all of the time and in position to make plays. The coaches are watching him closely and solid pre=season performances could land him a starting job on the outside linebacker unit.Defense on the fallNo one \u2013 There has not been a lot of negatives through the first week of practice. Not enough to say someone is practicing their way out of a roster spot. There are good competitions going on and the players are getting better each day.Special TeamsJason Sanders \u2013 Sanders has a \u201cleg\u201d up on his competition. He has been very good through camp so far and while I am sure he has missed a field goal or two there hasn\u2019t been any mention of it. He did make all of his kicks the first day of practice including from over 50 yards.Greg Joseph \u2013 Joseph has not had a comparable camp to Sanders and it appears that it is Sanders\u2019 job to lose unless the Dolphins bring in a veteran to compete.", "id": "101"}
{"content": "EARLY MORNING SURPRISE. At around 6 AM PT Thursday morning, Virgin Galactic, the aerospace company founded by Richard Branson, took to Twitter to casually announce plans to test one of its SpaceShipTwo (SS2) spaceplanes.Roughly three-and-a-half hours later, the spaceplane, named the VSS Unity, took off from the Mojave Air and Space Port in Mojave, CA. About 20 minutes after that, it touched down. No livestream, no press release \u2014 just a dozen or so Twitter posts, and it was over.SUPERSONIC SPACEPLANE. Launching a SS2 is pretty different from a typical rocket launch. Instead of launching vertically, a jet-powered craft called a White Knight Two (WK2) takes off horizontally like a plane, carrying a SS2 up to its launch altitude of 15 kilometers (9.4 miles). The SS2 then separates from the carrier vehicle and flies into the upper atmosphere. Both craft later landing on a runway just like planes.For Thursday\u2019s launch, the WK2 was named VMS Eve. This was VMS Eve\u2019s 252nd flight and VSS Unity\u2019s 14th, but it was only the third rocket-powered test flight for VSS Unity (in some test flights, it never separated from its carrier; in others, it separated but didn\u2019t ignite its engines, simply gliding without power). According to Virgin Galactic\u2019s Twitter posts, the goal of today\u2019s test was to \u201cgather more data on supersonic flight, aerodynamics, as well as thermal dynamics,\u201d as well as analyze the conditions within Unity\u2019s cabin.ONE LAUNCH CLOSER. On Wednesday, Bloomberg published a video interview with Virgin Galactic CEO Richard Branson in which he asserted the company is closing in on its goal of sending people to space. \u201cBefore the end of the year, I hope to be sitting in a Virgin Galactic spaceship, going to space,\u201d he told interviewer David Rubenstein. If and when that happens, expect to hear a lot about it.", "id": "102"}

{"content": "Samsung has developed the world\u2019s first unbreakable OLED display, which survived 26 consecutive drops. When will it appear on smartphones and other electronic devices, though? ( Samsung )Samsung's foldable smartphone dreams are becoming realer by the day \u2014 the company has apparently been testing an unbreakable OLED display by inflicting it with all kinds of damage yet the phone still came out unscathed.Flexible OLED panels have been around for many years, although their implementations have been limited. Companies typically put the flexible panel behind a sheet of protective glass, but Samsung's unbreakable OLED display innovates that entirely: the panel already has a plastic cover attached, which is supposed to mimic the properties of glass but retain the screen's flexibility \u2014 and because the display doesn't require a protective sheet of glass, it's been proven rugged enough to receive UL certification for its sheer durability.How Samsung Made An Unbreakable OLED Display\"The fortified plastic window is especially suitable for portable electronic devices not only because of its unbreakable characteristics, but also because of its lightweight, transmissivity and hardness, which are all very similar to glass,\" said Hojung Kim of Samsung Display.According to Samsung, this unbreakable OLED display was able to withstand UL's military-standard tests that involved dropping the device 26 times in a row from a height of 1.2 meters, or about 4 feet. It also survived temperatures as high as 71 degrees Celsius and as low as -32 degrees Celsius. The panel \"continued to function normally with no damage to its front, sides, or edges,\" says Samsung, and the company even took it up a notch by dropping the phone from 1.8 meters, or about 6 feet.Obviously, the company could one day incorporate this display into its smartphones and most likely sell it to others as well, including smartphone companies that already buy displays from it, such as Apple, which purchases Samsung's OLED panels for the iPhone X. But it could also be used in other devices, including gaming consoles, tablets, in-car displays, and other electronics often prone to damage.When Will Samsung Roll Out The Unbreakable OLED Display?Samsung didn't say when this display will roll out to the market, and when it plans to mass-produce the component. Even still, this is certainly great news for manufacturers because once it comes to market, they'll be able to experiment with more bezel-less screen designs and remain confident that the screen won't break.For consumers, meanwhile, that means less money spent on screen repairs. Then again, better not get one's hopes up \u2014 there's a possibility Samsung chucks the whole thing in the bin if it finds any inherent problems with the display's construction.

{"content": "A team of scientists confirmed that the sun was once a juvenile being just like the other stars. The confirmation came after analysis of ancient blue crystals called the hibonite. ( Field Museum And Prof. Andrew M. Davis | University Of Chicago )Astronomers have previously identified stars to be extremely energetic during their early lives, but they were not sure about the sun's behavior during its juvenile stage.Now, ancient and rare blue crystals called the hibonite from about 4.5 billion years ago confirmed that the sun used to be as hyperactive. Think of the sun with the energy of a three-year-old kid, except that the sun was just a newborn when it behaved like a toddler.As a juvenile star, the sun erupted habitually, churning out voluminous high-energy particles. The ancient blue crystals trapped in meteorites revealed this rowdy behavior. These minerals may probably be the first minerals formed in the Solar System, according to the scientists with the University of Chicago, the Field Museum, and ETH Zurich, who performed the study on the hibonite.Ancient Blue Hibonite CrystalsFor their study, published in Nature Astronomy on July 30, the scientists examined the chemical reactions that took place in the creation of the microscopic ice-blue crystals. Their analysis revealed that as the sun spewed loads of energetic particles, some of the protons hit the calcium and aluminum in the blue hibonite crystals. The force caused the atoms to split into tinier atoms of neon and helium.The neon and helium particles were trapped inside the hibonite for billions of years, merging in the space rocks where scientists have discovered them.The larger mineral grain found in space rocks are usually only a few times larger than the diameter of a human hair, said Andy Davis, co-author for the study. When the team examined these particles, the hibonite stood out as the tiniest light blue crystals.Levke K\u00f6\u00f6p, the lead author of the study, explained that hibonite crystals measure less than 100 microns across. Even with this minuscule size, however, K\u00f6\u00f6p said the ancient blue crystals were able to retain the highly volatile gases produced by the young sun's erratic behavior billions of years ago.The Hyperactive Juvenile SunThe young sun, in its days before the planets were formed, contained a massive disk of gas and dust that spiraled around the Solar System. The sun at this time was hot, more than 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit. Venus, in comparison, can already melt lead with its temperature of 872 degrees Fahrenheit.When the sun's disk of gas and dust calmed down, the blue hibonite crystals were eventually formed. Unlike the more tranquil adult sun that people knew now, the juvenile sun had, however, kept on shooting its loads of high energy, hitting the crystals over and over again, causing the chemical reactions to happen for numerous times.\"It'd be like if you only knew someone as a calm adult \u2014 you'd have reason to believe they were once an active child, but no proof. But if you could go up into their attic and find their old broken toys and books with the pages torn out, it'd be evidence that the person was once a high-energy toddler,\" explained Philipp Heck, one of the authors of the study.", "id": "105"}
{"content": "I'm frankly appalled by what I'm seeing in the IPO marketplace right now. A whopping 120 companies have raised just over $35 billion through the first half of the year on U.S. stock exchanges. That puts 2018 on track to be the second-busiest IPO year (besides 2012) since ... drumroll please ... the 2000 peak of the dot-com bubble. If the companies coming out of the chute were solid ones with long histories of profitable operations and time-tested business models, I wouldn't worry. But the sludge that's running down Wall Street is entirely different. Take a company called iQIYI (IQ) . It's a Chinese video streaming service majority-owned by Baidu (BIDU) that's been operating since 2010. Unfortunately, in every single one of those eight years, it lost money. That includes $554 million in 2017, $463 million in 2016 and $410 million in 2015. What about the future? It must look better or the \"Netflix (NFLX) of China\" wouldn't have been able to go public in a March IPO that raised $2.25 billion, right? Nope! As of June, analysts were forecasting losses to surge to $789 million in 2018 and $723 million in 2019. Again, let me repeat that for emphasis: eight years of operation \u2026 eight years of losses ... and another $1.5-billion-plus in losses likely over the next 2 years (at least).  Yet for a time, investors piled into IQ shares like the company was spinning straw into gold. The stock soared from its $18 IPO price to more than $46 in mid-June, a gain of 155% in just a few weeks. But IQ is far from alone. Take Dropbox (DBX) . It lost $325.9 million in 2015, $210.2 million in 2016 and another $111.7 million in 2017. Yet it went public in March, raising $756 million. Spotify (SPOT) racked up red ink of $268 million in 2015, $629 million in 2016 and a stunning $1.45 billion in 2017. Yet it went public through a direct listing in April that valued the company at around $27 billion. Those are just the ones you've probably heard of because they get so much digital ink. There are plenty of also-rans and \"Me Too\" companies slinging their shares, just like two decades ago. Take HyreCar (HYRE) , whose business model revolves around connecting wannabe Uber and Lyft drivers with people who have idle cars they don't mind renting out to them. It managed to raise $12.6 million last month despite the fact it sported operating losses of $800,000 in 2016 and $4.1 million in 2017. Or how about DOMO Inc. (DOMO) , the cloud computing company? It raised $193 million in June ... despite losing $176 million in fiscal 2018 and $183 million in 2017. Then there's Bilibili (BILI) , a Chinese provider of online entertainment including videos, mobile games and anime content. It lost $57 million in 2015, $129 million in 2016, and $34 million in 2017 ... yet still managed to raise $483 million in its March IPO. Another Chinese tech play, the \"used car e-commerce platform\" Uxin (UXIN) , followed Bilibili with its own $225 million IPO. That's money it could really use, considering it racked up operating losses of $188.5 million in 2016 and $270 million in 2017.  Of course, money-losing, traditional tech companies aren't the only wing-and-a-prayer firms with their hands out. Money-losing biotechs have been raising (and burning through!) gobs of money, too. In a single 24-hour period\u2014 June 20-21 \u2014 five biotechs priced their IPOs. They raised a total of around $460 million, making it the most active day for biotech deals in U.S. history. Yet not a single one of them was profitable. That included Avrobio (AVRO) , with full-year 2017 losses of $18.6 million, Aptiny (APTX) , with 2017 losses of $32.1 million, Magenta Therapeutics (MGTA) , with losses of $35.5 million, Kezar Life Sciences (KZR) , with losses of $8.5 million and Xeris Pharmaceuticals (XERS) , with losses of $26.6 million. For good measure, Eidos Therapeutics (EIDX) went public a day earlier. It lost $11.9 million in 2017. So, what do I think about the tech IPO mania? What do I believe the future holds for many of these companies, the ones gobbling up billions of dollars in capital like Pac-Man on a blue ghost bender? Well, more than halfthe dot-com darlings of the late 1990s eventually went up in smoke. Not every one of the companies I just mentioned is destined for the dustbin of history. But given the gobs and gobs of red ink they're racking up, and the half-baked business models many of them are pursuing, there will be financial carnage. Lots of it. Heck, it may not even take all that long to get started. That's because many of the stocks are already tanking! Bottom line: When you combine the IPO frenzy with all the other manic market behavior out there, you don't exactly get a happy-go-lucky picture of market stability. Instead, it looks exactly like what you'd expect to see in the final death throes of a deflating \"Everything Bubble.\" Wall Street analysts and the mainstream financial press want to talk FANG, FANG, FANG (Facebook (FB) , Apple (AAPL) , Netflix (NFLX) , Alphabet (GOOGL) all day long. That's because these \"hot\" stocks boost their ratings, commissions and fund inflows. But with the yield curve collapsing \u2026 the Federal Reserve raising rates steadily \u2026 and signs of credit stress increasing by the day, mark my words: Those ultra-high-risk companies are likely headed straight into a brick wall. So, the only sensible course of action in my book is to:  Continue to maintain a much higher cash position than in years past. The model portfolio currently has about 40% in cash, up sharply from our previous fully invested stance.  Move up the quality scale for any remaining stocks you hold. By that, I mean get rid of higher-risk garbage names like those I just mentioned. Focus instead on higher-rated, higher-yielding, more stable names.  Hedge against weakness \u2014 or target downside profits \u2014 using specialized tools like inverse ETFs. The ProShares UltraShort Financials (SKF) and ProShares UltraShort Euro (EUO) are two I've zeroed in on so far, and they're both working out nicely for you.

{"content": "New teammates OG Anunoby and Kawhi Leonard are remarkably similar on and off the court\u2014 versatile defenders, gym-rats and stoic by nature. Who better to teach the Raptors rookie sensation the path from role player to NBA superstardom?Here\u2019s a crazy idea: OG Anunoby is the second coming of Kawhi Leonard. At least that\u2019s what Toronto Raptors executives want to believe and it\u2019s easy to see why.Their origin stories are strikingly similar. On the court, Leonard and Anunoby are both long and athletic players with great defensive instincts, capable of guarding multiple positions. Many teams passed on them in the NBA Draft because of their offensive limitations. However, from humble beginnings, each player proved themselves with their defensive versatility (and surprising offensive contributions) to play significant minutes as rookies on a contending team. During the playoffs, they showed great poise, elevating their game to new heights.Personality-wise, they\u2019re like two peas in a pod. Leonard shies away from media attention, rarely shows emotion and is practically mute (to a fault). While Anunoby shows a bit more flair (he wears tight short shorts), he too keeps his sentences short and emotional flourishes to a minimum.Now that they\u2019ll share the court together, the rookie sensation has a great opportunity. Here are three things that Anunoby can learn from the silent superstar to take his game to the next level.Polishing his shooting strokeLet\u2019s start with the obvious. OG Anunoby needs to improve his jump shot to become an all-around threat in the NBA. In his rookie season, he shot 47 percent from the field and 37 percent from three but on limited attempts. In January, he hit the proverbial rookie wall, when he averaged his lowest points per game and three-point percentage, before recovering to finish off the season. Anunoby has decent form on his shot but it appears a bit rigid and inconsistent.Enter Leonard. Coming into the NBA during the 2011-12 season, his shooting mechanics were suspect. In his two college seasons at San Diego State, he made 41 3-pointers on 164 attempts (25 percent). There was no fluidity, with the ball resting over or behind his head when shooting and his body unbalanced.Making snap decisions Last season, Anunoby\u2019s role on offense was fairly limited. Spot up in the corner for threes, run in transition, grab offensive rebounds and occasionally drive to the basket. Part of this was by design. While Raptors ran a more egalitarian offense than years past, Lowry and DeRozan tended to dominate possessions, especially in the clutch. They handled the ball, made key decisions and created opportunities when plays broke down.However, the main reason was that Anunoby wasn\u2019t ready to accept that sort of responsibility. His ball handling and playmaking skills are still subpar and he needs to learn to read the situation on the floor and react appropriately. To his credit, Anunoby has shown flashes of improvement during the Summer League and he\u2019ll get plenty of opportunities this coming season.If he wants to accelerate the process, he can look at Leonard\u2019s evolution into a playmaking forward. Under the tutelage of Greg Popovich, Leonard added an arsenal of moves, tightened his handle, increased his assist rate, decreased his turnovers while improving his scoring out of the pick and roll. With repetition and encouragement, Kawhi honed his decision-making abilities and now regularly finds the most efficient shot for himself and others. The key is that he never seems to force things, a valuable lesson for Anunoby.Nightmare on defenseWith the NBA shifting to small ball, players like Leonard and Anunoby are invaluable on defense. They fit the profile of a versatile player who can do pretty much everything.As Leonard\u2019s doppelganger, Anunoby has the potential to be just as suffocating. With large hands, a 7\u20196\u201d wingspan, chiselled frame and quick feet, Anunoby is built to be an elite defensive stopper. While defense is already his calling card, he still needs to improve his understanding of small details like angles and spacing to take the next step.Work ethic over everythingNot everyone gets better. As any successful person knows, raw talent without work ethic equals no results.Fortunately, OG Anunoby has both in spades. Just like Leonard, he is on track for a quiet, almost invisible ascendance to superstardom. And who knows, as a kindred spirit he might be the edge the Raptors need to convince Kawhi Leonard to stay in Toronto long term.", "id": "107"}
{"content": "Valve revealed the \"Artifact\" release date and price on Steam, hyping up the digital card game. It has been described as a combination of \"Dota 2\" and \"Magic: The Gathering,\" but how does it compare to \"Hearthstone?\" ( Valve | Steam )Artifact, the first new Valve game in five years after Counter-Strike: Global Offensive in 2013, finally has a release date and price, with more details revealed for the digital card game.Valve announced Artifact at The International, the premier Dota 2 tournament, last year. Gamers were disappointed because many hoped that it would be the long-awaited Half-Life 3. However, Artifact is shaping up to be an interesting game from what has been revealed so far.'Artifact' Release Date And PriceValve revealed through Steam that the Artifact release date will be on Nov. 28 for every major PC platform, including Windows, Mac, and Linux. A mobile version of the digital card game, meanwhile, is planned to launch in 2019.Is Artifact a free-to-play game? Unfortunately, unlike Blizzard's Hearthstone, Artifact will be a paid game. Players will need to pay $20 as a buy-in fee, giving them access to a pair of premade base decks that contain 54 cards, composed of 5 heroes, 9 items, and 40 other cards.Players will also receive 10 booster packs that contain 12 random cards each as part of the initial $20 cost. Additional booster packs may be purchased at $2 each.Players who attend PAX West, which will run from Aug. 31 to Sept. 3 at the Washington State Convention Center in Seattle, will be able to try the first public hands-on demo of Artifact. They will each receive two free keys to unlock the base model of the game upon its launch, bypassing the $20 cost.'Artifact' GameplayAn early hands-on preview by Rock Paper Shotgun revealed that Artifact will feature the three-lane gameplay that is seen in Dota 2 and other similar MOBAs. The website's Austin Wood described Artifact as \"an ambitious hybrid\" of Dota 2 and Magic: The Gathering. This is not surprising given the role of Richard Garfield, the Magic: The Gathering creator, in its development.Each lane has one enemy tower and one friendly tower. Players win in Artifact by destroying two enemy towers or killing the Ancient that appears when a tower is taken down.One of the biggest differences between Artifact and other card games is the lack of traditional turns. Instead, players take rounds, which consists of launching actions and engaging battles in all three lanes.The rules of Artifact shows a lot of things to digest, though players will have more than three months to prepare for the digital card game's arrival. It might not be Half-Life 3, but it may have what it takes to be an instant hit.", "id": "108"}
{"content": "Devices running Android P can\u2019t have more than two notches, according to Google. Also, manufacturers can\u2019t place a notch on the left and right sections, only the top and bottom. ( Huawei )Google has now laid down the law of the land when it comes to phone notches \u2014 a mobile device shouldn't have more than two, the company says.The Mountain View, California, search company developed notch support for Android P fairly recently after phone makers started copying the iPhone X design. So now it wants to enforce some ground rules in case anyone is planning to go crazy with their respective notch design.A Phone Can't Have This Many Notches, According To GoogleIn a blog post addressing developers, Android UI product manager Megan Potoski said that Google is working with device partners to \"mandate a few requirements\" for app compatibility purposes. Notch limits are among those requirements.Android P devices can't have more than two notch cutouts. Manufacturers are only allowed to put a single notch on each side of the device, and they're not allowed to put them on the left and right portions of a surface \u2014 only the top and bottom.Granted, no manufacturers have come out with more than one notch thus far, so Google's preemptive strike on the notch craze is all theoretical. Even still, there's reason to believe multi-notch phones are going to happen eventually, so Google's thought process must have been, \"They're going to go insane with notches; might as well set ground rules now.\"The restrictions don't mean that Google intends to interfere with manufacturer's design ideas for smartphones. Rather, they want to make sure Android P will run smoothly and look user-friendly on any device, notch or no notch. Companies are welcome to design phones with more than two notches. Heck, they can even go completely bonkers and put 23 notches in there, but they will have to find another operating system that can support that because Android P simply won't accommodate that kind of design.Why Google Is Laying Down Notch RestrictionsThe real point to these restrictions, as The Verge notes, is to make sure apps run properly no matter which device they're installed in. It's necessary for Google to enforce these rules because some notches cut into the actual content on screen, making it hard to see them clearly. Android P wants to make sure that never happens.\"The good news is, for the most part your app should work as intended even on a cutout device,\" according to Potoski.The final version of Android P is supposed to roll out near the end of summer, though it likely won't make its way to commercial devices until the end of fall. Google says Android now runs on 16 phones with notches from a number of different companies, and that is likely to grow in the coming year.", "id": "109"}
{"content": "July 31--As August creeps into view, the once-charming summer commute into Chicago -- golden outlines of buildings alongside the train tracks and Lake Shore Drive, a cool breeze on your face -- becomes a sweaty endeavor marked by crowded bodies, the stench of city garbage and exacerbated FOMO (\"fear of missing out\") from missing another perfect beach day.But imagine a weekday morning when, instead of rushing into the office with a sweating iced coffee and pit stains to match, you were calm. Confident. Even looking forward to your workday.Wellness experts think such a thing is possible, part of a movement that prizes self-awareness and making small, conscious steps toward a healthier, fulfilling life -- like adjusting your morning commute routine.Judy Manisco, a registered nutritionist and dietitian in Chicago, believes that slight meal adjustments could drastically improve commuters' well-being before work. \"The key is to wake up early enough where you're not running around, stressed about getting to work on time, but pacing yourself and eating a healthy breakfast before work,\" she says.Manisco suggests a balance of protein and carbohydrates to keep you full and energized until lunch. Her favorite breakfast? \"A protein shake made from organic soy milk, raw, unsalted walnuts (they're high in nutrient-dense omega-3 fatty acids), a variety of seeds, oat bran and either a stock of celery or a handful of spinach,\" Manisco says. For sweetness, she recommends adding natural cocoa or a date.If you skip the protein shake, Manisco recommends whole-grain toast, a handful of nuts or seeds, and a cup of fruit. She warns against coffee. \"Caffeine will get your heart and adrenals pumping artificially, and thus could have you feeling unnecessarily anxious or depressed,\" Manisco says.Diet isn't the only trick to incorporating wellness into your morning commute. Paying attention to posture and movement can also help.Jason Kart, a practicing physical therapist for 10 years and the owner of Core Physical Therapy in Chicago, says lower back and neck pain are the most \"common ailments\" among his working patients. \"When you sit for a while, you turn your postural muscles off and you start using passive structures like cartilage, which breaks down easier,\" Kart says. \"Humans are built to walk around and look for food, so when you're sitting, you're not activating those important spinal muscles, but instead causing a steady breakdown of muscle tissue.\"Kart takes Metra to work each morning and notices the same behavior causing neck pain among commuters: \"text neck.\" \"Text neck\" occurs when you lean your head over your phone, straining your neck muscles and thus causing joint pain. To alleviate this, Kart recommends a simple fix: \"If you're standing on the 'L' or Metra, the movement of the train helps you practice stability and balance and work your postural muscles,\" he says.And for car drivers who can't stand during their commute? Consider the headrest. \"Bad posture is so common among drivers ... they should practice keeping their head lightly against the headrest and avoid a slouch position,\" he says. \"This will gradually alleviate back and neck pain while driving.\" At work, Kart suggests periodically moving around to engage the postural muscles most commonly associated with neck and back pain.After considering your stomach and your spine, think of your brain. One of the most popular sectors of wellness is mindfulness. Darrell Jones, general manager of Chill Chicago: Meditation and Massage and a meditation instructor, meditates on the train during his commute and recommends the practice to anyone who wants to feel \"calmer and happier\" entering their workspace.Annoyed by the loud chatter or the loudspeaker on the train? \"Incorporate those sounds and how they make you feel into your meditation,\" Jones says. He recommends the guided meditation on apps like Calm, or finding a piece of instrumental classical, jazz, world or new age music and taking deep breaths while asking yourself questions such as: \"Who do I want to be, regardless of what does or doesn't happen today? Do I want to be a jerk, or a kind soul? Do I want to embody possibility, or show up exuding impossibility?\"An easy meditation game you can play is taking a deep breath, with your eyes closed, each time the train door opens, and exhaling when it closes,\" Jones says.The most important thing, according to Jones, is cultivating a calm, positive mindset before launching into a routine. \"If we can prioritize our wellness in small ways, or create a mindset of possibility before reading a horrible piece of news or a frustrating work email ... that could improve your whole day,\" he says.msmith@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "110"}

{"content": "July 25--As reported previously, you can now see the health inspection scores of restaurants on Yelp.The national rollout of the Local Inspector Value Entry Specification (LIVES) program uses independent company HDScores to glean data from records violations, doling out demerits to restaurants depending on the results of the inspections.Because Chicago does not give out scores or letter grades (as in cities like New York City and Los Angeles), HDScores assigns a number between 1 and 100 to 10,000 restaurants in Chicago that will have this score displayed on their Yelp profiles.More than 600 bots pull data from public records and health inspection reports, and assign scores based on the number of violations and the history of the restaurant, said Andy Phillips, chief technology officer of HDScores. Each week, the bots comb through new data to adjust the scores which are weighted historically. Restaurants with systematically poor records will have a score that reflects that. If a restaurant makes appropriate adjustments, the score will reflect that as well.For example, a restaurant could receive 2 demerits for a critical violation and 1 demerit for a noncritical violation, but if multiple inspections have resulted in the same critical violation, additional demerits will be given. If a violation is corrected on-site, half a demerit point will be subtracted.The scoring is based on each jurisdiction and how it applies the food code, Phillips said. For example, a score of 81 in a city with a more lenient code could be a score of 50 in a city with a stricter one. Typically, it takes about two weeks for the score to update after the inspection has been made public.\"We take our data integrity seriously,\" Phillips said. \"We can't say we're perfect, but we have very low instances of where we've made a mistake. If there's a concern, we ask people to reach out directly, although we won't take complaints against restaurants (from consumers). If there is anything (a restaurant) feels is incorrect, we take it seriously.\"In instances when there have been mistakes, whether it's incorrect data or even a typo, Philips said HDScores has worked with the jurisdiction and the restaurant to rectify it.Additional updates are in the works, so consumers can better understand what the score means. Currently, the format conforms with Yelp's LIVES program, but Phillips said changes may be coming because not all jurisdictions report violations the same way.The company was founded by six people who were concerned with foodborne illnesses and allergies, and some of the founders had children who suffered from sensitivities.\"We had a common concern when you go out to eat in the evening, you're always worried about food contamination,\" said Glynne Townsend, chief marketing officer of HDScores. \"We wanted to try to come up with a way to understand how clean the restaurants were and how well they're operated.\"Yelp executives met HDScores founders at a data event four years ago, and trials began shortly afterward in San Diego County, then the state of Florida a year later before beginning a national rollout in 2016. .The data collected are also provided to insurance companies and other food-reviewing companies, Townsend said. He said he hopes to continue building the database and is looking forward to hearing feedback on the numbers they're assigning. But most of the time, he'll be sending people with questions or complaints about the reason behind the scores to their local health departments.\"This isn't data we're creating,\" Townsend said. \"It's data that has been generated by (users' and restaurants') own health department professionals in the town and the cities.\"Incidentally, Chicago already provides detailed Food Code Rules and information about business inspections online, so consumers can check a restaurant ahead of time to see if a violation was something minor like a leaky hose or more egregious like a rat problem.Before they can operate, restaurants in Chicago have to complete a number of licensing requirements, and once the business is up and running, random visits from the Department of Public Health ensure that it's still operating up to code. While the scores on Yelp only split things into \"critical\" and \"non-critical\" violations, Chicago divides its violations into three categories: critical, serious and minor. These assess whether a restaurant can stay open or if it poses a serious public health risk.Critical violations include inadequate storage temperatures, inappropriate food handling practices, improper personal hygiene, rodent and/or insect infestation or lack of hot running water. If a business fails to correct the issue immediately, it fails the inspection, receives a citation and has its business license suspended. It can only reopen after the Department of Public Health does another inspection.Serious violations include potentially hazardous food improperly thawed, re-serving food previously served to another customer and food not properly protected from contamination during storage, preparation, display, service and transportation. If not immediately corrected, the business fails the inspection but does not have its business license suspended. There will simply be an automatic re-inspection scheduled by the Department of Public Health. However, the inspection could be upgraded to critical if the original violations are not corrected.Minor violations include poorly constructed, unclean or dilapidated walls, ceilings or floors, improper storage of soiled and clean linens, coats and aprons, and unauthorized personnel in the food-prep area. These violations can be upgraded to a serious violation if not corrected before the next inspection.Despite Townsend's claims that the data are neutral, Mike Simmons, chef and owner at Cafe Marie-Jeanne, sees a potentially negative impact on restaurants.\"As a restaurant, you're already required to post your health inspection reports in your restaurant in a place that is visible to all your guests,\" Simmons said. \"It just makes me wonder, is this (because) Yelp has found another way to profit from terrorizing restaurants?\"The city of Chicago already has strict guidelines and restaurants are either compliant or not, Simmons said. If the restaurant is not compliant, it will not be allowed to stay open. A restaurant that is open signifies that the people who run it have spent the time, money and training required to be compliant, he said.\"I'm not sure what Yelp is adding to the conversation,\" Simmons said. \"They've found yet another way to extract the very soul (of a restaurant) and assign a number metric. (It's) one more way for people to give us comments on how bad we're failing the public. It stings to me.\"Yelp has never been there to help restaurants,\" he said. \"Yelp is there to help Yelp.\"Simmons said he isn't sure what the effect of publishing the health scores will be on businesses, but he's concerned that a simple number could turn people away from a restaurant they've been going to for years. He also pointed out that restaurants don't sign up for a Yelp page and that they're even created without their knowledge and consent sometimes. As of press time, Cafe Marie-Jeanne did not have a health score.Calvin Buckner, a manager at Crisp that does have a health score, said he thought the new information was \"weird\" and that he isn't sure if it's helpful to people.He remembered a time when the health department gave the restaurant a $300 fine for having a 1-inch gap in the front door despite everything else on the food side of the restaurant being \"perfect.\"\"Obviously it's a good thing when you want to know how clean a place is that you're eating, but sometimes the health department screws some people over,\" Buckner said. \"I have mixed feelings about it. It's good and bad.\"In response to people who defend the scores on the basis of food allergies, Simmons said they shouldn't try to push responsibility onto restaurants when diners themselves should be paying attention.\"When I hear people saying that, they're trying to defer the responsibility,\" he said. \"We're here to serve food to people, and we're going to take food and provide you with a good time, and we'll bend over backwards to make sure your kids aren't eating food they're allergic to, but it's not our responsibility. It's your responsibility.\"There will be a financial impact from his, Simmons said, which will not only force restaurants to make less money, but also make it harder to pay employees what they should be paid.\"I hate it,\" Simmons said of the numerical rating. \"The more I think about it, the more I hate it. I'm by no means an expert on this new Yelp situation. All I can say is that we will continue to work the way we've always worked, and we'll maintain our own standard, which I find much higher than the city of Chicago. The city of Chicago should be the baseline, and it's already pretty readable in every restaurant you walk into.\"gwong@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "112"}
{"content": "West Virginia football has a large hype machine rolling into the 2018 football season. Can Dana Holgorsen find high major success with the Mountaineers?The West Virginia football program has undergone changes since legendary coach Bobby Bowden arrived in Morgantown, WV in 1970. West Virginia was an independent in those days, and what Bowden used as his stepping stone to the Florida State job after a Peach Bowl victory in 1975. Frank Cignetti took over for Bowden and a downturn followed.In 1980 the country roads aligned as Don Nehlen, a former Bowling Green quarterback, took over the job at West Virginia. Under Coach Nehlen the Mountaineers played in thirteen bowl games and won a total of 149 ball games. The Nehlen era ushered in a move into the Big East conference, a national presence with Heisman Trophy candidate Major Harris, and two 11-1 seasons (1988, 1993).After Coach Nehlen retired Rich Rodriguez was tabbed with the head coaching job. Rodriguez was a former Mountaineers defensive back and had coached in Morgantown in 1985 and 1989. Before taking the head football position at his alma mater, Rodriguez was the offensive coordinator at Clemson. Once running things, Rodriguez replaced Nehlen\u2019s option offense with the famous spread attack that fans remember with quarterbacks like Pat White running a shotgun triple option and run-pass option scheme.Rodriguez\u2019s tenure saw a top-five finish and an 11-1 season as Coach Rod won 60 ballgames from 2001-2007. Once Rodriguez left for Michigan, longtime Mountaineer Bill Stewart was tabbed head coach and finished 9-4 three consecutive years before being replaced by current head coach Dana Holgorsen.Coach Holgorsen has posted a 55-37 record at West Virginia. However, a 2-4 bowl record and stymied success with the move to the Big 12 have put him on the hot seat heading into a hyped up 2018 campaign. The Mountaineers finished 2017 with a 7-6 record and as the 63rd ranked team per the S&amp;P+.Can the Mountaineers answer the hype this season?", "id": "113"}

{"content": "July 29--NAPA -- Conley, Oakland's 2017 first-round pick who only played two games last season because of shin injuries, suffered the injury Friday during a one-on-one drill.\"It's unfortunate. He made a good play on a ball in a one-on-one drill, just bumped his hip a little bit,\" Guenther said. \"He won't be out for too long, but we've got a lot of guys working out there at corner. It's gonna be a good battle to see who comes out of it.\"First-year Raider Daryl Worley has replaced Conley on the first team Saturday and Sunday, with Rashaan Melvin opposite him at cornerback on the first unit.\"He's played a lot football. He's an experienced guy,\" Guenther said of Worley, a 2016 third-round pick of the Panthers. \"He's big and long and he's really starting to pick up the system the last couple days.\"Aside from cornerback news, here are four other things to know from the first day of pads at Raiders training camp.Irvin vs. Miller in padsThe most entertaining battle to watch at the line of scrimmage has been, and will be, veteran defensive end Bruce Irvin vs. rookie left tackle Kolton Miller.Instead of Donald Penn vs. Khalil Mack, we get the 22-year-old 15th overall pick and the 30-year-old Irvin, who's switching to defensive end from linebacker. Sunday presented a first look at the matchup with pads on, and it didn't disappoint.Irvin won the first round by dipping around Miller and reaching the quarterback before the rookie took Round 2. Round 3 was the most even bout between the two, and Irvin likes what he sees from Miller as he fills in for the injured Penn on the starting offensive line.\"He's gonna be good. He's just young. He's a big guy, very athletic, takes coaching,\" Irvin said. \"What else can you ask for in a kid? He's our first-round pick, so he's coming in with a lot of expectations, but he's doing a great job. We battle every day. I tell him, 'Look, we're going to go at it every day. We're in the AFC West. You gotta go against Von. You got Bradley Chubb. You got those dudes in K.C., so we gotta get him ready. We need him, so he's gonna be a really good player.\"Tavecchio perfect in the clutchAt the end of Sunday's practice, the Raiders set up a late-game scenario: Chiefs 16, Raiders 14. Only time for one snap, then a potential game-winning field goal.Derek Carr took the snap and centered the ball before kneeling. Tavecchio lined up for the field goal with a host of defensive players creating a half-circle around him while making noise. Defenders in the game jumped and waved their hands. Fans in the stands were urged to make noise, too.Tavecchio hit his first field goal, then his second in a similar scenario.The incumbent starter figures to be in a tight battle with rookie Eddy Pi\u00f1eiro, the Florida product who the Raiders were surprised didn't get drafted in April. Tavecchio hit 16-of-21 field goals last season and 33-of-34 extra points. He faces the challenge of making the roster when both Pi\u00f1eiro and the Raiders only punter, rookie Johnny Townsend, already have chemistry from their days as Florida teammates.Personnel notes -- With Miller assuming first-team duties at left tackle, fellow rookie Brandon Parker saw reps as the backup left tackle Sunday. He's worked primarily on the right side behind veteran and first-year Raider Breno Giacomini. Second-year tackle David Sharpe served as the No. 2 right tackle on Sunday. -- Undrafted rookie running back Chris Warren joined the three players on the physically unable to perform list (Penn, P.J. Hall and Eddie Vanderdoes) during a pre-practice stretching session separate from the team. The Texas product didn't practice Sunday. -- Running back Jalen Richard exited practice early, and the Las Vegas Review-Journal first reported the injury to be a calf strain. Richard figures to be in a battle with DeAndre Washington for one roster spot with the Raiders adding Doug Martin in free agency to back up Marshawn Lynch. -- The past two days, Oakland's punt return group has consisted of Ryan Switzer, Griff Whalen, Dwayne Harris and Nick Nelson. On Sunday, Switzer and Whalen were the first two on the field followed by Harris and Nelson.Quote of the dayA video circulated on Twitter earlier this week of Mack defending against college kids running routes at the University at Buffalo, his alma mater.Mack locks the kid up and forces him out of bounds while the ball sails nowhere near the receiver.Asked in jest how he thought Mack looked in the video while he holds out amid a contract dispute, Irvin responded:\"I texted him, 'You try to get out there and guard me with them big a** Mack Attack (cleats) on, it ain't going to be good.'\"I talk to him every day. He misses it, but you know how it is. He's working his butt off and when he gets here he'll be ready.\"___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "116"}
{"content": "July 29--The man had fallen, his body twisted, where the alley met the street, on the west side of South Washtenaw Avenue, feet to the north and head to the south.Police officers found him like that in the 300 bock of Washtenaw, in the Near West Side neighborhood, when they responded to a call of shots fired shortly before 11:50 p.m. Saturday.He had been shot in the head and right leg, police said. He was pronounced dead at the scene.To the south of the east-west alley, a large single-story brick building advertised a scrap and salvage business. To its north sat a row of two-story homes, set back from the street by a sidewalk and strip of grass.Police picked up the white papers marking where shell casings had been found, replacing them with numbered yellow markers.A group of three women walked over on Van Buren, approaching from the west. It had been a couple hours since they heard the gunshots, and they still wanted to know had been killed in their neighborhood, they said. While there were new faces from time to time, most of the neighbors at least recognized each other, and some were worried the man might be someone they knew.One of the women said she used to live in the area and was visiting friends nearby. She saw the shell casings marked in the street, and was sure they'd heard more gunshots than that.When they first went to see what had happened, they noticed the man bleeding on the pavement.Seeing the body like that was difficult enough.\"It's even harder to know we don't know his identity,\" the woman said.Now, he was covered by a white sheet. A handful of the markers rested south of the body, while some were scattered north along the block. At least one had landed past the next street, West Gladys Avenue.A few more women joined the group, chatting and watching police for about 10 minutes until they walked away.Officers took the sheet off the man, lifted his arms and pressed his fingers to sheets of white paper. They raised his shirt and shined flashlights on his back. Then they covered him back up.As a large white van drove up to take his body away, the women returned.\"You got a name yet?\" one called out to officers on the other side of the red tape.They didn't. He had yet to be identified early Sunday morning.The man is one of 14 people shot Saturday through early Sunday in Chicago.Most recently, also in the Near West Side, someone inside a dark-colored car shot a 19-year-old man just before 3:45 a.m. while he was standing on the sidewalk in the 200 block of South Ashland Avenue, hitting him in the abdomen. The man was taken to Stroger Hospital and was stable, police said.In other shootings:--Minutes before 3 a.m. in the Lawndale neighborhood, a 16-year-old boy was shot in the left foot while standing on the sidewalk in the 1200 block of South Lawndale Avenue. Two people walked up and fired shots while the boy was with a group, police said.--Just after 2:55 a.m. in the South Side's Woodlawn neighborhood, a 23-year-old man was shot while standing on the back porch of a home in the 6300 block of South Ingleside Avenue. Someone inside a black sedan fired, grazing him in the head, police said. He was taken to University of Chicago Medical Center, where police said he was stable.--Abut 2:30 a.m. in Washington Park, a 24-year-old man was shot in the head while he was walking on the sidewalk in the 200 block of East Garfield Boulevard, police said. He was taken to the University of Chicago Hospital in critical condition.--About 1 a.m. in West Garfield Park, a 26-year-old man standing outside in the 4800 block of West Wilcox was shot multiple times in his body when two people walked up and opened fire, police said.--Shortly before 11:15 p.m. in Woodlawn, a 35-year-old man was shot in the right arm as he sat in the drivers' seat of a parked car in the 1500 block of East 61st Street. The shooter walked up and fired, police said.--Just after 9:35 p.m. in South Shore, an 18-year-old man with gunshot wounds to his back and shoulder was found in the 6700 block of South East End. He was taken to University of Chicago Hospital in good condition, police said.--Just before 9:40 p.m. in Jackson Park Highlands, an 18-year-old man who had been shot in the wrist was found walking in the 7000 block of South Jeffery Boulevard after he was inside a silver SUV that crashed into a sidewalk, police said. He was taken to University of Chicago Hospital and was stable but would not say more about what had happened, police said.--About 8:50 p.m. in Roseland, a 26-year-old man was shot in the left leg and groin area while standing on the sidewalk in the 11100 block of South Union Avenue. He has been stabilized at a hospital, police said.--About 6:45 p.m. in Park Manor, after a call of shots fired, officers found a 19-year-old man on the sidewalk with gunshot wounds in his abdomen and back. He was taken to University of Chicago Medical Center, where he was in serious condition, police said.--Just after 1:30 p.m. in West Englewood, a 25-year-old man standing on the street in the 7100 block of South Hermitage Avenue was shot in the chest by someone who got out of a black vehicle and fired, police said. He was taken to Advocate Christ Medical Center in critical condition.--An 18-year-old man and 13-year-old boy were both wounded in a shooting in the South Austin neighborhood late Saturday morning on the West Side. They were in the 4900 block of West Cortez Street at 11:55 a.m. when someone came up to them and starting shooting, according to the Chicago Police Department. The man was hit in the lower back and buttocks, and the boy was also hit in the buttocks. They were both taken to Stroger Hospital in good condition, police said.___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "117"}
{"content": "Sprint's quarter was a yawn. For Sprint's (S)   fiscal first quarter results, customer growth was a silver lining as profit declined year over year as the telecommunications company reported its results before Wednesday's opening bell. The company did report higher than expected revenues, including growth in wireless revenue for the first time in four years. Earnings per share fell to four cents on $176 million net profit from five cents on $206 million net profit a year ago, but above analyst's estimates of two cents a share, according to a FactSet broker survey. Total net operating revenue of $8.13 billion was down from $8.16 billion a year ago, but above FactSet's estimates for $8.06 billion. Sprint added 87,000 new monthly bill paying cellular customers, an increase over the 55,000 added in the previous quarter, according to the earnings release. Operating income was $815 million in the quarter, marking the 10th consecutive quarter of positive earnings, but down year over year from the first quarter of 2017 when operating income totaled $1.2 billion.  \"By balancing growth and profitability, we were able to grow wireless service revenue sequentially, continue to add retail phone customers, generate net income for the third consecutive quarter, and improve the network,\" said Sprint CEO Michel Combes in a statement. Shares of Sprint were lower in afternoon trading. Jefferies analyst Scott Goldman issued a price target for the stock of $5.50 on Wednesday, noting better sales of handsets, sequential growth from quarter to quarter in revenue, and 15 % growth in adjusted EBITDA. The company's $3.3 billion in adjusted EBITDA was its highest total in 11 years. Sprint saw Wireless Service revenues grow for the first time sequentially in four years to $5.7 billion for the period, compared to $5.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017. J.P. Morgan analyst Philip Cusick wrote Wednesday that higher subscriber additions were a bright spot, but worried about the company raising prices from a deeply discounted level and losing customers. Cusick did not rate the stock. \"What has been the reaction and how much remains of pricing up the base?\" Cusick wrote. \"Can the company get to the $6 billion or higher level in 2019?\" Sprint, the country's fourth largest wireless carrier is in the midst of a $26 billion merger with T-Mobile US (TMUS) , the nation's third largest wireless carrier, a deal that must win approval from the Federal Trade Commission.

{"content": "July 26--White Sox catcher Omar Narvaez had to grin when asked how effective left-handed starter Carlos Rodon was Tuesday night in the 4-2 victory over the Angels.\"From the very beginning?\" Narvaez said before the Sox resumed the series Wednesday night. \"He couldn't throw a strike in the bullpen before the game.\"Rodon threw strike after strike during the game, however, as he took a no-hitter into the sixth inning. Rodon frequently got ahead in the count and did not allow anyone to get too comfortable against a fastball that topped out at 95 mph and breaking balls that dipped at the knees. He made pitching look like the easiest task in sports.Rodon got the first two outs of the game, walked Mike Trout and then retired 15 straight batters, many on ground balls. The string was broken when David Fletcher drew a two-out walk in the sixth.Andrelton Simmons then broke up Rodon's no-hitter with a bouncer up the middle, but Sox third baseman Yolmer Sanchez made a nice defensive play to end the inning, popping up after taking a throw from the outfield and catching Simmons taking too wide of a turn around first.Rodon worked a clean seventh, then gave up a leadoff double to Ian Kinsler in the eighth. Rodon got two more outs before a walk ended his night with two hits and three walks allowed in 7 2/3 innings.\"He was pitching very free and easy,\" manager Rick Renteria said afterward. \"He went deep into the game and had a good mix of pitches. He stayed efficient as the game went on before getting a little tired.\"Said Rodon: \"It was fun. There were a lot of balls hit at guys and they got me into the eighth. I was in a groove early. The no-hitter was in my head, but I got a fastball out against Simmons.\"Narvaez wasn't concerned after the errant warmup.\"That's the way it works sometimes,\" he said. \"He got ahead of hitters all night. He pretty much did whatever he wanted to do.\"Rodon has put together three straight quality starts, allowing just 10 hits in 21 innings with a 1.71 ERA and .141 opponents average. This is the Rodon the Sox remember from his first two seasons, when he went 18-16 with an ERA below four before injuries took their toll in 2017.He was shut down early in '17 with bursitis in his left biceps and inflammation in his left shoulder. Rodon returned and made 12 starts before the shoulder inflammation returned and he was shut down again. He had offseason shoulder surgery and missed the first two months of 2018 while rehabilitating his shoulder.The last three starts are indicative of Rodon's overall talent, and they have come at the same time Lucas Giolito has had back-to-back solid outings and improved efforts were delivered by Reynaldo Lopez and Dylan Covey as well.The members of that quartet are all 26 or younger and represent a large part of the hopes for the Sox in 2019 and beyond. For the moment at least Rodon and Co. seem to be renewing hopes for a late surge this season.Pitching for sale: The Sox were very active last season at the trade deadline. This year, they aren't expected to seek out any large trades, but four veteran pitchers likely are available as teams in pennant races look to fill a rotation or find bullpen help.James Shields, who started Wednesday night against the Angels, has pitched better than his 4-11 record indicates, and the 36-year-old could fill a fourth or fifth rotation spot on a contender.There's more trade talk about relievers, and the Sox have three who could be moved for prospects. Joakim Soria, 34, has 16 saves in 19 opportunities this season and hasn't allowed a run in 21 of his last 22 appearances. He had saves in both victories over the Angels this week and has a career ERA of 2.86.Jeanmar Gomez and Xavier Cedeno, both 30, could fill key roles in a pennant race and losing either wouldn't have a major impact on the Sox because many pitching prospects are performing well in the minors.Several teams are looking for bullpen help, including the Cubs and Dodgers. The Dodgers have lacked a bridge to Kenley Jansen all season and a one-inning semi-closer such as Soria could be that filler.Bob Keisser is a freelance reporter for the Chicago Tribune.___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "119"}
{"content": "July 26--Apple's long, litigious and messy fight with Qualcomm may have reached its climax on Wednesday, as Qualcomm's chief financial officer announced during an earnings call that Apple will no longer use its modems for future iPhones.The Apple-Qualcomm fight centered on Apple's displeasure at forking over as much as $30 in royalties to Qualcomm for every iPhone sold. Apple soon began working with Intel to develop new modems -- some of which were used in iPhone 7 -- starting in 2015. In January last year, Apple sued Qualcomm, alleging the royalties amounted to extortion, and stopped paying the royalties.A year and a half later, Qualcomm seemed to have given up on Apple.\"We believe Apple intends to solely use our competitor's modems rather than our modems in its next iPhone release,\" said Davis, according to CNET.Another Qualcomm executive said during the earnings call, \"If the opportunity presents itself,\" Qualcomm will become Apple's supplier once again, according to CNET.Apple's break from Qualcomm, however, may mean slower iPhones compared to its Android counterparts, as phones using Qualcomm chips outperformed phones using its competitors, according to a recent study. Apple will be switching its iPhone 4G modems from Qualcomm to Intel, according to CNET.In a study published this week by Ookla, a Seattle-based internet testing and analysis company, Android phones powered by Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 845 ran significantly faster than non-Android phones powered by Intel's XMM 7480 and 7360 chips on various cellular carriers. The study ran more than 1 million internet speed tests to reduce possible bias, according to ZDNet.In AT&amp;T and T-Mobile phones, Android phones with Qualcomm chips downloaded data at least 60 percent faster and uploaded data at least 20 percent faster than its non-Android counterparts.Qualcomm said in a press release Ookla's test proved that \"real-world data supports Qualcomm Technologies' claims of superior wireless performance.\"In a countersuit by Qualcomm against Apple in April last year, Qualcomm alleged that Apple throttled data speeds in iPhone 7 models with Qualcomm chips to match the slower iPhones with Intel chips.Qualcomm alleged Apple \"chose not to utilize certain high-performance features of the Qualcomm chipsets for the iPhone 7\" and that Apple \"falsely claimed that there was 'no discernible difference' between iPhones with Qualcomm's chipsets and iPhones with Intel's chipsets\" even when the Qualcomm-powered iPhones nonetheless outperformed the Intel-powered counterparts.___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "120"}
{"content": "July 26--Chances are you've owned or ridden in a Toyota Corolla. Maybe you've forgotten. The world's best-selling car has done a historic job of blending in. That's not the case with the 2019 Toyota Corolla hatchback. Especially in Blue Flame.Missing this paint job would be like missing a rainbow. It's bright and arresting, and the return of the hatchback to the Corolla family comes at the perfect time in a world awash in crossovers.Toyota had a similar hatch last year in the Corolla iM, but that was a vestige of the discontinued Scion brand. The 2019 Corolla hatchback is all new and reflective of Toyota's makeover from boring appliance cars to something -- edgier, if not sexier. And it comes loaded with standard technology to appeal to that youthful demographic or to boomers who have come to rely on Toyota's reliable quality.Toyota's bold X-wing grille, with squinting eyes and a gaping mouth, looks good. On larger vehicles it seems to be something it is not: sporty. The hatch rides low, and with wheels pushed to the edges it looks much better than its taller sibling, the compact crossover.The tester came in Toyota's sportiest XSE trim, with 18-inch alloy wheels and a front-wheel-drive powertrain that is not quite as sporty as it looks. The 168-horsepower four-cylinder engine could use a boost from a turbocharger, which is something Toyota has avoided while the rest of the industry adopts turbo fours. The horsepower is competitive, but the 151 pound-feet of torque lags top-trim segment leaders such as the Volkswagen Golf and Honda Civic.Brace yourself -- Toyota also uses a CVT, which has never not once been known for sport. But this is no ordinary CVT. It essentially has a first launch gear you can hammer up to about 20 mph before it moves to the bands and pulley of the CVT. This \"dynamic-shift CVT\" then has a 10-speed, umm, simulator that can be drawn out for higher revs with small paddle shifters. A sport mode also enhances more urgent driving. It does not drone like other CVTs. It would have been fun to test the six-speed manual ($1,100 less), but the vast majority will opt for the CVT.It's not fast, but it's not dull. And we averaged 33 mpg. The handling was pleasantly surprising. It can be pushed, and the uncluttered design of the cabin puts the driver in a pushing state of mind.The interior is where the XSE stands out. The light gray and black trim pieces soften the sharp blue exterior, and the climate controls are one narrow line of buttons. The 8-inch touch screen is embedded like an iPad in the dash, but it has a volume and tuner knob and a super clear backup camera. The steering wheel controls and 7-inch display in the instrument cluster let you avoid the touch screen for the most part.Toyota Safety Sense comes standard. The suite of advanced driver assistance systems such as adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking and lane keep assist would cost anywhere from $1,000 to $2,000 from other automakers.It includes all the dings, pings and zings for free as well. If you go over the speed limit, you get a ding. If your passengers don't buckle up, ping. If you leave hands off the wheel long enough, zing.For about 15 seconds, the car will drive itself as long as it can read lines in the road. The tech does a pretty good job, though at one point over a bridge it swayed far to one side of the lane, then far to the other before righting itself. In construction with zagging lanes, we were more comfortable having hands on the wheel, which is pretty common for such advanced driver assistance systems. Otherwise TSS works really well and you can't beat the price.If only Toyota invested as much in its outdated, frustrating Entune infotainment system. It's one of the worst systems on the market; try using the voice commands to \"Call Akio Toyoda\" and tell him to scrap it, and it'll show a list of three-digit numbers to call for any contact. The layout is cramped even on full screen mode; the buttons flanking the larger screen feel like something on a dollar store toy. Hate Entune. But it finally comes with Apple CarPlay, which is a relief.There's not much to hate about the Corolla hatchback. The front is spacious, the rear seats fit two teens without complaint, and we were able to fit four carry-ons in the back. There are sportier hatches such as the Volkswagen Golf, Mazda3, Hyundai Elantra GT and Honda Civic, but the Corolla undercuts them on price with a loaded package. It's enough to stand out amid crossovers, hatchbacks and fading memories alike.2019 Toyota Corolla Hatchback XSEVehicle type: HatchbackBase price: $19,990 (SE trim)As tested: $24,090 (excluding $920 destination)Mpg: 30 city, 38 highwayEngine: 168-horsepower 2-liter four-cylinderTransmission: Dynamic-shift CVTParting shot: Value play with Civic, Golf, and Mazda3rduffer@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "121"}

The tablets, which are supplied by contract with CenturyLink and JPay, do not allow internet access.Family and friends can use JPay to transfer funds to inmates to use as credits for the JPay system. JPay and CenturyLink say the prisoners exploited a software vulnerability to bump up their credit balances.CenturyLink spokesperson Mark Mozen said the vulnerability has been resolved, but the company won\u2019t provide details it considers proprietary information.In a prepared statement, JPay spokesperson Jade Trombetta said, \u201cJPay is proud to provide services that allow incarcerated individuals to communicate with friends and family, access educational programming, and enjoy positive entertainment options that help prevent behavioral issues.\u201d\u201cWhile the vast majority of individuals use our secure technology appropriately,\u201d Trombetta continued, \u201cwe are continually working to improve our products to prevent any attempts at misuse.\u201dFifty of the 364 miscreants accumulated more than $1,000 in credits, said Idaho Department of Corrections spokesperson Jeff Ray. One inmate had almost $10,000 in hacked credits.Ray said a special investigations unit discovered the problem earlier this month. Ray also stated that no taxpayer dollars were involved in the thefts.\u201cThis conduct was intentional, not accidental. It required a knowledge of the JPay system and multiple actions by every inmate who exploited the system\u2019s vulnerability to improperly credit their account,\u201d Ray said in a prepared statement reported by the AP.Inmates involved in the hacking activity can still send and receive emails, but otherwise, their ability to download games and music has been cut off until they make good on the thefts. To date, JPay has recovered more than $65,000 in credits.The Department of Corrections filed disciplinary offense reports for the alleged hackers. The inmates could potentially lose prison privileges and be reclassified to higher risk levels.Prisons in the United States have four major purposes: retribution, incapacitation, deterrence, and rehabilitation. Education is an essential element of inmate rehabilitation, but teaching prisoners how to hack computer systems was never part of the plan.", "id": "122"}
{"content": "Aug. 02--NAPA -- It may have been because Rodney Hudson had correctly aligned his teammates on the offensive line to pick up a blitz designed by defensive coordinator Paul Guenther.Or that Gruden was jazzed because Hudson was doing what he always does, running downfield on the off chance he can throw a block to spring a running back or receiver for additional yardage.Hudson wasn't saying. He seldom does.\"I don't know, Hudson said. \"We're just playing ball.\"Which is, of course, why Gruden is so enamored with a man he's already dubbed the best center he's ever coached. Hudson, a Pro Bowl performer in each of the last two years, is the definition of low maintenance.Hudson practices every day, and either legitimately loves it or has convinced himself that training camp drudgery is fun and games. When Hudson takes the podium or talks with the media one-on-one, there is no fear that he'll step into controversy.He has started all 32 games over the last two seasons, even playing through a kidney stone last season. The only games Hudson missed were three in 2014, his first season with the Raiders, because of an ankle injury.Given Hudson's durability, go ahead and assume it was a significant injury.Gruden even compared Hudson to the indestructible franchise standard for the center position.\"Jim Otto was here for the alumni (weekend) and I was talking to him about Rodney,\" Gruden said. \"There is a lot of similarities in terms of toughness and passion for football, communication and all-out effort.\"Communication, in the form of relaying blocking assignments and being simpatico with quarterback Derek Carr, is one of Hudson's best qualities. It's a quality that doesn't exist with the media, where Hudson is agreeable and friendly but very good at keeping specifics out of the conversation.Yes, Hudson said he's talked with Otto, but he's keeping the details to himself.Gruden throws a lot at an offense, his quarterback and center in particular. Both Carr and Hudson have so far have kept up the pace. He has to keep track of not only the myriad calls of Gruden's offense, but the varied schemes of Guenther's defense.\"I think for me, I have to really lock in and anticipate and even after I anticipate I have to trust what I see,\"Hudson said. \"The scheme of this defense is known to be multiple and do a lot of things. Mentally, I have to make sure I'm locked in.\"Since arriving as general manager Reggie McKenzie's first big free agent strike in 2014 (five years, $44.5 million), Hudson has not only met but exceeded some high expectations.\"When you're in the pivot and playing against Guenther, a lot of things change,\" Gruden said. \"Looks like they're bringing a blitz to the left, then they bring a blitz to the right. They're coming up the middle. He made a couple of calls late in the down that were awesome.\"It's going to be fun with the battery we have. Derek Carr and Rodney Hudson are showing some really good communication and understanding of our system.\"Jerry Rice was known for taking even routine practice snaps to the end zone. Hudson is similar, only his goal is to help someone else get there. It's something he's done since his college days at Florida State.\"The thing I love about Hudson is when we throw a pass, he runs down to see if the receiver needs any help every play,\" Gruden said. \"He's the best center I've ever coached.\"Hudson is like his coach in that there is no place he'd rather be than the practice field.\"Right now it's early (in camp),\" Hudson said. \"It becomes a grind, but for me the love of the game always rises to the top, no matter how tired I am. When times get hard, I love being out here with my teammates.\"___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "123"}

The right-hander posted a 3.16 ERA over 31 1/3 innings this season with the A's this season before getting designated for assignment just before the All-Star break.The decision to let Casilla go was a tough one for A's manager Bob Melvin. He enjoyed having the 15-year big league veteran around, who was a resource for the younger pitchers with his impressive resume that included three world series titles with the San Francisco Giants.\"We all wanted him to get a job and we all think very fondly of him. He's had a heck of a career,\" Melvin said. \"When we made the move, we knew there was still more left with him.\"The A's will head to Coors Field for the start of a three-game series against the Rockies Friday night, though it's unlikely Casilla would join the team by that time. The Rockies could use some bullpen help. They find themselves in the middle of a playoff race in the NL West, just 1 1/2 games back of first place despite holding the league's worst bullpen ERA at 5.26.\"Hopefully he'll find a few days to get himself right for Triple-A,\" Melvin said .\"Then when we leave, he can come back up.\"___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "124"}

Brewers reliever Josh Hader was the first, and after some of his old tweets surfaced during the All-Star game he was ordered by MLB to undergo sensitivity training.

{"content": "July 31--From his windows up high in a Hyde Park retirement home, Eugene Parker can see, fittingly, the great mass of the Museum of Science and Industry and the distinctive rooftops of the University of Chicago.He also can watch the sun as it rises over the lake and sets in the west, which is even more fitting because as much as any human alive, Parker is responsible for our understanding of the star that keeps us alive.As a young U. of C. scientist in the mid-1950s, he performed some calculations and realized there must be a \"solar wind\" -- his term -- propelling material outward from the sun and affecting the entire solar system. The astronomical community scoffed at this upstart insight, and then, within a few years, early space missions proved it true.As a 91-year-old emeritus professor in 2018, he will be at Cape Canaveral next month to watch NASA launch its Parker Solar Probe, the agency's first mission named for a living person.NASA broke protocol, said Thomas Zurbuchen, head of the agency's Science Mission Directorate, because of \"the unique impact Parker has had in the entire portfolio. We have 107 missions ongoing right now,\" either in operation or in planning. \"Thirty-five of them are directly related to Parker's work.\"\"It's wonderful,\" said Nicola Fox, project scientist for the solar probe, which will bring science far closer to the sun than it's ever been. \"He's going to stand and he's going to watch his legacy mission leave the planet and start its journey.\"He is the father of the mission. It was his paper. It was his science. It was his discovery that led to science's knowing the (sun's) corona was such an interesting place to go visit, and it's taken 60 years to be able to do this daring plunge into the sun's atmosphere.\"Parker, though, isn't much for the fanfare.In the home he and his wife share, an end table carried about the only visible sign of his fame, a stack of coaster-sized Parker Solar Probe stickers.\"A Mission to Touch the Sun,\" they say, the words atop an image of a spacecraft against a fiery orange inferno.\"Take one,\" Parker encouraged visitors late last week.\"I'm greatly honored that they would put my name on it,\" he said. \"But I contributed nothing to the spacecraft. That's the hard work of a lot of other guys who never get much credit. They don't get interviews from the newspapers.\"But to be the first living honoree, following missions named for the likes of Kepler, Galileo, Hubble?\"I tend to shrug my shoulders at that,\" he said. \"The fact that I'm living seems neither here nor there because I have not contributed in any way to the building of that spacecraft.\"He is more focused on what the probe will learn on its seven-year mission as it loops repeatedly around Venus to propel it through the sun's atmosphere. Among the key questions being explored: How is the sun, contrary to any phenomenon on Earth, so many magnitudes hotter in its corona, the surrounding area visible in an eclipse (1.7 million degrees Fahrenheit and up), than at its surface (about 10,000 degrees), and how does it expel matter at supersonic speeds?The sun, Parker said a couple of times, is a \"very ordinary star.\" What we learn about it will tell us, in all likelihood, about much of the universe, although the craft's closest approach, at about 4 million miles and 2,500 degrees, won't come until 2024.\"Investigating the mechanisms of the heating are what I get most excited about,\" he said.That sounds a lot like the Gene Parker she has come to know, said Fox, who will take part with the professor in a press event at the university's Gleacher Center downtown on Tuesday to draw attention to the scientist and the upcoming mission, now targeted to launch in the early morning hours of Aug. 11.\"It's like meeting Brad Pitt or somebody,\" she said. \"He discovered the solar wind. He's kind of the father of heliophysics. ... He's this mythical person that did all this unbelievable science, and then you meet him, and he's just a lovely man.\"In October Parker visited the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University, where Fox is chief scientist for heliophysics and where the Parker Solar Probe was being loaded with an array of instruments that may solve some of the sun's enduring mysteries.Again, she said, he was humble in the face of the engineering.\"I took him to meet the spacecraft that bears his name,\" she said.Photographs of that event show Parker standing in the white suit required in a \"clean room,\" peering into the innards of the craft, and standing beside the exterior clad in the almost 5 inches of carbon that will keep it from incinerating as it flies past the sun.Parker, she recalled, kept saying, \"'You guys are the really clever ones. I just solved some equations. ... I just wrote a paper.' \"\"I was like, 'Yeah, it's a pretty good paper, Gene.' \"\"Dynamics of the Interplanetary Gas and Magnetic Fields\" started on page 664 of volume 128 of the Astrophysical Journal, published in November, 1958.\"We consider the dynamical consequences of Biermann's suggestion that gas is often streaming outward in all directions from the sun with velocities on the order of 500-1500 km/sec,\" begins the paper's abstract.They don't sound like the first words in a revolution, but those, and the words and calculations that followed, proved profound.\"People expected the space between earth and the sun to be basically a void,\" said Angela Olinto, a U. of C. astronomer and the university's dean of physical sciences. \"Solar wind sort of connects up to the sun and all the other planets of the sun. Our local neighborhood is really quite different than the one we thought of in the 1950s.\"\"One of the reasons why Parker is so revered is because he was comfortable with a topic that most found arcane, difficult,\" said Geza Gyuk, director of astronomy at the Adler Planetarium.The son of an engineer and grandson of a physicist, Parker, who grew up in the Buffalo and Detroit areas, was able to see the sun differently than those who had studied it before, he said, because he didn't approach it with a traditional astronomy background. Trained at Michigan State and CalTech, he was a physics guy so he tended to think in terms of systems, he said, where astronomers thought more about discrete objects.A key to his work was the German scientist Ludwig Biermann's theory about why comet tails always point away from the sun, no matter the comet's direction of travel. Biermann suggested the sun must be emitting a stream of material, dubbed \"solar corpuscular radiation,\" but did not explain the reason for the existence of such material.And the British scientist Sydney Chapman had shown that the sun's corona extended beyond Earth, Parker said, but Chapman thought of the corona as a static thing.When you add in Biermann's idea of motion, \"you get an equation with one more term in it,\" Parker said. \"And when you solve that, that makes all the difference in the world.\"He looked at it as a problem similar to hydrodynamics -- the flow of water -- and found \"there's only one solution that fits,\" he said. \"That's the supersonic solar winds starting slow and dense and accelerating as you go out\" away from the sun.\"You put that into the mathematics, and the mathematics says, 'Well, there you are,' \" he said.Here is NASA's layperson's explanation of solar wind, from the detailed website for the Parker Solar Probe: \"In the 1950s, Parker proposed a number of concepts about how stars -- including our Sun -- give off energy. He called this cascade of energy the solar wind, and he described an entire complex system of plasmas, magnetic fields, and energetic particles that make up this phenomenon.\"But eminent astronomers in 1958 disagreed. Two of them were given the paper for peer review, and both rejected it. Their message was essentially that Parker couldn't be right because his work disagreed with conventional thinking.\"We recommend that the author go to the library and read up on the subject before he attempts to write papers about it,\" Parker recalled one of the scientist's critiques saying.But there was no \"real criticism,\" just a declaration and so Parker persisted: \"I've had people say, 'Well, weren't you worried that if everybody disagreed, you might be wrong?' My reply is, 'I'm working with Newton. Newton got it right.' \"The journal's editor Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, a Chicago astronomer and future Nobel laureate in physics, examined the paper and told Parker he could find nothing wrong with it and he would publish it.There was very little reaction, Parker said, but the 1962 Mariner 2 robotic voyage to Venus confirmed the solar wind's existence.Parker continued on the faculty full time through 1995, had a major hand in guiding the university's astronomical research, colleagues said, and published important papers regularly on topics including the solar magnetic field and a theory on how the sun's corona is heated.He won honors including the National Medal of Science, in 1989, and the Kyoto Prize for Lifetime Achievements in Basic Science, in 2003, but not the Nobel.His theory on the lack of recognition from Sweden? \"It wasn't exotic,\" he said of his solar wind work. \"In a way I sort of feel, that just shows how much smarter you have to be to see it -- because none of you guys thought of it. But anyway, I can't complain. I've gotten by all right.\"Gyuk, of the Adler, thinks there may be a Nobel nomination in the offing \"if his suggestions on heating mechanisms in the solar wind come to boot\" as data comes in from the Parker Solar Probe.But NASA naming the mission after him last year, no matter how much Parker might demur, represents a kind of crowning honor. It becomes doubly true when you consider how the mission will end: with the craft losing propellant and thus its ability to protect itself from the sun, vaporizing in the heat and joining the solar wind.sajohnson@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "126"}

{"content": "In the last three months, Facebook\u2019s usually steep user growth didn\u2019t change at all in the U.S. and fell in Europe following new data privacy laws. But during a second-quarter earnings report on Wednesday, July 25,  the social media giant shared a new number \u2014 there are 2.5 billion people using a Facebook-owned app, which also includes Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, each month. The metric doesn\u2019t double count users on multiple apps, such as people that are on both Facebook and Instagram.The network shared the statistic for the first time this week during a report that posted slower revenue growth than anticipated while the company\u2019s costs continue to jump. This year, the company has faced its largest privacy scandal yet while simultaneously working to make sure time on Facebook is \u201ctime well spent\u201d and buckling down to combat abuse. Facebook expected that those changes would impact user counts and revenue, and true to the company\u2019s predictions, both slowed during the second quarter of 2018.Facebook\u2019s newest statistic feels even more impressive considering 3 billion of the 4 billion world internet users are on social media. That means the company has the attention of more than 80 percent of social media users worldwide.Facebook users now total 1.47 billion \u2014 that is still a growth over 2017, but the 11 percent growth is the slowest user growth that the network has seen since 2011. That\u2019s also lower than last quarter\u2019s growth after the Cambridge Analytica prompted a #deletefacebook hashtag. Facebook says the growth was driven by users in India, Indonesia, and the Philippines. Growth in the U.S. and Canada remained flat at about 185 million users. After the new General Data Protection Regulation privacy laws went into effect earlier this year, the user count in Europe fell by a million monthly active users. Despite those changes, Facebook says that a majority of users opted to allow the network to continue ad targeting to see more relevant ads at the cost of sharing data.While Facebook predicted a slowdown when CEO Mark Zuckerberg called for the platform to make time spent on Facebook time well spent, Wall Street was more surprised by the results, with the company falling short of expectations and stock dropping by 20 percent as a result. Revenue decelerated by seven percent and the company predicts a similar \u201chigh single digit\u201d rate throughout the remainder of 2018. Ad revenue, however, grew by 42 percent over 2017, with mobile ads now taking up 91 percent of the overall ad revenue.At the same time, the company\u2019s costs have increased by about 50 percent, with staff growing by 47 percent. That investment is largely for security as Facebook expands review staff. The network says that despite the investment in security, the network doesn\u2019t plan on slowing the investment into developing new features.The latest numbers may be bad news for investors, but Zuckerberg shared several changes implemented over the last few months designed both to curb abuse and to create less passive content consumption. The platform\u2019s artificial intelligence for detecting graphic violence, for example, now catches 90 percent of the violence removed from the network. The network now has two new tools for ad transparency and has stepped up the fight against fake news by pushing known misinformation further down in the feed.", "id": "128"}
{"content": "It\u2019s the disease that\u2019s in the news almost daily. Almost everyone in the country knows someone or has been affected by it and doctors have no known cure. This scary proposition sounds right out of a horror film but it\u2019s all too real. Depression is an all too common disease that affects over 300 million people around the globe according to the World Health Organization.If you suspect that you\u2019re suffering from the disease, you may think that you can just hop online, check your symptoms, and find a way to get better\u2013wrong. Not all people deal with the disease the same way or even the right way. There are all sorts of remedies like meditation, therapy, and a change in behavior. The true answer is that it\u2019s a combination of solutions that will help to ease the disease.     In the meantime, if you\u2019re researching how to deal with the disease, you\u2019ve found the right place. Here are 7 things that I wish I had known about depression:Sadness Is Not What You ThinkSadness isn\u2019t always a symptom of the disease. It can appear in some but not others. So how do you know when you\u2019re experiencing sadness and not the disease itself? Sadness is a completely normal human emotion\u2013everyone experiences sadness. The disease of being depressed, however, is a completely different animal.     Sadness in those that are are trying to deal with depression is pervasive, constant, and life affecting\u2013it\u2019s an abnormal reaction to external stimuli. Things that don\u2019t normally trigger sadness will now ruin your entire day. It\u2019s an emotion that will sap the energy from all other emotions.Physical PainIt\u2019s not just a mental disease, but a highly physical one as well. The daily toll that grinds down on your body will leave you fatigued and cause you physical pain. Chest palpitations, aching muscles, and a constant desire to sleep are symptoms found in many sufferers.It\u2019s ironic, however, that a common way to treat depression is through exercise. Your body and mind will be screaming \u201cNO!\u201d The disease tells your mind that you won\u2019t get better and it tricks the body into thinking the same.     It\u2019s Not A ChoiceNobody chooses to be depressed. If you\u2019re experiencing the disease, you will know that that phrase rings with truth. Often, people may come up to you after hearing of your diagnosis and say, \u201cSnap out of it,\u201d or \u201cOh yeah, I had that.\u201d They\u2019ll offer up unsolicited advice and counsel that can actually do more damage.The worst part about the disease is that it grows and expands across your brain and thoughts. It shows you a path filled with dark and dreary but it is a well laid out map. You can\u2019t just will your way out of the disease. It will take a concerted effort to fight your way out of the depths. The hard part is not depression, it\u2019s getting away from it.Anxiety is Your New Best FriendAnxiety doesn\u2019t always go along with depression but if you are suffering, the chances of being impacted by anxiety rise by 60-70%. A 70 percent chance is good odds in Vegas but with your mental health, it\u2019s terrifying.Everything will stress you out and may be a trigger leading to a horrible day. A flippant comment from someone on the street may have you reaching for the covers and pulling them tightly over your head as you curl into a little ball. You\u2019ll replay the incident over and over until you no longer want to get out because the stressors of anxiety will be too much to bear.Suicidal TendenciesMany think that suicide is a universal symptom of the disease\u2013it\u2019s not, by the way. Sufferers of the disease may never even think about suicide. Some may just think about death or disappearing from the world. If these manifest into thoughts of suicide, you should seek help immediately.Suicide is never the answer. Help is available even if it doesn\u2019t seem like it now. According to studies, 8 out of 10 people that consider suicide will let their intentions be known. If you are experiencing or know someone who is experiencing these intentions, please call a suicide hotline.The Disease is SneakyYou could be having a great day and then \u201cBoom!\u201d something is triggered and you\u2019re deep into your head again. It sneaks up on you when you least expect it and at the most inopportune times.You won\u2019t even know you have the disease, at first. It starts as a tiny, little seed. Each passing day things may cause that seed to grow and grow and grow until it\u2019s fully mature. At this point, it\u2019s difficult to get rid of and there was nothing you could do to prevent it.You Are Not AloneBeing depressed can leave you isolated and withdrawn from the world. Going out for drinks, shopping for groceries, or seeing a movie at the theater may feel like a chore. You\u2019ll stop talking as much with friends and family and you\u2019ll wonder where everyone went.They didn\u2019t go anywhere; they\u2019re still there. They also might not understand what you\u2019re going through. This only compounds matters because if you were to lash out or avoid these people in your life altogether, they may even come to resent you. All this piles up into the feeling of loneliness and abandonment that is difficult to get over.Realize that you\u2019re not alone. According to the ADAA, depression affects 6.7% of the population, or 16 million adults. Chances are that at least a few people in your life have experienced or are experiencing the stresses of the disease.Don\u2019t give up. It may seem like the easy thing to do but to deal with depression, it takes a monumental effort on your behalf. Friends and family may not be the ones to get you that assistance. Sometimes, the first step is identifying the issue and then seeking treatment. One thing is for certain\u2013it does get better. It may not seem like it now but it truly does and when you emerge from the depths of the disease, you will be a whole new person\u2013tougher and stronger, with eyes wide open.", "id": "129"}
{"content": "July 29--The White Sox on Saturday night drew their best crowd since opening day.Perhaps the 29,442 fans came because of the Iron Man bobblehead giveaway. Maybe it was the promise of postgame fireworks, the ideal mid-70s temps or the fact that the Sox had been playing better of late -- six victories in their last 12 games. (Baby steps.)The real fireworks won't come until Michael Kopech and Eloy Jimenez reach Chicago, but the crowd was rewarded with a sweet rally after the Sox trailed 4-0 after three innings and 5-1 heading into the seventh-inning stretch.\"The boys gave them a show,\" manager Rick Renteria said. \"They've gone through the ups and downs with us. They love this team and we want to give them something to cheer about.\"That they did.The South Siders pulled out a 9-5 victory thanks to a six-run eighth inning -- their most productive inning of the season. And they did all that damage before the Blue Jays recorded a second out.The big moments: Jose Abreu doubled. Daniel Palka came through with a bases-loaded single to right. Leury Garcia cleared the bases with a triple. In between, both Nicky Delmonico and catcher Kevan Smith got hit by pitches.\"It was an electric moment,\" Garcia said. \"One of the keys for us was the feel of the crowd.\"News flash: Maybe it wasn't the best idea for the Blue Jays to start John Axford, a career relief pitcher. Axford did not allow a run in his first big-league start, but he lasted just three innings.Ryan Tepera was the Jays' sixth pitcher of the night, and he was hopeless.The Sox's bullpen, meanwhile, produced 42/3 innings of scoreless ball.The only bummer for the Sox was the performance of Lucas Giolito, who had provided recent hope that he had turned the corner and would pitch more like a former phenom and less like the wildest pitcher in the American League. (Tyler Chatwood's 85 walks in 94 innings is hard to top.)But Giolito had a brutal time of it Saturday, from the first batter he faced (Curtis Granderson singled) to the last (Yangervis Solarte singled).\"I thought I threw the ball well,\" Giolito said. But I was getting too much of the plate with my heater, especially with two strikes. And maybe pitch selection (was lacking) throughout the game. I could have done a better job of keeping them off balance, utilizing my off-speed stuff a little more.\"At least Giolito wasn't wild, walking just one of the 23 batters he faced.But as he said, many of his pitches caught too much of the plate. He threw a fastball to catcher Russell Martin in the third that tailed over the plate. Martin hammered it 406 feet to the seats in left field.One inning earlier, shortstop Lourdes Gurriel Jr. stroked his second hit of the night. It marked his 10th consecutive multi-hit game, breaking Toronto's franchise record. The streak is tied for the seventh longest in MLB history, last achieved by the Yankees' Bernie Williams in 2002.Gurriel might have deserved a standing ovation, but the Sox crowd was understandably more into the home team.And with Jace Fry on the hill and two outs in the ninth, the majority of the robust crowd rose to their feet. Some even held up their phone and hit the little red record button.Fry struck out Kendrys Morales, and the Sox celebrated on the field with a handshake line.Amid a season of frustrating losses, this game provided a satisfying end.\"It makes me look to the future when we have a lot more games like this,\" Giolito said. \"When we're winning and playing well, it's going to be a really good time.\"tgreenstein@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "130"}

{"content": "Aug. 01--First of all, Eres is doing fine.The 14-foot python became something of a rock star this week up in Redding when he/she went missing as the Carr Fire closed in on the Northern California town. Sandra Dodge-Streich, owner of Redding Reptiles where Eres hung out, says the snake was placed in a plastic bin and brought to a home as flames moved closer. And then, a few days ago, the lavender albino reticulated python slithered out of the bin and went AWOL.With authorities warning residents of South Redding to keep their pets indoors while the search for Eres unfolded, Dodge-Streich insisted that the only animals with anything to fear were chickens, for which Eres apparently has a sweet fang. On Monday, searchers found Eres coiled up in a milk crate.With that happy ending to our story, let's look at some other snake-and-wildfire stories out there:Rattlers in the Burned-out ZoneResearchers at Central Washington University wondered what became of critters who had fled a fire zone. What happens after the fire is put out? Joey Chase, a graduate student with a keen interest in how wildfires affect rattlers, started tracking two male Northern Pacific rattlesnakes, each about 10 years old. He found them in an area where fire had burned 36 square miles in Kittitas County, according to a report in the Yakima Herald. Chase wants to know if the snakes, whom he's embedded with small radio transmitters and data loggers to gauge their body temperature, will stay away from the burned area. He planned to track the snakes' movements a couple of times a week until the devices were removed. \"This is going to be the first study seeing how rattlesnakes are going to be affected by these large-scale events, which are getting more frequent and intense,\" said Chase. He's hoping the snakes come back to the fire areas, because removing one animal from such an intricate ecosytem, he said, could have negative effects on other members of that system, including eagles, owls, and badgers who feed on the rattlers.Sunbathing in a Charred LandscapeOther scientists are trying to find out if wildfires might actually be a good thing for snakes, opening up a tree canopy and creating more sun-basking opportunities for rattlesnakes. Penn State postdoctoral researcher Chris Howey has been looking into it and watching how snakes respond to wildfires. Howey and his colleagues say timber rattlesnakes bask in sunny areas in order to absorb the heat they need to thrive. Fire can wreak havoc on that forest canopy, they say, and therefore the mosaic of light and temperatures on the forest floor affects snakes in different ways than before the fire thinned out the foliage overhead.The Snake EscapeWriting in her blog, Tough Little Birds, UC Berkeley researcher Katie LaBarbera has explored how various animals do when wildfire consumes their habitat. \"Most of the evidence suggests that animals can handle fire just fine,\" she writes. \"Birds, larger mammals, and snakes move away from fire. Frogs are safe if they can get to water. The animal you might most expect to be in big trouble, the turtle, has been frequently found in perfect health immediately after burns: they hide in burrows underground. Smaller mammals may move or hide in burrows.\" LaBarbera says studies of a wildfire's effect on different animals have shown that \"in a population of eastern diamondback rattlesnakes, the only mortalities were individuals in the midst of shedding their skin, which may have impaired their ability to sense or escape from the fire.\"One Snake's Wildfire Disaster is another Snake's SalvationSnakes and wildfires is a tale of two habitats. An article on The Wildlife Society's website says that \"while the drought-stricken western United States is doing all it can to prevent wildfires, in the eastern portion of the country fire prevention spells doom for the once-thriving eastern diamondback rattlesnake.\" In a study several years ago published by Jennifer Fill in PLOS ONE, the University of South Carolina graduate writes that forest fire prevention in the savannas of the Southeast has led to loss of habitat for the rattlesnake. \"Fire is so important to the eastern diamondback's habitat that fire exclusion is a serious barrier to diamondback conservation,\" Fill writes. She says that eastern diamondbacks have lost close to 100 percent of their original habitat and continue to decline in number. \"In fact,\" says the article, \"eastern diamondbacks are considered endangered in North Carolina, and the last verified sighting of the snake in Louisiana was in 1995.\" In the past, wildfire ensured a staple habitat for the snake, \"which prefers the open-canopy pine forests and savannas that are disappearing throughout its territory. Longleaf pines are the characteristic trees of these environments and are highly fire resistant. These trees are an integral part of habitat recovery after forest fires.\" Suppress the fires, and you potentially remove a key element of the rattlesnake's survival.Watch Out for Fleeing CrittersWhen wildfires strike, especially near urban and residential areas, many of the wild animals take off running -- or, in the case of an 8-foot-long rattlesnake fleeing the Spring Fire last month in southern Colorado, slithering. Evacuation centers are quickly set up for domestic animals when their owners have to quickly flee their homes, and stories abound about everything from cattle to horses to parakeets being rescued by animal-loving Good Samaritans. The Spring Fire sent this rattler fleeing for its life, which created challenges for homeowners living on its flight path. Some species easily escape a wildfire, some perish and others may even thrive as a result of the flames. Birds take to the air, mammals run, and many smaller creatures burrow into the ground to escape the fire. Snakes have been known to suddenly show up in residential subdivisions, which is why residents still in their homes near a wildfire are encouraged to keep their pets indoors and their eyes open for any new visitors sliding through the backyard.___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "132"}
{"content": "Aug. 03--10 thoughts after the Chicago Bears opened preseason with the Baltimore Ravens a week ahead of the rest of the NFL. The Ravens won 17-16 at Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium.1. The Bears would have far preferred if their first-rounder was their most newsworthy draft pick on Thursday -- not their seventh-rounder -- but the negotiating impasse for inside linebacker Roquan Smith continues and wide receiver Javon Wims put together a nice second half with seven receptions for 89 yards.Be careful not to get ahead of yourself when it comes to Wims, but understand that the solid showing comes after the former Georgia Bulldog put together some nice practices in Bourbonnais. That is the key for late-round picks and undrafted free agents. They have to continually pop and catch the attention of coaches and decision makers. It's early in the process and Wims is going to have to do a lot more to state his case for a roster spot at a position where things will get interesting.The Bears sat out 27 players, not including Smith, and four of them were wide receivers -- Allen Robinson, Anthony Miller, Taylor Gabriel and Kevin White. You figure that the Bears will wind up keeping six wide receivers on the 53-man roster and those four have a spot. I would give a nod right now to veteran Josh Bellamy, who has experience on special teams and has been worked in some with the first unit on occasion. Next, you're looking at Wims and perhaps Bennie Fowler, the veteran who came over from the Broncos. Fowler signed a $1 million, one-year contract with $200,000 guaranteed. That is who Wims is competing against. Fowler is a proven player on special teams (he played for assistant special teams coordinator Brock Olivo in Denver) and has been a little more productive than Bellamy on offense in his career.\"It was a good showing for my first NFL game,\" Wims said. \"My coaches told me to stay ready and so did my teammates, stay ready. Every opportunity you get, just try to make the most of it. I think camp has gone good. Every day I am learning something new. Every day I am getting better.\"Wims' good hands were on display in the back-shoulder throw he caught at the start of the fourth quarter, outmaneuvering Ravens rookie cornerback Anthony Averett for a 24-yard gain. Wims doesn't possess top end speed and he might lack the sudden quickness to shake better cornerbacks but he's had a nice camp so far and this performance backs that up. He just needs to keep stacking productive practices now.2. Adrian Amos was one of the many Bears who got the night off, but the fourth-year safety was paying close attention to the action and is eager to review film of several 15-yard penalties that were handed out by referee Walt Coleman's crew. The Ravens were specifically penalized twice for use of the helmet penalties and Baltimore picked up two more unnecessary roughness calls, both 15-yarders. Bears safety Nick Orr also got a 15-yard unnecessary roughness call. On the couple replays I saw on a TV that was mounted high in the press box, it didn't look like a bad hit. Amos was in agreement and it's a real question for defensive players around the league: Is the game going to be officiated differently?\"We just have to go back and look at them and see what they are,\" Amos said. \"They looked like pretty good hits. I don't know. We'll see.\"I asked him if it's the beginning of a trend we'll see unfold in preseason, is it going to force him to evaluate how he goes about bringing down ball carriers or receivers?\"I've got to play football,\" he said. \"I have to protect myself and play football. I'm not going to not tackle someone. I'll let them (officials) make a determination afterward. I can only control what I can control.\"In doing that, he will have to hope that he maintains control of his wallet as well. Amos certainly doesn't want any fine notifications arriving at Halas Hall.\"Yeah,\" he said. \"We'll see.\"3. Jonathan Bullard figures to be in line for a starting job as a defensive end and he might be the only eventual starter that wound up playing in this game. He ran Ravens quarterback Robert Griffin III out of bounds for a sack, which was good to see. Bullard totaled two tackles and as he prepares for his third season, he's hoping to build his effort near the end of last season when he began getting more playing time with Mitch Unrein sidelined.\"Last year, the last four or five games I started and that really helped me at the position,\" Bullard said. \"Just having reps. Repeated reps are always huge.\"Roy Robertson-Harris is pushing Bullard and he also picked up a sack as the defense totaled eight in the loss to the Ravens. A little more consistency from both of them would help out up front where they've got a good thing going right now.\"We've got two solid guys in Akiem (Hicks) and Eddie (Goldman) right there,\" Bullard said. \"Just need some production out of that right side end. That's my job and hopefully I can step in. If we start getting production from all three spots, we can be even better.\"4. One player that is going to be interesting to track in preseason is punter Pat O'Donnell. He averaged 57 yards on four punts, so it was a good effort. The Ravens got 24 yards on three punt returns; the Bears would like to get better there, but a 45.8 net average for O'Donnell is nice. The Bears created competition for him in the spring when they signed Ryan Winslow, an undrafted free agent from Pitt. The team kept a close eye on Winslow and brought him to Halas Hall for a pre-draft visit.O'Donnell returned on a one-year contract worth $1.5 million with $500,000 guaranteed. That's not exactly a ton of job security for a fifth-year player and that's why the addition of Winslow made things interesting. Still, O'Donnell is the incumbent and special teams coordinator Chris Tabor had some particularly interesting stuff to say about the veteran from Bourbonnais earlier this week. O'Donnell primarily used what is known as the \"flip flop\" punt last season -- the rugby-style kick that goes end over end. That was under the direction of former special teams coordinator Jeff Rodgers and there are a variety of factors that surely went into the decision process. It's a conservative kick that is more difficult to return because of the height and hang time. It also doesn't travel as far as a traditional spiral punt.\"There are a lot of things with the flip-flop,\" Tabor said. \"You can work faster and control it. I have used it before as an open-field punt. I used it in Cleveland a couple times. We were playing (Pittsburgh's) Antonio Brown and we didn't want to outkick our coverage and give him a head start as it's higher and shorter. We've worked from the spring changing some things up with Pat and he has been, to his credit, a true pro's pro. He's accepted it and attacked it and that's why I am anxious for him and excited for him.\"The Bears have tweaked O'Donnell's steps and his stance and the hope is it produces bigger and more consistent results.\"He's been awesome,\" Tabor said. \"We've changed some things with him on the regular punt. We're going to see where he's at. He's really worked. I am anxious to see where he's at.\"I asked Tabor if, based on the fact that he hasn't asked his punters to use the flip-flop punt much in the past, if he's more of a proponent of a regular punt.\"I am,\" he said. \"But I am a proponent of what the player does best. Like (Britton) Colquitt in Cleveland, he had a bunch of clubs (in his bag). He could hit the flip-flop. We worked where he would face that way (left) and hit it (right) and it looked like a shanked punt but it would roll on the ground forever. We worked on all those things. Like (Baltimore's) Sam Koch, (his punts) are hard to field because you don't know where he is going. That's the beauty of the whole thing. We're not there with our guys yet but I like where we are trending.\"Here is a breakdown of the four punts:--1. 53 yards, 4.53 seconds hang time, 12-yard return--2. 57 yards, 4.25 seconds hang time, touchback--3. 59 yards, 4.73 seconds hang time, 13-yard return--4. 59 yards, 3.71 seconds hang time, no returnThe last punt had a tremendous result, but wasn't real pretty as O'Donnell said he got it a little on the side of his foot. Still, a 59-yard net looks pretty in the stats. Winslow attempted one punt when the Bears were backed up on their own 4-yard line. He had a 50-yard punt (3.91 seconds hang time) and the Ravens lost one yard on the return.5. The NFL's new kickoff rule was put into play for the first time and it's going to be important to monitor all preseason. Tabor was one of the position coaches that traveled to New York to meet with the league when the rules were adjusted that, among other things, outlawed a running start for players on the kicking team and made wedges illegal for the return team. The idea was to eliminate as many high-speed collisions, the type of plays that lead to concussions. In essence, the kickoff has become a little bit more like the punt.What did we see? Each team had two kickoff returns (there were three touchbacks in the game) and both sides had a long of 24 yards. In other words, there is still a lot of unknown.\"I will be honest with you, there are unknowns on the deal,\" Tabor said before the trip to Canton. \"Thursday night something could happen where you're, 'I thought I thought of that. I guess I didn't.' Or, 'Well, I thought this would stress it out in the blocking scheme and sure enough it did.' What can you do to tweak it to fix it?Sherrick McManis, who has been the team's top special teams performer for the last several seasons, isn't sure what to make of the rule changes either.\"It's like anytime they make a rule change every year, you just have to adjust,\" McManis said. \"You either adjust or you don't play, you know what I mean? It's going to be fun to see how it goes and how it's officiated. A player like me is going to adjust. I think it is going to be fine.\"Does McManis believe the adjustment will make the kickoff safer because ultimately that is what will be monitored closely.\"We shall see, man,\" he said. \"Hitting is hitting. You can probably slow a person down but if you get hit the right way, it's football. It's going to be hard to stop everything from happening. We'll see how this goes.\"6. Eric Kush was probably the only potential offensive starter to play in the game. He spent the majority of training camp working at left guard and he played center, something he's done in the past. It's good work for the Bears to get Kush in the event something happens during the season. Rookie second-round pick James Daniels hasn't had a lot of action with the first team and of late he's been sidelined with a shoulder injury. So, it's fair to say Kush is asserting himself early when it comes to this job.\"Camp is good,\" he said. \"Just working hard. Trying to get better at something every day.\"The interesting dynamic for Kush is that general manager Ryan Pace knew him and liked him and coach Matt Nagy worked with him in Kansas City before so he knew him and liked him. Offensive line coach Harry Hiestand had not worked with Kush previously so that creates a little unknown for a player, especially a guy like Kush who has been around for a while but only has five career starts.\"When you have a new guy coming in, you hope he likes you and everything,\" Kush said. \"I just focus at doing what he says and try to focus on what he likes to do, certain things and that's how it goes.\"I asked Kush if the goal right now is to nail down the left guard job for Week 1.\"I am just working at getting better at what I can every day,\" he said. \"If it leads to that, I am pretty damn happy with myself. If it doesn't, I ain't gonna quit. I am going to keep on going.\"7. The Bears are here because of Brian Urlacher, who will be enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame on Saturday night, and Nagy has been certain to mention that several times. Urlacher's brilliant career, entirely with the Bears, made this possible and he was a first ballot selection in January when my former colleague Dan Pompei, whose work can now be found at Bleacher Report and The Athletic, presented Urlacher to the Hall's selection committee. I chatted with Dan about the process.What was the biggest challenge for you in preparing the case to present Urlacher to fellow selectors back in January?DP: The challenge was that it was his first time and there was a backlog of really good candidates that people felt were in line first. I know there is still some feeling about that. The other factor was he was at the same time as Ray Lewis. So, I thought it was important to show that Brian Urlacher was a strong first-ballot Hall of Fame candidate in his own right regardless of Lewis' candidacy. I made the point, 'Why can't you have two players from the same position?' I pointed out that a number of times it's happened before where you have had guys like this. There are so few times in history where you have had two of the greatest at a position come up in their first ballot so it was something that I think people were wrestling with and had to kind of get over and they did apparently.You presented Richard Dent multiple times until he was voted in. I would think as a presenter you have to develop a strategy and you get better at it the more you do it. Anyone can present Jerry Rice but when presenting other players there is real work that goes into it. What was the process like?DP: You start building a case for a Hall of Fame candidate years and years before he ever becomes eligible. You have to start gathering acorns along the way and figuring out what makes him worthy. I did that with Urlacher. I couldn't even tell you how much time I put into it because it was spread over so many years. It might have been five minutes here, a half-hour there, 45 minutes there. You know, it was not something where I just sat down one day and built a case. It was a long time building.Along those lines, do you find yourself picking up acorns for Devin Hester here and there these days?DP: Absolutely. I have started that process as well. It's something that will continue and I've got several more years to build it. Assuming that I am still on the job for the Hall of Fame, by then I will have had a lot of time to really think about why he should be a Hall of Famer.That's a different argument and one that is going to take some real work. That prototype player isn't in Canton right now, is he?DP: No. There is no one like him really and we have very few players that were primarily special teams players. So it is going to be a different one for him. But there has never been a player like Devin Hester.That might strengthen your case right there?DP: That's an important realization that I would like to share with the other members of the Board of Selectors when the time comes. He's kind of unique in NFL history and I will tell you what, there will never be another like him because of what is happening with the rules. He was a one of a kind and hopefully that will help his case.8. It's going to be interesting to see if the Bears carry a fullback on the roster. They felt like they added a solid one in Michael Burton when they claimed him off waivers last season. He appeared in all 16 games logging 179 snaps. Nagy comes from an offense that has incorporated a fullback. Anthony Sherman is entering his sixth season with the Chiefs and was used on 180 snaps on offense in Kansas City last year, almost identical to Burton's workload. The difference is Sherman led the Chiefs in special teams snaps. He was on the field for 74.2 percent of Kansas City's special teams plays. Burton was involved in 29.8 percent of special teams snaps for the Bears last season, ranking 18th on the roster.\"It's a good question,\" Nagy said earlier in camp. \"The fullback position is one that you see in our offense we don't use a whole lot of. But at the same time you can take that position and you can move him around in different areas. We talk about man, zone tells and getting an advantage with the defense. You can do that when Burton's in there. Burton right now is just, he's done everything we've asked him to do in regards to lining up at fullback and thumping a Mike linebacker on a Mike play. We'll space him out and run a stick route, we'll do different things with him and zero complaints. So he's the epitome of control what you can control and then make it tough on us when we get to creating the roster.\"Burton is doing his best not to wonder about the number crunching that comes at the end of preseason when roster decisions are made.\"I am just worried about coming out here and being the best I can be for the team and whatever coach asks me to do,\" Burton said. \"Anthony Sherman, great player, been in the league for a long time and has done some great things in Kansas City. I have watched all his film and he fits there really well. So obviously that would be something I would try to mimic.\"Burton understands the significance of special teams and is doing his best to catch the attention of Tabor.\"My goal is to be a four core special teams player,\" he said. \"It's so important.\"9. The Bears head home and will be back on the practice fields at Olivet Nazarene University on Saturday. It's going to be much warmer this weekend, with forecasted highs reaching the low 90s. I would imagine Nagy uses that to put a little more pressure on the players. The Bears are getting their work done in the morning, so they won't be in the heat of the day. Nagy talked about there being live sessions in camp before it opened and that has been quite limited to this point.10. Scouts from five NFL teams were in attendance. Represented were the Bengals, Browns (GM John Dorsey and assistant GM Eliot Wolf), Chargers (two), Eagles and Steelers (two). Two CFL teams were also present with the Calgary Stampeders and Saskatchewan Roughriders on hand.10a. There have been a handful of scouts from the CFL circulating through training camp recently. The CFL regular season is in full swing but those teams like to survey the landscape in NFL training camps and at preseason games to get a handle for players that fall through the cracks. Things are going to get interesting for the CFL, however, which will soon have competition for players that can't stick on an NFL roster. The Alliance of American Football is an eight-team league slated to get started in February after Super Bowl LIII. The XFL, which was around for one season in 2001, is scheduled to return in 2020. You're always skeptical that a second-tier football league is going to be able to put down roots and actually work but both outfits appear to be well funded, at least right now. The minimum salary in the CFL is $54,000 Canadian. That's less than half of what a player can earn in the NFL if he is able to stick it out for the entire season on a practice squad. The minimum for practice squad players bumps up to $7,600 per week this season or $129,200 for the full season. The collective bargaining agreement for players in the CFL expires next spring and if the league is struggling to attract players it would have signed in the past, the owners will have to give consideration to raising the salaries.10b. It will be fun to see many of Urlacher's former teammates in town as they gather for the induction ceremony on Saturday. It's important for them to see Urlacher honored and that's really one of the neat parts to the weekend.10c. The Ravens were running more blitzes and pressures than you usually see from teams early in the preseason. Maybe that benefits the Bears in the long run. They will certainly have some stuff to review on tape.bmbiggs@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "133"}
{"content": "Evan Blass just teased that Android P is officially launching on Aug. 20, but if you have a compatible phone, you can install it now. ( Elijah Nouvelage | Getty Images )Android P may have just gotten an official release date. According to trusted smartphone insider Evan Blass, the latest version of Android is rolling out on Aug. 20.Of course, developers have been toying around with the operating system for quite some time now thanks to a bunch of developer previews and beta versions Google has released as part of its beta program, but the general public can finally expect it soon.While Blass didn't state outright that Android P is launching on Aug. 20, he did tweet a photo of a calendar with the letter \"P\" stamped on Aug. 20, and it doesn't take a genius to figure out what that means. Just note, however, that this might indicate other things too. Maybe Google is going to reveal the official nickname of Android P on that date. Who knows?Android PAndroid P isn't exactly a radical Android release, but it does bring over a bunch of much-needed changes that significantly improve the overall experience of using an Android phone.For starters, the OS now takes into account notches because a lot of manufacturers are increasingly copying Apple's design for the iPhone X. Android P's status bar avoids the middle part as much as possible if the phone sports a notch, so nothing gets blocked from view. Google also recently revealed guidelines on notches, telling developers and manufacturers they're only allowed to put two notches per phone.Android P also eschews the traditional navigation tray in place of a much more intuitive gesture bar, which is similar to the iPhone X's gesture controls. Instead of displaying Back, Home, and Menu keys all the time, Android P now shows a tiny navigation bar. Users swipe up to go home, swipe and hold to open the multitasking tray, or swipe left and right to switch between apps. The gestures will, of course, vary depending on the manufacturer, but Google makes it possible right off the bat.How To Install Android P Right NowWhether or not Android P finally rolls out on Aug. 20, impatient users can now technically have it installed on their mobile devices. Those who have Pixel phones are in luck because the process is as easy as heading over to the Android Beta Program website and signing up to receive beta software.For those who have other phones, the process is going to be a bit more difficult. It's not impossible, though, but it will take some, time, patience, and through reading. Below is a list of phones that can run beta versions of Android P.

The move comes as the ride-hailing company faces increased scrutiny for its self-driving car test fleet. ( Josh Edelson | AFP/Getty Images )Uber is done with prospects of a self-driving truck, pivoting its energy toward cars instead. The ride-hailing company's once-huge ambitions for the future of the trucking industry has now been put on seemingly permanent hold.Uber has decided to shut down its self-driving truck program, according to TechCrunch. A spokesperson for the company has since confirmed the move.Uber Shuts Down Self-Driving Truck EffortsEmployees who have been working for the truck project will be relocated to Uber's much bigger autonomous car division. The company says it'll resume development on an in-house lidar system. Freight, another one of Uber's projects that aims to connect truck drivers with shipping companies, will be unaffected by the change, the spokesperson confirmed.\"We've decided to stop development on our self-driving truck program and move forward exclusively with cars,\" said Advanced Technologies Group head Eric Meyhofer. \"[W]e believe having our entire team's energy and expertise focused on [self-driving cars] is the best path forward.\"Uber vs WaymoUber's trucking dreams started when it acquired a self-driving truck startup called Otto in 2016, co-founded by engineer Anthony Levandowski. Not long after the acquisition, Uber entered into a nasty legal battle with Waymo, Google's self-driving car division. Waymo alleged that Levandowski stole technology while he was still working at Google \u2014 technology that it believes Uber will allegedly apply to its own projects.The scuttle was one of 2017's most covered news items in the tech world and ended with a surprise settlement: Uber agreed to give Waymo $245 million worth of private shares at its 2015 valuation, and Waymo said it would make sure Uber's self-driving car technology won't come from its trade secrets. With the legal misstep out of the way, it was expected that Uber would resume its trucking projects.Then this past March, a self-driving Uber vehicle hit and killed a woman crossing the street in Tempe, Arizona. As a result, Uber halted its test fleet.Despite the setbacks, Meyhofer says Uber will continue testing its self-driving technology going forward, but it'll focus on passenger applications first.\"I know we're all super proud of what the Trucks team has accomplished, and we continue to see the incredible promise of self-driving technology applied to moving freight across the country.

Casten is a political newcomer who emerged from a crowded Democratic primary in March, getting a shot in a year when Republicans are being asked to respond to a controversial Trump presidency in a district that Democrat Hillary Clinton won two years ago.A few hundred demonstrators and supporters of both candidates chanted and toted signs side-by-side across the entrance to the Union League Club on Jackson Boulevard before the debate.Many Casten supporters held \"Hands off our health care\" signs and chanted, \"Hey hey, ho, ho, Peter Roskam's got to go!\"Roskam supporters countered with \"If you want a leader, vote for Peter!\"The demonstrators could be heard from the sixth-floor ballroom where the candidates debated in front of an audience of about 200, some sipping Miller Lite at white-tablecloth-covered tables.In the debate streamed live online and to be televised on Fox-Ch. 32, Casten characterized the Republican federal tax overhaul Roskam helped usher through Congress as too focused on helping wealthy people. Roskam said the tax cuts will help usher economic growth.On abortion, Roskam said he's \"not going to be defensive about being pro-life\" and criticized Casten for favoring expanding the availability of taxpayer-funded abortions. Casten said abortion should be a choice between a woman and her doctor, not \"Peter and anyone else in Washington.\"\"I view abortion as a medical procedure like a gall bladder surgery,\" Casten said. \"I don't want anybody to have to have one. I can't imagine the pain that someone would go through to do that.\"\"Abortion is not gall bladder surgery,\" Roskam later replied.On health care, Roskam said President Barack Obama \"over-promised and under-delivered\" on the Affordable Care Act. Casten said the country should move toward universal health care.And on guns, Casten said people don't need military-style assault rifles. Roskam said he favors universal background checks and banning so-called bump stocks, but that people have a constitutional right to bear arms.The hourlong back and forth foreshadows three more months of intense campaigning as Democrats and Republicans focus their efforts on a few competitive districts in Illinois, including the suburban 6th.The sprawling 6th Congressional District stretches from the far northwest suburbs and sweeps southward through DuPage County. It looks on a map a bit like a hungry video game alien, its jagged jaws opening wide as if preparing to chomp on O'Hare airport.\"There's no question there will be a lot of interest in this race,\" Casten said after the debate.poconnell@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "136"}

{"content": "Location:\u00a0El Matador Beach, CATOBI\u00a0DressI spent last weekend at El Matador Beach (see last post). This was another look that went beautifully with the setting. It was extremely windy that day which made it easy to wear this\u00a0Tobidress, but a headache for my hair. I realized that you can always find some positivity in a negative situation and the result can turn out better than you expected. When your life takes a different path sooner than you were ready for, you come across challenges you don\u2019t want to face. Some people handle uncomfortable situations better than others. I for one\u2026 am still learning. I\u2019m very frustrated at the way our society is structured and how there is really only one way to live (according to societal standards). I know the younger generation is taking more risks, allowing for doors to open for the unconventional way of living. But the more I look towards my future, the more I want to be in control. Not dictated by my age, my experiences, or social status. So where does one go from here\u2026", "id": "140"}
{"content": "Everyone wants to feel better about themselves. It just makes sense. Certainly, no one sets out every morning freely thinking that they want to wade through a dark and strangling pit of depression. It\u2019s not easy being sad, but it\u2019s also not exactly easy learning how to be happy. Working on your self esteem can be a difficult journey, and some days it may seem like you are taking steps backward instead of forward.Learning how to build your self esteem doesn\u2019t have to be that long, difficult road though. It\u2019s important to take time out of every day to work on how to build self esteem, as this will benefit you in so many other aspects of your life. You will have an overall happier mood, more confidence in yourself and your abilities, and you will seem more approachable to others. Keep reading to learn what you can do to set yourself up for success on this journey.     Here\u2019s how to build self esteem:One great way to help you build self esteem is to ensure a small part of each day is dedicated solely to this aspect of your life. You can make it a part of your morning routine as you prepare yourself for the day, or set an alarm for a part of the day that you particularly struggle with. Doing this helps make the task a conscious effort that you are constantly reminding yourself to focus on. It also aids you in taking control over it.Think of it this way. If you know you have to lose weight and are trying to focus on it each day, it can be overwhelming and you may be flooded with thoughts of inadequacy and overall negative thoughts. However, if you break it down into smaller, more manageable tasks that you can gain satisfaction from crossing off, then you are already a step ahead of the game. This same concept can apply as you work on your confidence in yourself. Each day, set out to do one small thing that is going to assist you on your journey. Deciding what that task will be and the how and when of accomplishing it puts all the control in your hands. You are able to automatically feel more in charge of your life and the direction it\u2019s going by doing this.     There are a few simple ways that you can use to practice this skill. The first is to start tracking your moods and negative thoughts. This can help you determine if these thoughts are being triggered by something else, such as additional stress during a specific time at work or a premature hunger attack. A lack of sleep can also contribute to self-destructive thoughts and negativity. This list from Forbes has some great apps that you can use in this manner to help build self esteem.Once you\u2019ve conquered this step, you can begin to target the trends you found in your moods and use them to your advantage to help further boost your self esteem. For example, if your negative attitude is being caused by the dreaded 3 pm work slump, then set an alarm and make it a point to go on a quick walk outside. The extra sun and pumping heart can easily boost your mood, and you can practice saying a couple nice things about yourself along the way.As you can see, getting your self esteem to a level that makes you feel happier on a daily basis can be done by taking small steps at a time. Start tracking the things that are making you feel insecure so that you can learn patterns about your behaviors and environment as they relate to your thoughts about yourself. Once you have gained this insight on yourself, you can begin taking the necessary steps to not only correct the current issue, but prevent further issues from occurring completely.It is very important that you take the time to work on these skills, because if you don\u2019t then the issue can grow and be even more intimidating to try and tackle at a later time. Doing something about this issue each day can help you feel more in control of the situation. Gaining your self esteem can be a very powerful tool for success in life.", "id": "141"}
{"content": "Aug. 02--Homeownership is one of the primary ways Americans accumulate wealth with buyers building equity as the home's property value increases, yet a recent study shows black homeownership rates in Chicago have dropped to levels not seen since the 1960s. And even years after the Fair Housing Act passed, memories of housing discrimination linger.All of these issues are present in Arlen Parsa's latest documentary, \"Blueprint for Bronzeville,\" a selection of the Black Harvest Film Festival that will air on WTTW-Ch. 11 Thursday. (You can also watch it on the website, www.blueprintforbronzeville.com.) Parsa takes viewers back to the origins of that South Side neighborhood in light of the city's aspirations to host the 2016 Olympics. Chicago lost its bid for the Olympics in 2009, but when it was still in the running, the city wanted to put a stadium in Bronzeville's Washington Park. The plans were supposed to bring economic development to the area, but Bronzeville residents also wanted to see the city-owned vacant lots in their area taken care of before gentrification took place. A group of Bronzeville residents fed up with the number of vacant lots in the community wants to remedy the situation by making sure potential developers build affordable housing on a fraction of empty lots. According to the film, politicians and city administrators didn't address the issue until the Olympics were a possibility, but the community organization Housing Bronzeville drew the line in the sand. The documentary follows residents' journey against the backdrop of the city's history of racial segregation and ongoing fight for equity.We talked to Parsa prior to the broadcast premiere as the South Side is dealing with concerns about the Obama center. This conversation has been edited for space and clarity.Q: Why this film now? Was it part of the plan to come out amid the decision-making around the Obama center?A: It's certainly a topic that's on people's minds. We've held screenings of this film in different neighborhoods around the city, and in certain neighborhoods people are asking the question, \"Well what about displacement over the library?\" Anything that comes into a neighborhood that's been ignored historically could be a double-edged sword. People are asking the very same types of questions with the Olympics as they are the library, and I also heard the same questions about \"What if Amazon comes here (to build their second headquarters)?\" I don't know what's going to happen, but I think a lot of people are looking at it cautiously and hopefully.Q: How did you choose the project?A: This was sort of a passion project that started off as a school project many years ago at Columbia College. My co-producer Tristan Hanson and I were looking for a film to make about gentrification in Chicago, and we became fascinated with the Bronzeville neighborhood because at the time, there was a lot of talk about maybe this neighborhood could gentrify because they could put a lot of Olympic infrastructure in there, and there was concern that people might get displaced, historic residents might be priced out of the neighborhood. So we decided to go down, and we met with a bunch of different community groups and activists, and we fell in love with this group Housing Bronzeville because they were charming, they had had a couple successful referendums and they seemed like they weren't shy about speaking the truth for fear of getting their funding cut off. We were fascinated and kind of jumped in there.Q: As an outsider looking in, what is your reaction to the city's segregation?A: I'm from New Hampshire, and my fellow filmmaker is from the West Coast. We met in Chicago and we started asking questions like: \"Why is this city still so segregated in some places, and what's the history behind that?\" We started asking questions that led to some uncomfortable truths. It's easy for somebody like me to think in the North, we didn't have segregation, we didn't have some of these problems. It's very easy to forget some of this history that is in many ways tragic and still impacts the shape of our city today. So learning about some of this history and really taking a deep dive really opens your eyes about the way neighborhoods are shaped today. It's a tragic history and one that's uncomfortable to talk about and think about, but I think it's important history and to me as an outsider, it was a privilege to come in and gain trust with the local community residents and hear their stories from the ground level. Bronzeville is a neighborhood that has had lots of other people decide what's going to be best for it from the top down, so we wanted to give this neighborhood a voice that in some ways has been denied.Q: You left viewers on a good note with the documentary, but what's transpired since then?A: They (the housing group) have been working with a developer and an architect, but the financing piece of the puzzle is the piece that is missing. However, in the past couple of weeks, the city announced this pilot program to provide vacant city-owned lots for new, affordable homes for people within a certain income range that would be subsidized. It's almost what this group wants, the only problem is Bronzeville is not included in the six neighborhoods that they're doing this in. It's extraordinarily frustrating for the group because they want this, and they've come up with this plan and it's getting implemented, but just in other neighborhoods.\"Blueprint for Bronzeville\" airs 10 p.m. Thursday on WTTW-Ch.11.drockett@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "142"}
{"content": "She\u2019s the character many love to hate on Orange is the New Black. But Piper Chapman has gotten an undeserved bad rap.If you look on any number of Orange is the New Black websites, you won\u2019t see a lot of love for Piper. In fact, some have gone so far as to say she shouldn\u2019t even be on the show! Depending on your own life experience, Piper may seem at times whiny and privileged, which is pretty valid.But for some of us, she\u2019s a very relatable character. For some of us who struggle with the simplest things \u2014 like, say, germs, insects and anything gross \u2014 Piper\u2019s difficulty adjusting to prison life without no flip-flops makes perfect sense. Of course, those of us who relate to her may be whiners too and not even realize it.That aside, Piper has many good qualities. Despite what some have said, the series wouldn\u2019t be the same without her.The point of view factorToday, OITNB features a diverse ensemble cast, where many different perspectives are represented. But in the beginning, the story was about a white yuppie woman having to leave her comfortable life of diet cleanses and bath products to go to prison. Based on the true story of Piper Kerman from her book, Orange is the New Black, the show took us into prison life from her point of view. Just as it would be different if everything had been told from Tasha\u2019s point of view, this is Piper\u2019s story.Even if OITNB weren\u2019t based on a true story, her privileged background makes sense. From a writer\u2019s point of view, this type of character would seem to have the most difficult time adjusting, creating endless opportunities for conflict and even comedy.She could have been shopping at Pottery Barn one day and then found herself suddenly being strip-searched by a no-nonsense prison guard the next. Piper helps those of us who would have never given it a second thought to understand the isolation and dehumanization of prison life.Her own brand of intelligenceIn the very beginning, Piper makes an off-handed critical remark about Red\u2019s food. So Red (Kate Mulgrew) begins to starve her. Meal after meal, Piper isn\u2019t served.As a result, Piper tries the only approach that has ever worked in the world she comes from: talking it out and apologizing. But this won\u2019t work here. Red explains why, even feeling somewhat sorry for her. Once Piper\u2019s perceived as weak, she will be weakened.So Piper has to do something nice for her, something that will show Red\u2019s followers why she deserves to be back in Red\u2019s good graces. And Piper is resourceful. Using chewed up jalapenos (eek!), she\u2019s able to make a lotion for Red\u2019s sore back, something similar to what Piper had sold in her artisanal bath product line. It\u2019s a long shot, but it works.AdaptiveYou have to admit that a woman whose biggest concern is the size of her engagement ring doesn\u2019t seem a likely candidate to survive prison. But as with everything else, Piper is an overachiever.So she tries on the tough persona to survive. Yeah, she goes overboard, but she\u2019s what she thinks she has to. Speaking of overachieving, say what you want about her, but when Piper commits to something, she goes all in.Sure, the nasty underwear business may have been ill-advised, but it does work! You have to admire her pluckiness. Even in season 6, she\u2019s still trying to make the best out of a bad situation.Non-stereotypicalWhen straight society often only sees women who love women as butch, it\u2019s nice to see a character who could be on the cover of Better Homes and Gardens. Nothing teaches mainstream society more about LGBT characters than to turn stereotypes upside-down. Granted, Piper seems closer to being bisexual (despite Orange is the New Black\u2018s not using the term).The object of Piper\u2019s affection, the jet-setting lesbian Alex (Laura Prepon), might also not show up on anyone\u2019s gaydar. Alex is a beguiling character who leans a little on the Goth side. Piper and Alex\u2019s relationship is sweet, twisted, and frustrating, like so many real-life relationships.No matter what anyone says, the sparks between these two generate enough heat to power the entire series, even if sometimes they make you want to bang your head against a wall.The gatewayPiper is the intro character in season 1. Because of her, we go on a journey in subsequent seasons that includes characters not seen enough on either the big or small screen: black women, Hispanic women, women over the age of 40, LGBT women, and women with mental and terminal illnesses.This is so important because we\u2019re living in a pack-like society where your social media tends to be filled with friends who look like you and who share your political views. Granted, for some of us it would be too stressful to argue politics every day when all we want is to play Candy Crush.But because of these packs, we tend to live in a bubble where our own ideas are constantly reinforced. Those of us who could relate more to Piper have had our eyes opened to others\u2019 life experiences that differ from our own.So even though Piper is sometimes the over-the-top cheerleader amidst inmates who are trying to fashion weapons out of toothbrushes, remember that she has opened many viewers\u2019 eyes to the realities not only of prison, but also of minorities trying to survive in this world.For all of that, she\u2019s a character worth rooting for.", "id": "143"}
{"content": "July 28--If the Blackhawks' were opening training camp this weekend, Corey Crawford wouldn't be on the ice.Seven months after sustaining what would turn out to be a season-ending injury, he's not ready.Five months after an ill-advised attempt to practice in Arizona, the last time Crawford skated, he's still not ready to play.No matter how badly Hawks fans want him to play or how much his coaches and teammates support him, the goaltender is still not ready even to begin skating again.That time will come, he assured the media before the opening ceremonies of Friday's 11th annual Blackhawks Convention, but he's not there.Not yet.\"I'm feeling pretty good right now,\" Crawford said. \"I'm not 100 percent, but we have come a long way in the last couple of months and worked really hard to do whatever I can to get better. I'm excited to be here right now and see all the guys and get that feeling of being back in it.\"Crawford's injury is believed to be concussion-related, though the Hawks have referred to it steadfastly as an \"upper-body injury.\" When asked specifically what has kept him sidelined, he declined to say.\"We can't disclose that, and I ask you just to respect that,\" Crawford said. \"There have been a lot of rumors -- people tend to do that speculation. That's normal. But we're not going to discuss any of that. What's important right now is getting better and getting prepared for the start of the season.\"The Hawks' season took a dive when Crawford got hurt. They were 17-13-5 when he got hurt Dec. 23 at New Jersey and went 16-26-5 the rest of the way, ending up in last place and missing the playoffs for the first time in 10 seasons.Crawford thought he was making enough progress in mid-February to join the team for a trip and face shots during a morning skate. He hasn't been back on the ice since.\"We tried that to see where I was at, and it didn't work out,\" Crawford said. \"I would have liked to have come back at that time or even before that, but it really wasn't in the cards to do that. It wasn't smart to do that and maybe create something worse.\"Nobody knows how important Crawford is to the Blackhawks more than coach Joel Quenneville, who said he has no doubt the two-time Stanley Cup winner will be back in the net. Returning from a serious injury and having to prove himself again seems consistent with how Crawford has been perceived over the years.\"He gets counted out a lot of times,\" Quenneville said. \"He doesn't really get the accolades (as) a goalie who has proven he can win at that elite level. We all believe in 'Crow,' and I think he's excited about getting ready and being Crow like we always have seen.\"When Crawford got hurt, the Hawks turned to unproven goalies Jean-Francois Berube, Anton Forsberg and Jeff Glass. General manager Stan Bowman didn't want that to happen again and signed veteran goalie Cam Ward, whom he expects to serve as Crawford's backup.\"Now everybody realizes what we have been saying (about Crawford) for six years now,\" Bowman said. \"This guy is overlooked often. When people are talking about the best goalies in the NHL, I never understood why he wasn't in that discussion. Now with him not being here it seems like he is getting noticed for how important he is. We're excited. We're hopeful.\"Blackhawks goalie coach Jimmy Waite has been in contact with Crawford during the offseason, texting with him and checking in on his progress. He said Crawford won't return to the ice until he's \"100 percent,\" and he's just not there yet.\"Getting back on the ice, it's not a big deal right now,\" Waite said. \"We're still six weeks away from camp. I think if he can get back on the ice a couple of weeks before camp that first week, maybe he's going to be rusty, but that comes back real quick. He's working in the gym off ice, so he's going to be ready. I'm not worried about it.\"Crawford did not seem at ease talking to reporters, choosing his words carefully. In addition to declining to disclose his injury, he also declined to share what types of treatments he was getting.\"It hasn't been easy,\" he said. \"But I'll be back.\"jgreenfield@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "144"}

{"content": "We all have terrible days; there is always something in the back of our minds that keep tearing us apart slowly once in a while. Nowadays, it is hard always to stay positive. I believe that for us to make huge differences in our lives, we need to work on the little things. That is why when I have a bad day, I usually pull out some cards where I have written down motivational quotes to keep me going.I have written different kinds of motivational quotes for different seasons on different cards. I tend to like having the cards; you don\u2019t have to print your motivational quotes down, but having them around in any form helps.     Below is a list of my favorite motivational quotes that help me get through the toughest moments of my days. I hope they shed light on your path as you sail through the storms in your life.Here are 10 motivational quotes to keep you going:\u201cTomorrow is fresh, and it has no mistakes in it.\u201d by Lucy Maud Montgomery     If you plan failed today, that is okay. You have tomorrow to bounce back. You could have made some mistakes today, but you need to know that mistakes do happen. When you turn off your lights to sleep at night, remind yourself that you are going to start a new day which carries new opportunities. Tomorrow is always a gift.\u201cBecome the change you wish to see in the world\u201d by Mahatma GandhiThis is among the great motivational quotes about life that stands the test of time. I love it. It tells us to make a mark in the future. You need to be the change in this world, and you need to act on what you want to be in this world. Change always starts with one person.     \u201cIf an opportunity does not knock, build a door\u201d by Milton BerleThere are times when we feel like we are not getting the opportunity that we want. But the truth is, you don\u2019t have to wait for it, you can create it. You need to go out there, fight and create the opportunity you want for yourself. You can do it!\u201cDo not let one cloud cover the whole sky\u201d by Anais NinThis is one of my best quotes because it tells us to avoid letting the small things affect us too much. I have come to realize that our plan will not always go as we thought. You should not let a small hiccup or problem cause darkness in your life. You don\u2019t have to feel like the world is against you because of one problem. Just acknowledge the problem and move on without letting it take center stage.\u201cOut of difficulties grow miracles\u201d by Jean De La BruyereThis quote helps me get into action especially when things are not working out well. It helps me to look for opportunities when others are losing their minds. Interesting enough, when I focus on getting things done with a sober mind, I end up getting a way out of it by letting a friend in to help or solving the issue myself or another way comes in that I never expected; that is a miracle.\u201cBelieve in yourself and everything that is in you. There is something inside you that is greater than any challenge\u201d by Christian D. LarsonWhen the tough times get to you, there are situations when you feel like you cannot complete what you started. You feel inferior and even a failure, but that is when you need this quote. It is such an inspiring quote that usually helps me to stick to my path and even drive new energy into what I\u2019m doing.\u201cWhen you have faith it\u2019s like having wings\u201d by J.M BarrieThis is a quote that comes from the Broadway show, \u201cFinding Neverland.\u201d Faith means different things to different people. Always have faith in anything that I do. However small your faith is, you can grow it to build belief in yourself to achieve what you want to achieve.\u201cMost obstacles melt away when we decide to walk boldly through them\u201d by Orison Swett MardenThere are times when I feel down because of the things that go through my mind. But when I got to read this quote, I realized that my perceptions are what makes me feel down and its a relief how getting through yourself can create possibilities of doing more.\u201cWe must accept finite disappointment, but we must never lose infinite hope\u201d Martin Luther King JR.I came to realize that hope is the best thing to counter the disappointments that will always come but only for a while. When you learn to have hope in any challenge, you have a good chance of becoming a better person no matter the outcome.\u201cIt does not matter where you are on the journey of life, that\u2019s exactly where you need to be. The next road is always ahead,\u201d Oprah WinfreyOne of Oprah\u2019s best motivational quotes about life teaches us always to appreciate everything that happens to us no matter how painful it can be because it is the only way for us to move on to the next path of our lives.ConclusionMotivational quotes help to bring new energy into our lives to keep pushing on our goals and objectives. we hope the quotes listed above will spark a new light in your life when you feel stuck.", "id": "146"}

{"content": "July 25--There are no guarantees Kris Bryant will return to the Cubs lineup on Thursday, and manager Joe Maddon didn't rule out Bryant making another trip to the 10-day disabled list because of recurring pain in his left shoulder.\"I can't tell you it's impossible,\" Maddon said Wednesday after Bryant, the 2016 National League MVP, missed his second straight start. \"I don't know that. Everything is in play right now. I just got to hear from him and the doctors.\"Maddon stressed patience in assessing Bryant's injury, especially since he missed 16 games from June 22 to July 10 because of discomfort that he tried to play through for at least one month. Maddon said that Bryant hasn't received a cortisone shot yet.\"Part of it is the pain tolerance,\" Maddon said of Bryant's measuring stick for playing. \"You know what it's like when something hurts. You're working athletically and you get to that point where it grabs you, and you anticipate the grab and that can restrict you and lead to something else possibly.\"I just know he's not comfortable with it. And I know he said one swing in the game bothered him, a ball hit to the right side. That's what I do know. I can't anticipate good or bad.\"Since returning from his first DL stint, Bryant was batting .250 (10-for-40) with two home runs and eight RBIs.\"Of course we want him back as soon as possible,\" Maddon said. \"But I don't know that this is something you can necessarily rush right now. Let it rest. Listen to the doctors and figure it out. Try to avoid testing it until they tell you it's OK to test it.\"Tommy La Stella started Wednesday's game at third base in place of Bryant, and backup catcher Victor Caratini -- a former corner infielder -- worked at third with coach Brian Butterfield before the game. David Bote, who is currently at AAA Iowa, made 11 starts at third for the Cubs during his time with the major-league team. Ian Happ and Javier Baez have made seven starts each at third.In other injury news, Maddon said pitcher Yu Darvish will throw his second bullpen session Friday in St. Louis. Darvish, recovering from right triceps tendinitis, threw 16 pitches off a mound Tuesday for the first time since suffering recurring discomfort on June 28. Darvish hasn't pitched in a game since May 20.mgonzales@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "148"}

That hamlet is the site of the historically acclaimed Wawona Hotel, now known as Big Trees Lodge. And fans of the hotel around the world have been fretting in recent days over the safety and salvation of the beloved inn.Cal Fire on Friday offered these updates on the Ferguson Fire burning its way through Mariposa County:* 73,560 acres;* 41 percent contained;* now in its 22st day after starting on July 13 in the Sierra National Forest* 2,845 personnel are fighting it, with 136 engines, 50 water tenders, 14 helicopters, 66 crews, 5 masticators and 38 dozers;* there have been 2 fatalities and 11 injuries;* 10 structures have been destroyed;Firefighters worked throughout the night Thursday to contain a couple of spot fires outside Wawona.Another major concern for Cal Fire is the Carr Fire, which started on July 23 and is straddling Shasta and Trinity counties.

{"content": "YouTube\u2019s dark mode is now finally available for Android users after first coming to the iOS version of the app. It\u2019s not really that \"dark,\" though. ( Oliver Graumnitz | Pixabay )The YouTube mobile app for Android is finally getting a dark mode option, something iOS users have been able to enjoy for quite some time now.Exactly why Google allowed iOS folks to have this option first remains a mystery, but at least it's here now. YouTube had announced this past March that a dark mode option was coming to both Android and iOS after it first debuted on the Material Design-revamped version on the web.YouTube Dark Mode For AndroidAs 9to5Mac notes, the feature began rolling out just recently, with users seeing the \"Dark theme\" automatically applied along with a pop-up at the bottom of the screen notifying users about the feature.For those who want to switch to dark mode \u2014 experts say black backgrounds save more battery, especially on devices with AMOLED displays \u2014 head over to the Settings page, and then tap the \"General\" section. There, just beneath the \"Remind me to take a break\" feature, is where the new Dark theme toggle sits.Just note that the theme is more of a dark gray than pure black. Also, anything previously white will be converted into the dark theme, including search pages, backgrounds, tabs, and even the minimized video player. Those who totally hate the dark theme's particular shade of gray unfortunately can't opt for a deeper shade of black, though. Hopefully, YouTube introduces more options in the next update.Channels, meanwhile, will still show bars in an array of different colors. Perhaps the biggest impact is on the video page, where the video player is now black before it fully loads. This way, the initial loading experience is now less jarring to see.YouTube Dark Mode For Android Release DateAs of writing, the feature appears to still be rolling out, but given the multitude of users stumbling upon the feature, it seems to be officially stable instead of just being a limited test.In any case, it's not too significant a feature and may be turned off if preferred. Still, it's nice to see some variation within the app, especially since it hasn't received a design update for a long time.YouTube is available on both iOS and Android.Thoughts about dark mode finally coming to the Android version of YouTube? Would you rather stick to the default white theme? As always, if you have anything to share, feel free to sound them off in the comments section below!", "id": "150"}

Should they pursue any of these foreign born players, either with the MLE or a minimum contract?The Dallas Mavericks are settling in to next year\u2019s roster and the team is starting to look pretty good. Although we still have a number of guys who are trying to find their place in the league, the bulk of the rotation is filled with great players and great potential. I am looking forward to seeing what this team can do.The Mavs are also full of foreign born players. I broke down the list of guys on the team that were born outside of the US in a previous post which you can read here. As of now, Dallas has at least one player on the roster from North America, Africa, Europe, Asia, and Australia. They also have J.J. Barea from Central America.The only inhabited continent left for the Mavs to get a player from is South America, but there are limited options available from that part of the world. Still, I thought it would be fun to put together a short list of guys that Dallas could look at in free agency that were not born in the United States. Not all of them are from South America, but I did find options there.The movement of players from overseas has been growing over the past few decades. Dirk Nowitzki was one of the biggest names that helped bring about the current European era. Not much has changed with that as more and more players from around the world are being scouted and making their way to the league.Here are three guys the Mavs could look into for the final roster spot.", "id": "151"}
{"content": "After 18 years as the Warriors\u2019 public-address announcer, Matt Hurwitz and the team have parted ways. Hurwitz, 47, was informed recently that Golden State is making several changes to its in-game operations and has opted to go in a different direction with its PA announcer. It was emphasized to Hurwitz that the team\u2019s decision was in no way a reflection of his performance.   \u201cIt was amicable,\u201d Hurwitz said in a phone interview. \u201cThere were no hard feelings. Obviously, it was a bit of a surprise and disappointing news to hear, but I totally understand that these things happen with sports and with roles like myself. I\u2019m obviously grateful for the experience that I had with them.\u201d Hurwitz got his start in PA announcing when his track coach at San Diego State asked him to announce one of their meets. After graduating from SDSU with a degree in speech communication, he moved back to his hometown of San Francisco and got a job doing PA work for Cal athletics. Since then, Hurwitz has become a staple at Bay Area sporting events, including calling games for the Earthquakes and Sharks. Over the past 22 years, Hurwitz has been the voice of Menlo College sports. He also is a regular at San Francisco State basketball and volleyball games. In addition to his PA-announcing gigs, Hurwitz has worked in production with local TV crews. Perhaps no job has been more memorable, however, than his role with the Warriors.  Three years after subbing for a game, he was hired in December 2000 as Golden State\u2019s primary PA announcer. For nearly two decades, Hurwitz had a courtside seat for the franchise\u2019s evolution from perennial doormat to back-to-back NBA champion.", "id": "152"}

{"content": "July 30--The boxes full of police interview reports and court transcripts paint a vivid narrative of Marshall \"Butch\" Morgan Jr.'s slaying.The Illinois Institute of Technology basketball player was shot three times during a street robbery. Then he was dragged into his own car and left to die.That account of Morgan's 1993 death, according to thousands of pages of notes, investigative reports and evidence logs, prevailed for years. It led to the conviction of one man for murder and the guilty plea of a second man. Both spent years in prison for the crime.But 25 years after Morgan's half-naked body was found wedged between the front and back seats of his mother's abandoned blue Chevrolet Cavalier on South Michigan Avenue, questions surrounding the suspects, witnesses and police tactics turn a clear-cut version of events into a swirling fog.The two men accused of killing the 20-year-old honor student are now free. According to attorneys, a leading alternative suspect -- Morgan's father -- sits in prison, the admitted killer of a woman under circumstances similar to his son's death. And the statements of the accused and several key witnesses used as the basis for the case are in doubt, the result, some say, of police coercion and brutality.With so much lingering uncertainty, the question remains the same as it did in May 1993: Who killed Marshall Morgan Jr.?Case seemed open and shutMorgan, a 5-foot-7 sophomore guard who averaged 18 points a game and wanted to become a lawyer, was last seen on May 8, 1993. He was supposed to meet his girlfriend at the Days Inn on Lake Shore Drive, but he never showed up and never called.Morgan's whereabouts were unknown for nine days. The case drew citywide attention. His family and the police made up \"Have You Seen This Missing Person?\" posters and flyers, with a description of Morgan and what he was last seen wearing: blue jean shorts, a black T-shirt underneath a black-and-white striped jersey, black Converse gym shoes.Morgan's decomposing body was found May 17 after police responded to 5708 S. Michigan Ave. for a report of a foul odor coming from an abandoned car. An autopsy determined he had been shot three times, once in the abdomen and twice in the back.By the end of May, two men from the Pullman neighborhood, Tyrone Hood and Wayne Washington, were arrested and charged with Morgan's murder. Police said the two men killed Morgan between 9 and 11 p.m. May 8, the Saturday before Mother's Day, at 104th Street and Maryland Avenue.Washington told police Hood shot Morgan as the pair robbed him, a statement he later said was false, the result of police punching and slapping him while he was handcuffed. That version of events prevailed at Hood and Washington's criminal trials three years later. Hood was convicted of murder and sentenced to 75 years in prison. Washington's trial ended in a hung jury. He later pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 25 years in prison.Unusual circumstancesLawyers have said for years, and argued in a series of legal filings and appeals, that Hood and Washington did not kill Morgan, and that instead the likely suspect is actually Morgan's father, Marshall Morgan Sr., a man with a troubled past and, they say, a motive.Six months before Morgan Jr.'s death, his father took out a life insurance policy on his son and listed himself as the beneficiary of the policy. An Allstate Insurance review of the case ultimately awarded Morgan Sr. a $50,000 payout following the charges against Hood and Washington.\"A suspect has been placed in jail for the murder with the robbery being the apparent motive,\" one of the insurance company's reviewers wrote. \"No beneficiary involvement. Please approve.\"Adding to the suspicion in the years following Morgan Jr.'s killing was the revelation that the father pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter for killing a man in 1977. Two years after his son's death, Morgan Sr. received $107,000 in life insurance after the shooting death of his fiancee Michelle Soto. No one has been charged in Soto's death.Then, Morgan Sr. pleaded guilty to killing his girlfriend Deborah Jackson during an argument on a Chicago street in 2001. Jackson's body was found inside an abandoned car, a scenario and circumstance with eerie similarities to Morgan Jr.'s case.Morgan Sr. is in Stateville Correctional Center, serving a 75-year sentence for shooting and killing Jackson. Morgan Sr. admits to killing Jackson but has repeatedly said that he was not involved in his son's killing. He did not respond to a written request for an interview for this story.As part of a review of the Morgan case by the Cook Cook state's attorney's Conviction Integrity Unit, Assistant State's Attorney James Papa and Cook County state's attorney investigator Thomas McGreal interviewed Morgan Sr. on Oct. 16, 2012, in prison.The father told investigators he was not having financial trouble at the time of his son's death and said taking out the insurance policy was a normal practice for a father. He claimed his son wanted him listed as the policy's beneficiary.But parents don't usually purchase life insurance on the lives of their children, according to Jack Dolan, spokesman for the American Council of Life Insurers.While there are valid reasons for a child to have life insurance protection (a way to build savings that can be used later in life, obtaining permanent lifetime coverage at a less expensive rate than an adult), the basic purpose of life insurance is to compensate for a loss, Dolan said in an email. Benefits from a life insurance policy help a family cope financially following the death of a wage earner, and children rarely are the main wage earners in a family, Dolan said.McGreal, during the prison interview, asked Morgan Sr. if he killed his son.\"No I did not,\" Morgan said, according to Papa and McGreal's report.The report continued: \"Marshall Morgan Sr. said he admits to his current crime and is paying for what he did. He is not going to let anyone tell him he did what he did not do. His conscience is clear and he can sleep at night. Marshall Morgan Sr. said if he killed his son he would feel guilty. He doesn't feel guilty, because he didn't kill his son.\"State's attorney's reviewHood also has consistently denied he killed Morgan Jr., but a state's attorney's review of the case ended as it began: with Hood and Washington still on the hook for the crime.In a brief memo note dated Nov. 27, 2012, Papa wrote to Fabio Valentini, the chief of the Cook County state's attorney's criminal prosecutions bureau.\"After conducting and completing the review, it is the recommendation that no further action be taken on the matter as it pertains to the unit.\"The state's attorney's office said that one-page document is the only summary of investigators' review of the case. A spokeswoman did not make Papa available for an interview.Pages of police reports, interview notes and trial transcripts detail how the case against Hood and Washington came together.Police said Washington, during questioning, detailed how Hood spotted Morgan pull up and park his car.\"There's a vic,\" Hood told Washington, according to the June 11, 1993, report from the Area One violent crimes detective division. \"Do you want to do him?\"Hood approached Morgan, the report says, and told him, \"Low it like you owe it.\" Morgan reached into his pocket and pulled out some money. Hood asked for more, and as Morgan reached into his other pocket, the report says Hood shot him in the stomach.When he was found, Morgan was missing a gold rope chain and a Quigley South class ring and although he was believed to have about $400 on him at the time, only $17 was recovered, according to a May 21 evidence report.Twelve days after Morgan was killed, on May 20, Hood was interviewed by police investigators. The next day Hood was taken to the police crime lab, where he was given a polygraph. The polygraph operator, according to police reports, told detectives, \"Hood had indicated deception concerning knowledge and participation in this crime.\"The key piece of physical evidence connecting Hood to the shooting was his fingerprint on a Miller beer bottle in a trash bag found in the back of Morgan's car. Hood was interviewed again by police at Area One, continued to deny his involvement and said he did not believe his prints were found on any evidence.Then, according to the police report prepared by Area One detectives, \"He also spontaneously stated that 'If I don't say anything to explain, I will go to jail for a long time. If I do tell what happened, I will go to jail.'\"Witness accountsA review of the case files, transcripts, filings and documents in the state's attorney's possession, which the office made available to the Tribune in response to a freedom of information request, offers a few glimpses into the reviewers' mindset. Notes and underlining of court filings from Hood and Washington's attorneys show where prosecutors disagree or question defense arguments, summaries of evidence or constructed counternarratives.In a passage of one appeal, Hood's lawyers note that one witness in the case, Kenneth Crossley, received approximately $1,000 in exchange for his testimony, including a check for $750 and several cash payments.\"How is this exculpatory?\" one of the reviewers scribbled next to the passage.During the re-examination of the case, Papa and McGreal interviewed Crossley. Crossley and his brother, Jody, testified at trial May 8 that they heard Hood talk about wanting to commit a robbery and saw him retrieve a .38-caliber handgun with black tape around the handle.The gun used to kill Morgan Jr. was never found.Crossley said he was never given any money by the police or prosecutors in exchange for his testimony in the Morgan affair. Crossley said he signed an affidavit that had been written out for him, but that he doesn't read very well and only signed the document because he thought he was going to get out of prison on an unrelated case soon, according to McGreal's April 11, 2012, report.Papa, during the interview at Crossley's Chicago apartment, pointed him to the paragraph that states he was given close to $1,000 by police or the state's attorney to come to court during the Morgan-related trials.\"Get the f--- out of here,\" Crossley told Papa and McGreal. \"That is a damn lie. No one gave me no $1,000.\"Papa and McGreal, according to their report, pressed Crossley for details regarding anything he could remember about the Marshall Morgan Jr. slaying. But Crossley continually demurred, stating that he didn't remember much about something that happened so long ago and that medication he was taking was hurting his memory.While several witnesses in the case have changed their stories about what they saw or knew about Morgan's killing, one man, Emanuel Bob, has steadfastly maintained that he saw Hood inside Morgan's car the night of Mother's Day, pulling up outside his apartment near the crime scene to talk with Washington.Bob's story came to light nearly three years after the killing when investigators were interviewing a woman who said she might have seen Hood in the victim's car the day after Morgan disappeared. Bob happened to be visiting the woman when investigators asked her to review a photo array. Bob told police he recognized Hood and remembered seeing him the night after Morgan was killed.Sentence commutedAfter serving nearly 22 years behind bars, Hood was released from prison in the winter of 2015. Then-Gov. Pat Quinn, on his final day in office, commuted Hood's sentence, and a judge vacated his conviction on Feb. 9, 2015. Washington, who was released from prison a few years earlier, also had his conviction vacated.Quinn, in a recent telephone interview, said he tried to look at each individual petition for clemency or sentence commutation during his time in office. Hood's case stood out.\"With Tyrone Hood, I just thought that it screamed to heaven for justice,\" Quinn said. \"When you do it wrong, then the person who actually committed the murder goes free.\"Hood, who now lives in North Aurora, maintains his innocence. He and Washington have cases pending in federal court, accusing the police officers involved in the investigation of violating their civil rights.\"I didn't kill him,\" Hood said. \"So the killer has to be out there.\"After Hood's sentence was commuted, the state's attorney's office said it was not going to try him again. But no one else has been charged with the crime.\"I can't go wrong with telling the truth,\" Hood said during a recent interview in the break room of the Loevy &amp; Loevy law firm's offices in the West Loop. \"I'm comfortable with what I say because it's the truth.\"But Cook County Circuit Judge Dominica A. Stephenson remains unconvinced, twice denying Hood the final piece of his redemption puzzle: a certificate of innocence that will completely clear his record. The state has taken no position on the certificate of innocence.\"Without commenting on all of the evidence, there is, however, physical evidence and un-recanted testimony linking the petitioner to the murder of Morgan Jr. by way of his fingerprints and the testimony of Mr. Bob,\" Stephenson wrote in her opinion.Hood's lawyers argue that Morgan Sr.'s 2008 conviction for killing Jackson \"firmly established\" a \"modus operandi\" that connects him to the murder of his son.But Stephenson said there is a lack of evidence for those theories, and the alternative narrative is not enough to rule out Hood's involvement in Morgan Jr.'s death. Stephenson says Morgan's involvement in other crimes and his life insurance actions do not automatically link him to his son's killing.\"There is absolutely no physical evidence linking Morgan Sr. to this crime or crime scene,\" Stephenson wrote.Quinn said he is perplexed by the judge's rulings and by the state's neutral position.\"I'm puzzled by it,\" Quinn said. \"I'm disappointed. I really feel the state should act.\"Quinn said he believes the state's attorney's office should stand in favor of Hood's innocence, instead of taking no position.\"All of us, we have a duty to justice and if something went wrong, we've tried to do that with clemency and we've tried to act,\" Quinn said.Hood's arrest for murder and armed robbery remains on his record. It also means he has not been able to collect $200,000 compensation from the state for a wrongful conviction.Hood said that because he was linked to Morgan through the fingerprint, he is now ultra-careful with his garbage. He has a lock on his garbage can lid that he clasps every night.\"I'm stuck. I feel like an ex-felon. I feel like an innocent man who is an ex-felon,\" Hood said. \"I just feel like I want the same thing as before all this happened: I want my name back. It feels like someone has a hold of my name and is keeping it.\"When asked about Bob's story, and the relative consistency of his eyewitness account, Hood questions how Bob possibly could have physically seen what he claims to have seen. Hood said he believes the police fed Bob information in an effort to connect Hood to the crime.\"There's too many loopholes in him,\" Hood said of Bob. \"Ray Charles could see that.\"A haunting caseIn the lobby of the Leighton Criminal Courthouse three years ago, Jim Mullenix, Hood's public defender at his murder trial, gave Hood a giant hug after the judge vacated Hood's convictions.\"This was the kind of case that haunted me for a long time,\" Mullenix said recently. \"I had to suppress the memory. It was a bad loss. I tried to forget this case for a long time.\"Mullenix called into question the statements, and truthfulness, of an array of prosecutor witnesses.\"They don't find any fingerprints on the car or on the steering wheel or seat or on the mirror or anything,\" Mullenix said.He also said the prosecution's key witness, Bob, was unreliable.\"A few years had gone by and he never went to the police? Why? I thought, 'Why would he make up this story?' Why? Maybe he thought it was his 15 minutes of fame. Maybe he told police what they wanted to hear,\" Mullenix said.And the other wild card in the case is the behavior of the police. Several of the police officers involved in the investigation have been under scrutiny in recent years for their tactics. Washington has claimed he was forced into his confession. Hood and Washington have separately filed federal civil lawsuits against the city of Chicago and police officers involved in the initial investigation, alleging their constitutional rights were violated. Hood and Washington allege the officers, including Kenneth Boudreau, a retired detective with dozens of allegations of misconduct in his past, fabricated evidence and coerced testimony. Boudreau, at a May court hearing in an unrelated case, denied ever beating any suspect he questioned.Much of the initial case centered on the statements of several people who told police Hood had planned a robbery, and Bob, who claimed to have seen him the next night in Morgan Jr.'s car. But many of the statements obtained by the police were written out for those interviewed. It can be difficult to discern the truth, especially since several of those involved changed their stories, sometimes recanting their initial statements and then later backtracking on their recantations.\"There's a lot of shenanigans that go on, and figuring it all out is a work of art and a painstaking ordeal,\" said Candace Gorman, a Chicago defense attorney who has represented clients before the Torture Inquiry and Relief Commission. \"And it takes a lot of luck to try to find people who are willing to talk and those who are telling the truth now.\"Gorman said it was not uncommon in years past for prosecutors to write out statements for witnesses or suspects, purposely adding lines that could be crossed out later in order to make the documents look more authentic. This practice also is mentioned in the footnotes of a 2016 dissenting opinion from the torture commission. This is less common now that interviews with suspects and witnesses are videotaped.\"I'd look at all of these statements with a jaundiced eye,\" Gorman said. \"Obviously, they're written in a way that is favorable to the case, in their point of view.\"Karl Leonard, an attorney who is representing Hood in his continued bid for a certificate of innocence, said that while many people have said many things over the years, his client has remained steady in his denial of any involvement.\"Tyrone has said every day since 1993 that he had nothing to do with this,\" Leonard said. \"The truth is stubborn and the facts are stubborn and they don't change. Lots of people say lots of different things. If you can focus on those kernels of truth in that noise, those are the pieces that are the most reliable.\"poconnell@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "154"}
{"content": "An analysis of 46 rare blue diamonds revealed how deep into the Earth these precious gemstones were formed. The analysis also revealed a new information about Earth\u2019s geological reactions. ( Pixabay )A team of scientists analyzes 46 blue diamonds to trace how deep in the earth do they come from and how exactly do they get their precious color.Blue diamonds or type IIb diamonds are particularly rare. The scientists said barely one-hundredth of 1 percent of all diamonds in the world makes it to the cut of being classified as type IIb diamonds. One of the famous blue diamond is the Hope Diamond that sits at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History since 1958. The Hope Diamond has ownership records dating back almost four centuries. It had been in the possession of King Louis XIV of France.Blue diamonds are tremendously expensive. The Cullinan Dream, which was sold at auction in 2016, was priced at more than $23 million. Fortunately, for the scientists, they were able to include this diamond in their analysis.The Mystery Of The Blue DiamondsThe study, published in Nature on Aug. 1, found that type 11b diamonds were formed deep into the Earth, at least as deep as the transition zone between the planet's upper and lower mantle. Interestingly, they got their precious blue color because of boron, an element that is found on the Earth's surface.To be exact, blue diamonds were formed deep between 410 and 660 kilometers below the surface. Some of the diamonds analyzed for the study showed indications that they came from a location deeper than 660 kilometers. The most common gems can be fetched from between 150 and 200 kilometers.If blue diamonds are found this deep into the Earth's mantle, how did they come in contact with boron, which was abundant on the Earth's surface?Solving The PuzzleThe team of scientists, headed by Evan Smith of the Gemological Institute of America, concluded that the boron seeped from the seafloor that was pushed down into the Earth's mantle through a process called subduction, or when one tectonic plate slid beneath another. The boron merged into water-rich minerals that crystallized after undergoing geochemical reactions that take place between seawater and the rocks found in the oceanic plate.Aside from finally being able to explain how rare blue diamonds got their color, another takeaway from the study is the discovery that water-bearing minerals can travel far deeper into the Earth's mantle. This is new information among the scientific community.\"This new discovery that blue diamonds also have super-deep origins, we now know that the finest gem-quality diamonds come from the farthest down in our planet,\" said Steven Shirey, one of the authors for the study.", "id": "155"}

{"content": "Aug. 03--SAN JOSE -- Swenson is developing a 260-room residential high rise with 1,039 beds, geared toward students, a block from San Jose State University. Named The Graduate, the project is Swenson's joint venture with Los Angeles-based Amcal Equities, a long-time residential developer. They broke ground last fall, and the project is expected to be completed in 2020.Swenson also has expressed a vision for transforming the area around the Guadalupe River into a world-class recreational area that could awaken new interest in San Jose.Amid a blossoming of potential for downtown San Jose, this news organization recently sat down with Swenson to gauge his views about the future of the city's urban heart.Q: What's your perception about how downtown San Jose is doing right now compared to where it was five years ago?A: Five years ago, we were just coming out of the Great Recession. Clearly the downtown has covered a lot of ground since then. We have probably had 2,000 residential units built downtown since then. There are probably another 1,500 in the pipeline. We are hoping to see more of that.Q: What has caused this increased activity?A: Office and residential rents are a little lower here in San Jose. Rents in places like Cupertino, Sunnyvale, Palo Alto and Mountain View have gotten so expensive due to a lack of supply. For whatever reason, those cities have chosen not to continue with housing development as aggressively as they have with office development.Q: How important is the proposed Google village and development to what you are trying to accomplish in downtown San Jose with The Graduate residential tower and other projects?A: We saw Cisco 15 years ago try to move into Coyote Valley, which did not happen. I believe it will happen downtown with Google, but it's still not a lock. If Google does come, there clearly will be many enterprise companies that will follow.Q: How much of an effect would Google have?A: San Jose is the technology capital of Silicon Valley, but for some reason, Google chooses to be based 15 miles north of here. But Google and BART coming to downtown would be a game changer.Q: What are the key uncertainties with Google?A: The question is: Are they preserving this property for the future, or is Google going to aggressively develop?Q: What is the next big thing that has to happen for downtown San Jose to take a major step ahead?A: It would need to be an enterprise company. Amazon has just moved into the WeWork space. That was a lot bigger step than just 20,000 or 40,000 square feet of offices. The fact they are here, and people want to work there, is clearly going to spur other enterprise companies to come into downtown San Jose. I thought Adobe was going to do it for us. Adobe was the pioneer. We are so thankful Adobe is here. But it's going to take one or two more tech companies to show that San Jose can be the technology capital of the world and that downtown can be the focus of that.Q: Would more tech companies in San Jose, including the downtown, help with the commute?A: People who work at Apple every day, 55 percent of them come from the south, places like San Jose. So more tech companies downtown and in San Jose would make it easier for people to get to work. There are really not enough people working downtown to spur all the retail and restaurants we want here. You really need the foot traffic to make all the retail work, all the housing, the medical, the restaurants; every single industry needs to be a part of the infrastructure that is already here downtown.Q: You recently expressed a grand vision for the Guadalupe River and what it could mean for the downtown area. How could the river area evolve in your view?A: The Guadalupe River is very underutilized, whether it would be for parks or some type of industry. A portion of those open spaces should be developed to a world-class level, parks, soccer fields, baseball, skateboard parks, kayaking, everything you could imagine in a recreational area.Q: What was the thought process that brought forward that Guadalupe River proposal?A: Really, the idea was to catch people's attention about the type of development that could be done at the Guadalupe River. This could create a place for people to go when they come to the convention center. They could go to the river walk in downtown San Jose. Many towns have river walks and they are very successful. People like to be around the water. That was what sparked the idea.Q: How much potential would a river walk have for San Jose?A: You could have an upgraded Guadalupe River generating $50 million a year for the city, and you could use that money to hire police officers, people to maintain the river park, even take that money to help house the homeless. Unfortunately, you have to sacrifice a bit of the natural surroundings. But you have to look at the big picture. Clearly, there is gold at the end of that rainbow.Q: Even before Google, do you see the start of a vibrant downtown San Jose?A: BART is the key for downtown San Jose. BART is more of a key even than Google. To be able to live anywhere off a BART line and get to downtown San Jose without your car would be huge. And you could combine that with Uber or Lyft. BART is what will allow all of that to happen.Q: By when would downtown San Jose be a major downtown?A: Downtown San Jose will be where tech companies, enterprise companies will want to be. Having BART get here by 2023 will change the market so much; office rents will change so much that it will make construction viable.Q: How serious is the problem with rising construction costs for both materials and labor?A: It's so serious that one of my vice presidents and I recently burst out laughing at one of the bids we got from one of our mechanical contractors. This is no disrespect to the mechanical industry. But a lot of those companies are running their crews seven days a week, 10 hours a day. We have iron workers on our Graduate job that have worked for the last 22 days straight, not one day off. Being an iron worker is one of the toughest jobs in construction.Q: How much have construction costs risen?A: It's been about a 30 percent increase since 2013.Q: Have you ever seen increases of this type during your decades in the business?A: No. It's largely due to the labor shortage, but it's also because after the banks loosened up after the recession, that allowed financing for a lot of projects that had been laying in wait.Q: Is it also materials costs?A: Absolutely. Steel costs, especially, have been on a tear. Lumber is going up because of supply and demand. So is drywall. There is just so much demand for these raw materials right now.Q: With the rising construction costs, how did a project like The Graduate get out of the ground?A: The most important part of that is it's a different type of project. It's student housing, with four bedrooms per unit, all within 800 square feet. So that changes the financial model by paying per bedroom as opposed to per unit.Q: Is that the type of flexibility that you apply to leading the Swenson company?A: If housing doesn't work at a location, what about office, what about medical, what about assisted living? I like to go into a different industry that isn't as saturated. Once you have the institutions come in -- the insurance companies, big finance groups, REITs (real estate investment trusts) -- and they are competing with the local developers, their money is less expensive than ours. They can add amenities, they can build a better product in the same area.Q: What will bring this construction crisis to an end?A: Less demand to construct buildings will bring about a change. That's what's going to move the needle.Q: Even with the housing shortage, even with the traffic mess, will tech companies continue to come to Silicon Valley, start here and expand here?A: Silicon Valley is the technology capital of the world. There have been too many bright ideas, there are too many great engineers. So many technology marvels that have happened here, started here. There are so many resources to be able to work with other enterprise companies to be able to fulfill the ideas of the startups here.Q: What was it like to take over the Swenson company, to start at the Swenson company?A: First, it was great to work with my dad (Barry Swenson). I was thankful to work with the team he had assembled. The knowledge that they all have is something I value very much. They had a 20-year head start on me.Q: How old were you for your first construction job?A: I was nine years old. That was hard work. I was a laborer and I wanted to be playing with my friends. On the other hand, making minimum wage at nine years of age was great. No bills to pay.Q: When did you know that construction and development was what you wanted to do?A: Junior year in college. When I got out of college, I had a janitorial service that I built into a real company. It was great to watch something like that grow.Q: What do you like the most about your job?A: Breaking ground. Breaking ground is like a miracle, it truly is. When you break ground, all the frustrations about this job, all the things I don't like about it, seem much better.------Case Swenson profileOrganization: Swenson company.Job: President and Chief Executive Officer.Residence: Los Gatos.Education: University of Colorado, B.A. Sociology.Age: 50.Family: Wife, two children.------Five things about Case Swenson1.

With the three touchdowns the team scored in runs, they also added a touchdowns-worth of home runs.After a slow stretch of hitting, the Dodger bats are understandable confident heading into the most anticipated matchup of the season.It is a World Series rematch and a potential preview to a second act. It is the Los Angeles Dodgers vs. Houston Astros. Opposing the Dodgers is the dominant Justin Verlander.Los Angeles got hot at the right time as they head into tonight\u2019s contest against the best pitcher in the American League. Luckily for the Dodger pitchers, Carlos Correa, Jose Altuve, Brian McCann and potentially George Springer may all be out of the lineup.While Correa and Altuve are both great, it is Springer that manhandled the Dodgers in the World Series. At least Yu Darvish isn\u2019t pitching.Here in our Dodgers Beat the Streak series we are concerned with LA\u2019s bats, who obviously extended our streaks last night. Both of our picks, Justin Turner and Brian Dozier, went deep to add a game to our streak.Sarah\u2019s pick \u2014 Current streak 2:My pick for today is Cody Bellinger. Last night Bellinger broke out of his slump in the most momentous way possible and Dodger fans couldn\u2019t be happier. I think that tonight, as the Dodgers face an old foe in the Houston Astros, Bellinger will be one of the guys leading the charge, just like last year.The Astros have been great this season, and there\u2019s really no way to ignore that. The Dodgers, however, seem to be just getting started and last night\u2019s offensive outburst may be their greatest advantage going into tonight\u2019s game.Jason\u2019s pick \u2014 Current streak 4:Justin Verlander has been so great all season long and pitched fairly well against the Dodgers in the World Series last year. Thus, I am going with a bat that was not on the team during the World Series and actually has the most hits off Verlander out of all the Dodgers \u2014 Manny Machado.Machado has not had a ton of success against Verlander, he is hitting .257 lifetime with seven hits in 27 at-bats. His nine strikeouts are a bit concerning.However, Machado did not join the RBI parade last night and has been ok at the plate for the Dodgers thus far. After seeing Brian Dozier slug two home runs in two games, Machado is going to want to remind the fans that he was the huge trade acquisition of the deadline.Machado is launching a ball into the seats tonight and I would not be surprised if it is early to get the ball rolling for the Boys in Blue.", "id": "159"}
{"content": "Aug. 03--The Bears exhibition opener was a tease for anyone hoping to see anything resembling what Matt Nagy's team will look like in the Sept. 9 season-opener against the Packers.Twenty-seven players (understandably) were held out of the 17-16 loss to the Ravens in the Hall of Fame Game in Canton, Ohio. The night, then, amounted to an early-August exercise in filling cracks at the bottom of the roster.Here are five observations from re-watching the NBC telecast.1. Isaiah Irving and Kylie Fitts were disruptive enough to generate optimism about the edge-rush depth.Let's be clear: Neither was rushing against the caliber of blocker they would face in a regular season game. The Ravens rested their top guys just as the Bears did. But all Irving and Fitts could do is win the matchup in front of them, and there were some encouraging plays.Each had one of the Bears' eight sacks. But the most impressive flash was Irving's strip-sack that was negated by his offside penalty. Because Irving jumped into the neutral zone on Robert Griffin III's hard count and then tried to get back onside, he was actually going away from the quarterback when the ball was snapped.Ravens undrafted rookie left tackle Randin Crecelius set with his hands low, which Irving exploited by swatting downward. That got him on the edge of the block, and then Irving did a terrific job to bend the corner and burst to Griffin.Yes, the penalty was a lapse of focus. But the one-on-one blocking win, albeit against relatively weak competition, is something to take forward as the Bears try to figure out their outside linebacker rotation.On Irving's sack on third-and-goal from the 5, he was unblocked because the running back ran into the left tackle, setting a pick that Irving used to get home without being touched. Not a lot to take away from that one from a technique standpoint.Another positive play for Irving: his stop of Griffin on a zone-read-option keeper at the start of the second quarter. Griffin had Irving in a bit of space and actually tried a spin move, but Irving was patient and closed down the space to stop Griffin for a gain of 2.On Fitts' sack, he beat tight end Nick Keizer, who's listed sixth and last on the Ravens' depth chart. OK, so that's not regular-season-caliber competition. But the sixth-round rookie won the block in front of him with superior hand placement. Keizer didn't have his hands up, which allowed Fitts to get his hands into the tight end's chest and bull rush him back. Fitts quickly shed the block and finished the sack.Fitts, too, was flagged for being offside on a play. But in terms of the pass rush, the first half offered something to build on.2. Receiver Javon Wims has an attractive combination of length, hands and speed.The seventh-round rookie showed -- on the national stage against inferior competition -- what has been evident in spurts during training camp. He's a friendly target because of his length, ball skills and competitiveness on contested catches. He's sneaky fast after the catch, too. He ran a 4.53-second 40-yard dash at the NFL scouting combine in February -- which is OK for a 6-foot-3, 215-pounder -- and appears to play with effective football speed.He lined up at times Thursday in the slot and on the outside. His first catch was a 7-yard reception from the slot on which he freed himself from the linebacker with a hard step to the outside before breaking in. That was a sign of route savvy, which is a focus of his practice work. He then caught the ball in traffic, one of several contested catches. Being able to catch the ball over the middle is a valuable trait, one that Kevin White, for example, is still working to master at the the NFL level.On Wims' 17-yard catch-and-run at the end of the third quarter, he actually was on the ground when quarterback Tyler Bray released the pass. Catching it while in the process of getting to his feet required great concentration, and then he showed off his burst by running for 13 yards.On the following play, Wims' 24-yard reception on a back-shoulder jump ball was one of the highlights of the night. Shades of Alshon Jeffery there. OK, let's not get carried away.Wims' shortcoming in camp has been drops, and he had one on third-and-6 late in the fourth quarter with the Bears driving to try to tie the game. The ball got on him quickly during an in-cutting route on which the defensive back was very handsy. Tough catch? Yes. One that would help Wims make the team? Absolutely. To Wims' credit, he converted fourth-and-6 on the next snap.The Bears are expected to keep at least six receivers. Allen Robinson, Taylor Gabriel, Anthony Miller and White account for four of those spots. They'll need some special teams contributions from the group, so pencil Josh Bellamy in for a spot.Of course, the Bears aren't stocked well enough to leave out any receiver who contributes to the passing game, so Wims can carve out his place by being consistent. Let's see if his performance Thursday earned him opportunities to play against better competition in upcoming exhibitions.3. NFL game officials must establish some consistency enforcing the helmet-contact rule.To be clear, some of the 15-yard penalties called by Walt Coleman's crew were for hitting defenseless receivers, although he didn't explain that clearly on every call. Still, the new rule prohibiting contact initiated by the helmet was a factor, particularly in the first half.Some of the calls were obvious. But there were other times when a penalty was warranted and not called. For example, a Ravens defender led with his helmet into quarterback Tyler Bray on an incompletion on the Bears' last possession. That was an obvious penalty, and not just under the new rule. It should've been a flag for a headshot against the quarterback.The NFL and game officials must use the preseason to closely evaluate how the rule is being enforced and strive for consistency. That's going to be the most frustrating part of how this affects games.It's like a baseball umpire calling balls and strikes: Hitters just want consistency so that they know what's what. The same applies to this rule. There needs to be a clear standard. The stakes are too high for there not to be. Those 15-yard penalties alter drives, which can directly affect the final outcome. Hopefully Thursday night is just a starting point.4. Coach Matt Nagy passed a minor game management test.Nagy's first time overseeing the entire operation didn't produce many telling moments. There weren't key replay or clock management decisions, even though it was a one-possession game. (Nagy does deserve major props for going for two late in the fourth quarter instead of playing for overtime in an exhibition game.)One game management decision did stand out: Nagy's choice to accept a 5-yard penalty against the Ravens for ineligible man downfield with 19 seconds left in the first half.The Ravens had completed a pass to the Bears' 47 to set up fourth-and-1. If Nagy had declined the penalty, the Ravens would've gone for it. The yardage was more important there than the down, and Nagy recognized that.It's worth noting that the Bears used their third and final time out after both teams lined up to run the ensuing third-and-16 from the Ravens' 38. After the game, he told reporters he called time out so that the Bears could try to get the ball back. But the clock wasn't running because of the penalty. That explanation needs its own explanation.5. The interception Chase Daniel intended for Dion Sims exemplifies the offense's growing pains.Daniel and Sims obviously expected each other to do something different on the turnover. Sims ran a short route underneath, turned to face Daniel but then drifted toward the sideline--away from nearby linebacker Kamalei Correa. Daniel threw to where Sims had stopped, and the linebacker caught it.Particularly noteworthy about the misunderstanding is that it occurred between a quarterback who is well-versed in Nagy's offense and their first-string Y tight end. If a starter and knowledgeable backup quarterback are breaking down on a simple pass like that, it's a good indication that a lot of work remains for the offense.rcampbell@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "160"}

Ahead of Saturday\u2019s enshrinement ceremony for the Pro Football Hall of Fame, the Bears will head to Canton, OH and take on the Baltimore Ravens.It\u2019ll be a special weekend for the Chicago Bears as a franchise, without a doubt. Not only will they be in the spotlight of playing in the first preseason contest of 2018, but they\u2019ll also have one of their favorite sons being inducted into the Hall. Legendary linebacker Brian Urlacher will receiver a bust in Canton and deservedly so.When it comes to the Hall of Fame Game itself, however, it won\u2019t be about looking back at the history of the Bears. Rather, it\u2019ll be about the first look about what this team has to offer in the 2018 season. With the arrival of head coach Matt Nagy and the second-year with quarterback Mitchell Trubisky at the helm, there are high hopes for this young team in Chicago taking a big step forward.Unfortunately, we might not see much of that on Thursday night in the Hall of Fame Game. Trubisky is likely to see limited action, if he plays at all. What\u2019s more, the likes of rookie Roquan Smith won\u2019t be on the field as the 2018 first-rounder has yet to sign his contract. And we can expect Allen Robinson not to see the field either.With that being said, there\u2019s still plenty that we could look for on Thursday, and here are three major ones for the Bears.", "id": "161"}
{"content": "Because most players using Discord as a social chat app, it has become a great threat to Steam, which owns the biggest PC marketplace in the world. Thus, in an attempt to get those players, it is offering a clone. ( Steam | Valve )Valve's new Steam Chat is its answer to Discord, the popular messaging platform that caters to different kinds of gaming communities. Needless to say, it comes as yet another attempt to compete with the chat app.Steam has now begun rolling out new text and voice features, in addition to an updated friends list. It is part of the company's effort to turn the gaming marketplace into more of an avenue where users can discuss games and interact with fellow players similar to Discord.The move does not come as much of a surprise, however. Steam's attempts to follow Discord's footsteps began this past June when it launched a beta version of Steam Chat.Now, those features have finally gone live. Steam attempts to regain some of the customers it lost to Discord after the chat platform had launched just three years ago.Steam Chat Rolls Out With Fresh Design And FeaturesThe new features mostly center on design and chat versatility. For example, users can now send GIFs and rich social video links to friends via Steam Chat.It is now also possible to sort friends by favorites, groups them by game or party, and maintain more dynamic group chats that are designed to look more like Discord servers. Not only that, Steam Chat now also allows users to take advantage of voice chat, much like on Discord.In short, Steam wasted no time making its own chat platform more similar to its competitor, and it has to hope the strategy works.Discord has become the default messaging platform for most gamers. Because it is so large, however, it is not just a games-centric app anymore but a popular social chat app in its own right, with public and private communities and group chats spanning 130 million registered users. That is an incredible number of people, which Steam would very much want to steal.The Steam And Discord RivalryWhy is Steam competing with Discord? It is already the number 1 storefront for PC players, so why does it feel the need to lure users further in with a chat platform? The simple answer is that Steam wants to be the default place where players connect, not just purchase their games.\"In 2011, Electronic Arts got flak after breaking away from Steam to form its own storefront, Origin. At the time, players feared a slippery slope of multiple companies leaving Steam, resulting in the need to maintain friends lists across a wide range of platforms. Now, Discord is where gamers' main friends lists live, not Steam,\" explained Carter Rogers, SuperData research manager, back in June.Simply put, Steam is jealous of the fact that all the players are socializing on Discord.It will be a real problem if ever Discord decides to launch its own storefront, as it will pose an even bigger threat to Steam. The company, however, does not indicate that it is going to do so, for now. Clearly, Valve is hedging its bets in case Discord tries to do something drastic because such a move will significantly impact Steam's user base for sure.", "id": "162"}
{"content": "NASA has officially announced the scheduled test flights for SpaceX and Boeing under the agency\u2019s Commercial Crew Program. Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX was scheduled to conduct its first crewed test flights ahead of Boeing\u2019s. ( NASA )SpaceX is first to conduct its test flight of spacecraft in a bid to meet NASA's requirement to transport U.S. astronauts to the International Space Station.SpaceX is scheduled to conduct first crewed test flight in April 2019 while Boeing is scheduled for mid-2019, according to a new schedule that NASA released Thursday. SpaceX Crew Dragon will blast off space via the Falcon 9 rocket while Boeing's Starliner will fly atop United Launch Alliance's Atlas 5 rocket. These new schedules, however, are both behind their original target dates.Meanwhile, NASA will announce on Aug. 3 the name of the astronauts assigned to crew the first flight tests and missions for both SpaceX and Boeing. The announcement will be aired at 11 a.m. EDT on NASA Television.NASA's Commercial Crew Program Target Test Flight DatesTo qualify for the project, both SpaceX and Boeing must prove that their systems are ready to begin regular flights to the ISS. One requirement is for respective companies to pass both uncrewed and crewed flight tests. If both SpaceX and Boeing satisfactorily showed that they can be of service to the space agency, NASA will certify them for crew rotation missions.For the purpose of these flight demonstrations, SpaceX uncrewed and crewed test flights are referred to as SpaceX Demo-1 and Demo-2 respectively. Boeing's meanwhile are Orbital Flight Test and Crew Flight Test.SpaceX Demo-1 is scheduled for November 2018 while Demo-2 is scheduled in April 2019. Boeing's Orbital flight test is scheduled either in late 2018 or early 2019 while its Crew Flight Test is scheduled in mid-2019.NASA Launching Spacecraft From US Soil Once MoreNASA granted both companies a combined $6.8 billion in September 2014 in a bid to push the United States' ability to fly to the ISS from the Florida Space Coast. The space agency has not flown spacecraft from the U.S. soil since its last space shuttle mission in 2011. Astronauts have since been flown to the ISS aboard Russian rockets launched in Kazakhstan.NASA's deal with both SpaceX and Boeing is two-pronged as the agency would also like to hire both companies for future leisure and business travel services to space. In fact, NASA's contract with Boeing and SpaceX include allowing both companies to sell tickets to tourists who would like to fly on the NASA missions.NASA To Announce Astronauts Assigned to First Boeing, SpaceX FlightsThere were reports that Chris Ferguson, a former U.S. Navy fighter pilot and a Boeing employee at present, will fly the Starliner for its crewed flight test. Ferguson piloted the Atlantis mission to the ISS in September 2006. He also commanded two more spaceflights in 2008. He retired from NASA months after flying the Atlantis shuttle on its last flight in 2011.There were also reports saying four astronauts that were selected back in 2015 will be the first crews during the test flights. These astronauts were Bob Behnken, Eric Boe, Doug Hurley, and Sunita Williams.", "id": "163"}

{"content": "Aug. 03--Lisa Brennan-Jobs, the 39-year-old daughter of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs whose difficult childhood has been the stuff of Silicon Valley legend for decades, is now sharing her story with the world.Scheduled for release on Sept. 4, Brennan-Jobs' coming-of-age memoir, \"Small Fry,\" is a story full of heartbreak and emotional turmoil, products of her upraising amid a tumultuous relationship between her mom, Chrisann Brennan, and her biological father who initially denied the girl was his daughter. Brennan-Jobs has been written about in Walter Isaacson's best-selling Steve Jobs biography and was depicted in films such as Aaron Sorkin's \"Steve Jobs.\"Grove Press, the publisher, is calling book the \"poignant\" story of growing up in conflicting worlds and dealing with the emotional ups and downs that come with having a famous and unpredictable genius for a dad. This is the first time Brennan-Jobs has written at length about her father, who initially refused to pay child-support payments to her mother. Jobs died in 2011 at 56 of complications from pancreatic cancer.The excerpt, published in Vanity Fair's September issue, opens with a literary rendering of Jobs' final days, presided over by a Buddhist monk who instructed a visiting Lisa to \"touch his feet.\" Jobs converted to Buddhism at a young age. Brennan-Jobs describes visiting her sick father every weekend and trying to fit in around her stepmother, Laurene Powell, and her three half-siblings.Here are some notable passages from the excerpts featured in Vanity Fair, a piece entitled \"Growing up Jobs\" that contains this teaser:\"Steve Jobs and Chrisann Brennan were 23 when their daughter was born. Lisa Brennan-Jobs remembers the pride and pain of a childhood spent navigating the vastness between her struggling single mom and Apple's mercurial founder.\"The Opening\"Three months before he died, I began to steal things from my father's house. I wandered around barefoot and slipped objects into my pockets. I took blush, toothpaste, two chipped finger bowls in celadon blue, a bottle of nail polish, a pair of worn patent-leather ballet slippers, and four faded white pillowcases the color of old teeth. After stealing each item, I felt sated. I promised myself that this would be the last time. But soon the urge to take something else would arrive again like thirst.\"The Monk\"(Jobs) was propped up in bed, wearing shorts. His legs were bare and thin as arms, bent up like a grasshopper's.\"'Hey, Lis,' he said.\"Segyu Rinpoche stood beside him. He'd been around recently when I came to visit. A short Brazilian man with sparkling brown eyes, the Rinpoche was a Buddhist monk with a scratchy voice who wore brown robes over a round belly. We called him by his title. Near us, a black canvas bag of nutrients hummed with a motor and a pump, the tube disappearing somewhere under my father's sheets.\"A Stranger in her Father's House\"Later, I would put everything back. But now, between avoiding the housekeeper, my brother and sisters, and my stepmother around the house so I wouldn't be caught stealing things or hurt when they didn't acknowledge me or reply to my hellos, and spraying myself in the darkened bathroom to feel less like I was disappearing--because inside the falling mist I had a sense of having an outline again--making efforts to see my sick father in his room began to feel like a burden, a nuisance.\"The Rose-Flavored Facial Spray\"For the past year I'd visited for a weekend every other month or so.\"I'd given up on the possibility of a grand reconciliation, the kind in the movies, but I kept coming anyway.\"Before I said good-bye, I went to the bathroom to mist one more time. The spray was natural, which meant that over the course of a few minutes it no longer smelled sharp like roses, but fetid and stinky like a swamp, although I didn't realize it at the time.\"As I came into his room, he was getting into a standing position. I watched him gather both his legs in one arm, twist himself 90 degrees by pushing against the headboard with the other arm, and then use both arms to hoist his own legs over the edge of the bed and onto the floor. When we hugged, I could feel his vertebrae, his ribs. He smelled musty, like medicine sweat.'\"I'll be back soon,' I said.\"We detached, and I started walking away.'\"Lis?''\"Yeah?''\"You smell like a toilet.\"'\"Not my kid\"\"In the spring of 1978, when my parents were 23, my mother gave birth to me on their friend Robert's farm in Oregon, with the help of two midwives. The labor and delivery took three hours, start to finish. My father arrived a few days later. 'It's not my kid,' he kept telling everyone at the farm, but he'd flown there to meet me anyway. I had black hair and a big nose, and Robert said, 'She sure looks like you.'\"The Kid and the Computer\"During the time my mother was pregnant, my father started work on a computer that would later be called the Lisa. It was the precursor to the Macintosh, the first mass-market computer with an external mouse--the mouse as large as a block of cheese. But it was too expensive, a commercial failure; my father began on the team working for it, but then started working against it, competing against it, on the Mac team. The Lisa computer was discontinued, the 3,000 unsold computers later buried in a landfill in Logan, Utah.\"A DNA Test and an IPO\"Until I was two, my mother supplemented her welfare payments by cleaning houses and waitressing. My father didn't help. She found babysitting at a day-care center inside a church run by the minister's wife, and for a few months we lived in a room in a house that my mother had found on a notice board meant for women considering adoption.\"Then, in 1980, the district attorney of San Mateo County, California, sued my father for child-support payments. My father responded by denying paternity, swearing in a deposition that he was sterile and naming another man he said was my father.\"I was required to take a DNA test. The tests were new then, and when the results came back, they gave the odds that we were related as the highest the instruments could measure at the time: 94.4 percent. The court required my father to cover welfare back payments, child-support payments of $385 per month, which he increased to $500, and medical insurance until I was 18. The case was finalized on December 8, 1980, with my father's lawyers insistent to close. Four days later Apple went public and overnight my father was worth more than $200 million.\"And Then This\"But before that, just after the court case was finalized, my father came to visit me once at our house in Menlo Park, where we had rented a detached studio. It was the first time I'd seen him since I'd been a newborn in Oregon.\"'You know who I am?' he asked. He flipped his hair out of his eyes.\"I was three years old; I didn't.'\"I'm your father.' ('Like he was Darth Vader,\" my mother said later, when she told me the story.)'\"I'm one of the most important people you will ever know,' he said.\"___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "166"}
{"content": "July 27--SAN FRANCISCO -- Hader stole headlines during the All-Star Game last week when racist and homophobic tweets that he sent out as a 17-year old surfaced during the Midsummer Classic. Now, he's heading out onto the road for the first time since the controversy ignited, preparing to pitch in a city that's known for being the birthplace of the gay rights movement and a bastion of liberal thought.\"This isn't something I'm really worried about,\" Hader said prior to Thursday's clash between the Giants and Brewers. \"Obviously, I've made mistakes, but hopefully, these fans will get a chance to know who I really am and not be judgmental about my past mistakes.\"After the All-Star game, Hader apologized to his teammates and expressed regret during a news conference, insisting the seven-year old tweets aren't reflective of the person he is today. When he took the mound at Miller Park Saturday, he received a standing ovation from Brewers fans, the type of reaction typically reserved for no hitters, milestones and farewell tours.But Hader will be pitching in an entirely different environment this weekend, facing hostile fans in a city that's known for its protests against racism, homophobia and hate speech. The response will be harsh when he takes the rubber in the visiting team's bullpen along the third baseline at AT&amp;T Park.Hader, who's entering the game with a 1.43 ERA and a 0.79 WHIP in 33 appearances, says he's ready for whatever Giants fans throw his way.\"I'm not really expecting anything,\" Hader said. \"Whatever they want to say to me, if it's good or bad, I'm ready for anything.\"I really don't know how they will react. I'm here to do my job and not let any distractions get to me, whether it's my past mistakes or the crowd.\"The Giants won't be focusing on Hader's past either. They're more concerned with chasing down the Los Angeles Dodgers, Arizona Diamondbacks and Colorado Rockies in the National League West standings than their fans reactions to Hader's tweets.\"I'll be honest, that's the last thing I've been thinking about the last couple days,\" Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. \"My thoughts: we need to get rolling here.\"___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "167"}
{"content": "July 29--NAPA -- \"I'd rather have a sack than a pick six any day.\"Maybe upon further examination, Irvin would take six points over a quarterback takedown, but the point remains: Irvin can't wait to show why he chose to switch from linebacker to defensive end. He's already started flashing why in training camp, even if the Raiders only have three full-squad practices under their belt.Without star defensive end Khalil Mack in attendance while he awaits a new contract, Irvin has taken the reigns among the defensive ends as he guns for his first single-season double-digit sack total of his career.\"I'm a seven-year vet, third year here. I feel like the stuff I'm doing, I'm supposed to be doing,\" Irvin said. \"They got me back at D-end where it's more natural. Less thinking, more reaction. Just me running around flying to the ball.\"Irvin wasted no time asserting his presence at defensive end on Day 1 of training camp Friday. He returned an interception for a touchdown against EJ Manuel, falling backward into the end zone with an airborne crotch grab a la Marshawn Lynch's famous celebration in Seattle. Later in the morning, he stripped Lynch of the ball during team drills and the defense recovered. Irvin then playfully punched Lynch after the play.If one thing's clear, Irvin isn't just honing his craft at defensive end. He's having a heck of a lot of fun with it, too.\"Bruce Irvin is playing his natural position on an every-down basis,\" Raiders head coach Jon Gruden said. \"I think he's a heck of a player.\"Irvin doesn't feel he's leading the unit any differently than he would if Mack was in Napa. Nonetheless, the Raiders still have a dominant veteran to follow even without their best player in attendance.\"If Khalil was here, we'd be leading the same way,\" Irvin said. \"We can't worry about who isn't here. Khalil gets tired, so when Khalil goes out of the game, the guys here have to go in the game and play while he's tired. He rarely gets tired, but when he does those guys have to be ready. We're trying to focus on getting these young guys ready. Those things will take care of themselves.\"He's working. I talk to him every day,\" Irvin said of Mack. \"He misses it, but you know how it is. He's working his butt off and when he gets here, he'll be ready.\"In the meantime, Tank Carradine has filled in for Mack opposite Irvin on the defensive line. We know who the starting defensive ends on the full-strength Raiders will be, though, and Irvin's early showing at defensive end makes his eventual pairing with the plenty proven Mack that much more enticing.\"He's had a tremendous camp so far,\" defensive coordinator Paul Guenther said. \" ... He's been a tremendous leader for us. I'm glad to have him on my side.\"I just think his best gift is going forward. That's what he should be doing each and every down. So instead of playing linebacker, dropping off in coverage, we have to utilize, really his and everybody else's talents, to the best we can.\"Irvin has publicly expressed his goal to reach at least 10 sacks in 2018. His previous single-season totals: eight, two, six and a half, five and a half, seven and eight. The Raiders were among the worst in the NFL taking down the quarterback last year, and a breakout season from Irvin in that department would do that much more to free up Mack on the other side.Now it's up to Mack's camp and the Raiders to get No. 52 in town, and Irvin to keep showing why he and the Raiders made the right call switching his position. If both happen, then the Raiders might just have something at defensive end the rest of the league should be scared of.___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "168"}
{"content": "July 30--Before anyone on the North Side dismisses Alex Rodriguez as a pot-stirring interloper, remember that A-Rod has been prescient before regarding Cubs pitcher Yu Darvish.In the midst of the Astros annihilating Darvish for four earned runs in 1 2/3 innings against the Dodgers in Game 7 of the World Series last Nov. 1, Rodriguez immediately tweeted that Houston hitters' body language suggested \"perhaps he was tipping his pitches.\"A month later, an anonymous Astros hitter confirmed as much to Sports Illustrated, explaining that the way Darvish re-gripped the ball in his glove determined whether he was throwing a slider or a fastball.Say this for Rodriguez: Love him or hate him as a broadcaster, spending 22 years in the majors as a player qualifies him to interpret nuances at the ballpark not everybody notices. So it figures that Rodriguez's controversial comments about Darvish's rehabilitation methods Sunday on ESPN came either from observation, experience or -- more likely -- an individual in the Cubs organization who maintains a relationship with one of the sport's most polarizing personalities.\"When you have a guy that signed an enormous contract and is sitting down and you walk in the training room and he's got two trainers working on him, you should be in Arizona somewhere getting treated,\" Rodriguez said about Darvish, seemingly out of the blue.Rodriguez suggested that Cubs teammates upset with the coddling of Darvish, who has missed more than two months with right triceps tendinitis, threatens to cause a rift in the clubhouse. During a nationally televised broadcast, Rodriguez gave voice to whispers that began locally shortly after the Cubs placed Darvish on the disabled list in May with the flu. He said something more unexpected than outrageous, wondering aloud whether Darvish's feelings were as tender as his right arm, a lingering question since the former Japanese star arrived in Chicago.What Rodriguez intimated rings true in every professional sport; injured players are best to stay away from the guys fighting through aches and pains every day to stay in the lineup.Unintentionally, Rodriguez also might have done Darvish a favor.The player best known for having a fragile psyche since signing a six-year, $126 million free-agent contract suddenly became the Cubs player most likely to be defended this week. Even if some Cubs quietly have rolled their eyes over Darvish or privately questioned the pitcher's approach to rehab, as Rodriguez hinted, publicly teammates will have his back. The winning culture created by three straight National League Championship Series appearances all but assures that kind of protection throughout the organization.The Cubs enjoyed an off day Monday, but the first time a teammate responds to Rodriguez's assertion, Darvish likely will receive the unqualified support he craves. Teammates typically rally around a player outsiders question. That's the way championship teams limit distractions. This gives the Cubs a chance to proclaim their faith in Darvish to anybody who doubts it, a potential boost of confidence for a pitcher who appears to lack it. Just look at how quickly Cubs manager Joe Maddon sprung to Darvish's defense.\"I totally disagree with that,\" Maddon said Sunday night after a reporter relayed Rodriguez's comments made during the Cubs-Cardinals broadcast. \"Everyone knows what's going on. We know there is an injury there. We support his recovery. Everybody in there knows and everyone in the coaches room knows also, throughout the organization. It's unfortunate that it was relayed that way, but it's not true.\"Cubs President Theo Epstein has sounded just as supportive of Darvish at every turn. The only evidence to the contrary came when the Cubs traded for Cole Hamels, a proven left-hander acquired to give the starting rotation stability the Cubs know Darvish no longer offers. The Cubs did the right thing in demoting Tyler Chatwood to the bullpen and leaving Mike Montgomery in the rotation -- for now. They would be wise to continue surveying the pitching market until Tuesday's trade deadline passes and not necessarily count on Darvish, who hasn't pitched in a major-league game since May 20. Anything Darvish provides at this point should be considered a bonus.Physically, only Darvish and his doctors can say where he is after a 23-pitch bullpen session Friday. Psychologically, the pitcher can get stronger by being portrayed as weak on national television. Nobody really knows how much of Darvish's rehab includes recovering from the shoulders up. What irony it would be if A-Rod's insinuations coincide with Darvish's improvement.So the Cubs can curse A-Rod now as long as they're willing to thank him later.dhaugh@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "169"}

I think a lot of guys can pick his brain.\"Contreras will listen closely to Hamels' preferences to accelerate the learning process as quickly as possible, and he doesn't anticipate the Cubs having four left-handers in the rotation being a problem.\"The most important thing is the communication and to find out what (Hamels) wants to do and how much he pitches to the scouting report,\" Contreras said. \"I think the communication will make the difference. I have to learn a lot of things about him, and I have a lot of questions.\"Hamels, 34, seemed just as eager to work with Contreras.\"That will be exciting in itself,\" Hamels said Saturday. \"We'll try to get our lingo down, our mannerisms and the anticipation of what we want to do.\"Hamels added that he often watched video of Jon Lester when he scouted a team he was about to face.\"(Former Phillies teammate) Cliff Lee showed me the way,\" Hamels said. \"I'm sure Lester and I can play off each other.\"mgonzales@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "170"}

People tested positive for the parasite are also 1.8 times more likely to have started their company. ( Pixabay )Toxoplasma gondii, a parasite found in cat feces may give people the courage needed to start their own business, as it appears to influence risk-taking and entrepreneurial behavior.T. Gondii Parasite And EntrepreneurshipFindings of a new study published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B on Wednesday, July 25, found that people infected with the mind-controlling parasite are more likely to pursue a major in business and to have started their own business compared with non-infected people.Study researcher Stefanie Johnson, from the University of Colorado, and colleagues said that the parasite could be reducing people's fear of failure. T. gondii is known to make mice unafraid of cats.For their study, Johnson and colleagues tested the presence of T. gondii antibodies in nearly 1,500 undergraduate students attending biology and business classes.The results revealed that the students who tested positive for T. gondii were 1.4 times more likely to be a business major compared with those who were not infected. Of business major students, those who tested positive were also found to be 1.7 times more likely to focus on management and entrepreneurship.The researchers also collected saliva samples from nearly 200 people who attended entrepreneurship events. They found that those who tested positive for the parasite were 1.8 times more likely to have started their own company.Johnson and colleagues likewise attempted to test for connections between the parasite and entrepreneurship on the global level.They analyzed the rate of infection in 42 countries relative to national surveys of entrepreneurial activities and attitudes. They found a positive correlation between presence of toxoplasmosis in the population and the rate of people engaged in business activities or have intention to launch their own business.\"While correlational, these results highlight the linkage between parasitic infection and complex human behaviours, including those relevant to business, entrepreneurship and economic productivity,\" the researchers wrote in their study.Dangers Of ToxoplasmosisDespite the seemingly positive effect of the parasite on people's entrepreneurial behavior, Toxoplasma infection can be dangerous. The parasite, for instance, can cause miscarriage and birth defects, which is why pregnant women need to stay away from cat feces.In a 2015 study, researchers discovered that the parasite can cause mental illnesses in humans such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. A 2016 study also found a link between exposure to the parasite and uncontrollable bouts of anger. Researchers found that Toxoplasma infection is linked to altered brain chemistry that can lead to a disorder known as Intermittent Explosive Disorder.", "id": "171"}

At this point, most fans have to figure that Ehlinger has the upper hand on winning the quarterback competition.Whoever does win the quarterback competition will have a short leash early in the regular season.

The celestial event will be visible worldwide.Stargazers across the world have the best reason to wait for the Perseid meteor this year as the dark moonless night will make the streaks of lights more magnificent. Astronomers say the Perseids may shower as much as 50 or more meteors per hour.In the case of most meteor shower events, the best time to watch is between midnight and dawn. The best location will be those far from the glaring city lights.When Is The Best Time To Spot The PerseidsThe Perseids is visible in the northern sky soon after sunsets during the month of August of every year. This year though, it has already been slightly visible since July 17.Perseids' best peak will be between the moonless summer nights of Aug. 12 and Aug .13, from 4 pm to 4 am EDT, according to NASA. Since the moon will be out of sight, stargazers can already see significant meteor showers in the nights and in the days that lead to the 12th and 13th of this monthThe space agency also suggests watching from a few hours after twilight until dawn to maximize the experience. Perseid will somewhat fade but will remain visible until Aug. 24.Perseid meteor showers have a broad peak because it happens while Earth takes more than three weeks to travel through the wide trail of cometary dust coming from the Swift-Tuttle comet. Perseid's broad peak is what sets it apart from most of the meteor showers.Sky enthusiasts in the mid-northern latitude will be the luckiest to have the best views of the Perseid meteor shower.NASA estimates that Perseids may shoot between 60 and 70 per hour at the peak.The Best Shower Of 2018Bill Cooke, a NASA meteor expert, said Perseid's generous fireballs this year, coupled by the moonless dark nights make it the best shower among all the meteor showers that will take place this year. Most of the meteors in the Perseids are as tiny as about the size of a grain of sand.He reiterated how the moon is seemingly working favorably with the Perseids. It will be crescent, which will set just in time before the Perseid peak after midnight, according to Cooke.\"The moon is very favorable for the Perseids this year, and that'll make the Perseids probably the best shower of 2018 for people who want to go out and view it,\" Cooke said.", "id": "173"}
{"content": "April 16--Compton rapper Kendrick Lamar won the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for music on Monday, providing arguably the biggest surprise as the awards for arts and letters were announced Monday in New York.Lamar is the first hip-hop artist to win the Pulitzer's music category, which traditionally has honored classical works, even after the category was opened up to jazz and pop in 2005. Jazz master Ornette Coleman won in 2007, but the selection of Lamar is the Pulitzer's biggest swing toward popular music.Lamar won his Pulitzer for \"Damn.\" -- the follow-up album to 2015's searing examination of race in America, \"To Pimp a Butterfly.\" Times pop music critic Mikael Wood heralded \"Damn.\" as the 30-year-old artist's graduation to pop superstardom. The Pulitzer committee praised the album as \"a virtuosic song collection unified by its vernacular authenticity and rhythmic dynamism that offers affecting vignettes capturing the complexity of modern African-American life.\"Finalists in the music category were \"Quartet\" by Michael Gilbertson and \"Sound From the Bench\" by Ted Hearne.Other winners in the Letters, Drama and Music categories included Andrew Sean Greer in the fiction category for his sixth book, \"Less.\" Greer, a novelist and short-story writer living in the Bay Area, wrote \"Less\" as the global journey of a man running from his middle-age demons.The Pulitzer committee called the novel \"a generous book, musical in its prose and expansive in its structure and range, about growing older and the essential nature of love.\"The National Book Review's Chiara Barzini wrote of the book, \"This is no 'Eat Pray Love' story of touristic uplift, but rather a grand travelogue of foibles, humiliations and self-deprecation, ending in joy and a dollop of self-knowledge.\"Martyna Majok won the Pulitzer for drama for \"Cost of Living.\" The play, which played at Manhattan Theatre Company, explores the lives of four individuals: a man with cerebral palsy and his new caregiver, and a quadriplegic woman and her husband.New York Times' theater critic Jesse Green wrote of the production, \"it would be a mistake to see 'Cost of Living' as an identity play about people with disabilities. Rather, it's a play about disabilities with people. In both of its stories, which eventually collide, the biggest handicaps are the universal ones: fear and disconnection.\"The Pulitzer committee lauded the play as \"an honest, original work that invites audiences to examine diverse perceptions of privilege and human connection.\" Majok, a Polish-born playwright raised in the United States, has seen her work presented at LCT3/Lincoln Center in New york, Steppenwolf Theatre Company in Chicago, the Geffen Playhouse in L.A. and La Jolla Playhouse in San Diego.Other winners: in history, Jack E.

(Photo by Tom Pennington/Getty Images)The Dallas Cowboys think they have found their quarterback of the future. But there are some major reasons to be concerned that Dak needs to learn to lead.The Dallas Cowboys should question Dak Prescott\u2019s leadership ability. More precisely, they should be concerned about Prescott\u2019s failure to lead his team in the past, present and ability to lead the team moving into the future.Without coming out and directly saying Prescott needs some serious growth as a leader, the Cowboys have sent out all the signs. The ownership group have sent the signals. The players have sent the signals.This does not mean he is not a leader. It does not mean that he cannot learn to be an effective leader. It means that right now, Dak Prescott is not providing the leadership an NFL teams needs from the quarterback position.The Cowboys need to begin proactively teaching Dak to be a leader. They need to set him up with a mentor. They need to put him in positions that force the team to follow his lead. If they do not, he may never develop into the leader they need.With his contract situation looming, the Cowboys will need to evaluate whether or not Prescott can lead the team. They will also need to figure out how to get him from where he is at today to where he needs to be to lead the team to the Promised Land.Looking at the signals the owners and players are sending about Prescott\u2019s inability to lead is necessary before suggesting a solution.", "id": "175"}
{"content": "The Calgary Flames announced the retirement for one of the greatest players to ever play the game, Jarome Iginla.It\u2019s a sad day. Not only for Calgary Flames fans but for hockey fans in general. Calgary Flames legend, Jarome Iginla, has officially announced his retirement. It seems like most hockey fans all over Twitter are upset about the news of Jarome Iginla announcing his retirement. The Flames will be holding a press conference at the \u2018Dome on Monday morning at 10:30 am MT with Iginla in attendance for him to officially hang up his skates.Not only is Iginla one of the greatest players to ever play the game, he\u2019s also one of the best players who doesn\u2019t have Stanley Cup. No, I\u2019m still not over 2004, thanks for asking.Jarome Iginla is ranked first overall in Flames franchise history in games played (1219), goals (525), assists (570), and points (1095). He is 15th in NHL history in goals and only one player higher than him on that list (Mike Gartner) also doesn\u2019t have a Stanley Cup. Iginla had 12 consecutive non-lockout-shortened 30-goal seasons and became just the seventh player in NHL history to achieve 30 goals for that many consecutive seasons. He also became the 20th player in NHL history to reach the 600-goal milestone.In 2003, Iginla was named to the EA Sports NHL Cover 03 and became the first black man to be on the cover of the game. On that note, he became the first black-Canadian captain of any NHL team and, growing up, he thought he could be a successful black man in the NHL because of seeing Grant Fuhr\u2018s success and, years later, would end up playing on the same team as Grant Fuhr.Not only were his hockey skills impeccable, it seems that many minority children also looked up to Iggy, like Iginla did with Fuhr. In fact, he mentioned in an interview with ESPN that he loves having children believe they can be hockey players because they see Iginla being successful in the NHL.Iginla will finish his career off with 11 Gordie Howe Hat Tricks \u2013 nine more than Gordie Howe himself. It seems fitting that his final game ever at the \u2018Dome (when he fought Deryk Engelland), will be capped off by a Gordie Howe Hat Trick.Good luck in the next chapter of your life, Iggy! The weather in Calgary will forever be -12.", "id": "176"}

Spoilers ahead!\u201cWhere\u2019s Alex? Have you seen Alex?\u201d is the most-asked question (and most annoying) in season six of OITNB, but what about the iconic duo, Flaritza? BFFs Flaca (Jackie Cruz) and Maritza (Diane Guerrero) are too much fun together. We love watching the two share the screen, they never fail to make us laugh. Their friendship is the best and often serves to cheer us up when the series gets a bit too dark and real. So, naturally, we missed them dearly in season six. Where the hell is Maritza? Is Diane Guerero gone for good? Is there no chance of a reunion in season seven?The Season 5 finale separated Flaca and Maritza. At the end of the prison riot, Flaca was put on a bus with several others we know, Martiza, however, was escorted to a different one. And while most of them were reunited (yes, Piper found Alex), Maritza is never seen again.As Bustle, sadly, reports, Maritza was transferred to another prison. But really, Guerrero\u2019s absence shouldn\u2019t be too shocking if you have kept up with her work. The Christian Post was one of the first to report Diane Guerrero joined Superior Donuts on CBS, questioning if she would be leaving OITNB. Scheduling conflicts on top of Maritza being on an entirely different prison, are the reasons her character simply didn\u2019t fit in season six.However, just as we once saw Natasha Lyonne\u2019s Nicky and Laverne Cox\u2019s Sophia leave the series temporarily before, we may see Maritza again.

{"content": "Amazon may want to go back to the drawing board for this one. A facial recognition tool the retail giant currently offers developers made quite the mistake in a test conducted by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). Rather than identifying 28 members of Congress as members of the country\u2019s legislative branch, the tool instead classified these individuals as police suspects. To make matters worse, a disproportionate number of African American and Latino Congress members were incorrectly identified, raising questions of how far racial profiling has embedded itself even in our machine learning software.Both Representative John Lewis, D-Georgia, and Representative Bobby Rush, D-Illinois, are well-known civil rights leaders and members of the Congressional Black Caucus, but rather than being recognized as elected representatives, these two men (along with 26 others), were falsely flagged as criminals. These mistakes occurred when the ACLU took Amazon\u2019s software to analyze images of all members of Congress against a database of 25,000 publicly accessible mugshots. This resulted in the 28 Congress members being incorrectly identified as lawbreakers, which represents a five percent error rate.\u201cThis test confirms that facial recognition is flawed, biased and dangerous,\u201d Jacob Snow, a technology and civil liberties lawyer with the ACLU of Northern California, told the New York Times.In response to the test, Nina Lindsey, an Amazon Web Services spokeswoman, said that the ACLU used the face matching tool (called Amazon Rekognition) differently from Amazon\u2019s recommendations. \u201cIt is worth noting that in real-world scenarios, Amazon Rekognition is almost exclusively used to help narrow the field and allow humans to expeditiously review and consider options using their judgment,\u201d Lindsey said in a statement.She further pointed out that the ACLU kept the tool\u2019s \u201cconfidence threshold\u201d at the default of 80 percent. This means that the group took into account any face matched as 80 percent similar to the police database \u2014 however, it\u2019s worth pointing out that Amazon uses the same threshold in an example on its website, showing how employees\u2019 faces can be matched with their ID badges. However, Lindsey said that in the case of police departments, Amazon recommends that a threshold of 95 percent similarity be implemented to avoid these sorts of mistakes.Amazon has previously come under fire for selling Rekognition. In May, 24 civil liberties groups, led by the ACLU, penned a letter to Amazon\u2019s CEO Jeff Bezos requesting that the software cease being sold to law enforcement agencies. The groups expressed concerns that the software could be used to surveil protestors, immigrants, or general members of the public, rather than just police suspects. Amazon employees, investors, and academics have since made similar demands of Amazon.For the time being, however, that doesn\u2019t seem to be in the cards for the web giant. As Amazon\u2019s spokesperson said, \u201cWe remain excited about how image and video analysis can be a driver for good in the world.\u201d", "id": "179"}
{"content": "Majority of those who were infected HIV in 2017 are women, according to a new report by the UNICEF. It sheds a light on the global AIDS crisis, and how girls are bearing the brunt of the epidemic. ( Darwin Laganzon | Pixabay )Teenage girls are significantly impacted by the global AIDS crisis, with around 30 adolescents becoming infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, every hour, according to a new UNICEF report.Out of the 30 hourly infections in 2017, about 20 were girls aged 15 to 19, which represents a \"crisis of health as well as a crisis of agency,\" according to UNICEF.Sure, there has been significant progress in the fight against AIDS in the last two decades, but the failure to prevent the disease from occurring among children is what's ultimately slowing the fight down, according to the report.The Toll Of AIDS Among Teenage GirlsThe epidemic's spread among teenage girls roots from a number of factors, including early sex, poverty, and lack of access to confidential counseling and testing services. An alarming number of teenage girls are also contracting HIV via forced sex, or being powerless when it comes to negotiating around sex.\"In most countries, women and girls lack access to information, to services, or even just the power to say no to unsafe sex,\" according to Henrietta Fore, executive director at UNICEF. \"HIV thrives among the most vulnerable and marginalized, leaving teenage girls at the center of the crisis.\"AIDS Death Toll Dwindling, But New Infections SurgeThe report says that 130,000 people under the age of 19 died from AIDS last year, and 430,000 were newly infected. Girls are bearing the brunt of the global epidemic, making up approximately two-thirds of both the new cases and the total amount of cases. While deaths for all other age groups have been decreasing since 2010, there has been no reduction in the mortality rate for teens. In total, around 1.2 million people belonging to this age group were living with HIV during 2017.\"We need to make girls and women secure enough economically that they don't have to turn to sex work,\" said Angelique Kidjo, a goodwill ambassador for UNICEF who contributed to the report. \"We need to make sure they have the right information about how HIV is transmitted and how to protect themselves.\"On a brighter note, the report does bear some slightly uplifting news. The number of new infections among children aged under 4 has dropped by one-third between 2010 and 2017, and 80 percent of pregnant women living with HIV are accessing treatment to reduce the risk of giving birth to HIV babies.There has also been some improvement in the southern Africa region, which has long been the supposed epicenter of the AIDS crisis.", "id": "180"}
{"content": "Texas A&amp;M football is 28 days away, and in the days leading up to the Aggie opener we\u2019re answering the 50 biggest questions for the 2018 season.Texas A&amp;M football is entering a new era of football with head coach Jimbo Fisher, one that will see them perform with a whole new offense than that of Kevin Sumlin\u2019s air raid offense.But one thing that is less talked about, even though his hire is considered one of the best of the offseason, is new defensive coordinator Mike Elko implementing a new scheme on defense.His philosophies might be a little different than that of previous defensive coordinator John Chavis, but it\u2019s definitely not as drastic a change as it will be on offense.But man does Elko have a whole hell of a lot of talent to work with.Texas A&amp;M\u2019s defense returns eight starters on defense from a season ago. They only lost one defensive end, one defensive tackle and one safety. They played a ton of young guys all over the field and it showed, but their experience is something that will be useful in 2018.The big strength of the 2018 team could be their defensive line.Senior Kingsley Keke decided to return for his senior season and it could be a lucrative decision for the Aggie. He was placed on the Bednarik Award watch list given to the nation\u2019s top defensive player every season. He was also given preseason All-SEC honors by both Athlon Sports and CBS Sports, among others.He\u2019s not the only one to receive preseason accolades.Landis Durham has also been getting some hype heading into the 2018 season. Durham tied for the SEC lead with 11 sacks in 2017, which was enough to earn him a spot on the Nagurski Trophy watch list, given to the nation\u2019s top defensive player as well.Keke and Durham alone will give offensive coordinators nightmares, but they aren\u2019t the only guys who could wreck havoc up front. Daylon Mack \u2014 who has so far yet to live up to the hype of being a top 10 recruit and a 5-star player \u2014 has re-dedicated himself this offseason and has the 2019 NFL Draft to think about. There\u2019s a chance he steps into Elko\u2019s defense and makes a name for himself.Then there is the Defensive MVP of the Spring for two years running, Justin Madubuike. The prize of the 2016 recruiting class hasn\u2019t gotten reps in the rotation yet, but Zaycoven Henderson graduating frees up playing time and he could be even better than Henderson ever was.Could this be one of the best units in the SEC? If each player lives up to his potential, absolutely. There is enough combination of talent and experience to be a force for Elko, and none of this takes into account the wealth of talent he has at the linebacker position, players that could drop down as pass rushers and make life miserable for opposing quarterbacks.The SEC proves how talented it is \u2014 especially on defense \u2014 every single year in the NFL Draft. Despite the fact that the conference is consistently loaded on that side of the ball, this group for Texas A&amp;M could be very special.Jeff Shull is the Site Expert for the Gig Em Gazette on FanSided.

{"content": "Aug. 01--One of the nation's largest sources of industrial lead pollution is just 20 miles down the Lake Michigan shore from Chicago, churning more than twice as much of the brain-damaging metal into the air each year as all other factories in the region combined.Only a Baltimore galvanizing plant emitted more lead during 2016 than the nearly 18,000 pounds released by ArcelorMittal's steel mill in Burns Harbor, Ind., according to a Tribune analysis of federal records that raises new questions about the oversight of big lakefront polluters by the Indiana Department of Environmental Management and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.The Burns Harbor plant also emitted 173,000 pounds of benzene during 2016, the newspaper's analysis revealed, making the sprawling steel-making complex by far the nation's largest industrial source of a volatile chemical known to cause leukemia.Lead and benzene pollution from the steel mill rose sharply during the past decade as airborne levels of both toxic substances dropped nationwide. More pollution could be on the way if Luxembourg-based ArcelorMittal, the world's largest steel-maker, ramps up U.S. production in response to President Donald Trump's controversial tariff on imported steel.Yet regulators can't explain where the steel mill's pollution ends up.On the days when lead pollution is monitored just west of the steel mill, levels are well below federal standards. A state analysis of local wind patterns suggests the toxic metal could be blowing north and west over the lake, toward Chicago, or south of the mill toward the Chesterton area.\"It definitely requires some work to solve a mystery like this,\" said Miriam Rotkin-Ellman, a senior scientist at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council who researches air pollution and reviewed the newspaper's findings. \"But there are plenty of scientific tools available to the EPA to figure this out if they want to use them.\"Industrial lead emissions, combined with decades of exhaust from vehicles that were fueled by leaded gasoline until the mid-1980s, can build up in the top few inches of soil and linger for years. Even tiny amounts of the toxic metal ingested or inhaled can damage the brains of young children and trigger learning disabilities, aggression and criminal behavior later in life. The EPA concluded years ago there is no safe level of exposure.Nearly 38,000 people live within 5 miles of the Burns Harbor steel mill, including 2,338 children age 5 and younger.In an email response to questions, the EPA's regional office in Chicago said it launched a computer-assisted analysis this summer to estimate where the steel mill's lead pollution spreads. The agency confirmed it has not looked for contaminated soil in nearby residential areas, unlike the testing it has conducted recently in two other Northwest Indiana communities where factories emitted lead pollution for decades.A key difference is the testing in East Chicago and Hammond has been conducted near abandoned industrial properties with well-documented hazards. It is relatively unusual for the EPA to sample soil outside factories still operating.Citing data from the monitoring station next to the Burns Harbor steel mill, where samples of airborne lead are collected every six days, ArcelorMittal said there is no evidence its air pollution exceeds regulatory standards or poses a threat to public health. The company has invested millions of dollars in pollution-control equipment, spokesman Bill Steers said in an email, \"and will continue to look for opportunities to strengthen these measures.\"Experts note that one monitor periodically collecting data can't fully assess the hazards of air pollution, in particular for lead and other metals that still pose risks after settling into soil and water.The Tribune analysis relied on data from the EPA's Toxics Release Inventory, an annual tally of industrial pollution required by Congress in response to a 1984 chemical catastrophe at a Union Carbide plant in Bhopal, India, that killed at least 3,797 people and by some estimates as many as 16,000. With a few clicks through the online database, anyone can find information about specific U.S. industries, factories and chemicals. The data can be ranked nationwide or by state, county, city and ZIP code.Forcing companies to make public their annual pollution data \"empowers communities to protect their environment, creates a strong incentive for companies to reduce pollution and helps companies learn from each other's best practices for reducing emissions,\" the EPA says on its website.During the mid-2000s, when residents of Chicago's Pilsen neighborhood wanted to know if metallic-tasting smoke rolling through the streets was dangerous, they turned to the EPA database for answers.What they found while scrolling through the list of polluters alarmed them: At the time, the H. Kramer and Co. smelter at 21st and Throop streets was the largest source of airborne lead in Chicago.Organized into a small but tenacious group, the plant's neighbors badgered regulators and enlisted academic experts who trained them how to use hand-held devices that revealed high levels of lead in several backyards. H. Kramer dramatically reduced its lead emissions after the EPA cracked down on the company in response to neighborhood complaints. As part of one of its legal settlements with the EPA, the company also financed the removal of lead-contaminated soil in dozens of yards near the smelter.\"It's a constant fight,\" said James Fabisiak, a toxicologist and director of the Center for Healthy Environments and Communities at the University of Pittsburgh, which in recent years has worked with other institutions to draw attention to hazardous air pollution from steel producers and other industries in Southwest Pennsylvania.\"Once you've got lead in the soil it can end up in people's vegetable gardens and kids can track it into the house after they are outside playing,\" Fabisiak said. \"That's why I would definitely want to know more about how far the lead from this particular steel mill travels.\"In contrast to the nearly 18,000 pounds of lead emitted by the Burns Harbor plant during 2016, about 8,000 pounds combined were emitted by 86 other industrial facilities in Cook County, the five collar counties in Illinois and Lake and Porter counties in Northwest Indiana.Lead emissions from the H. Kramer smelter had dropped to 11 pounds by then, down from 3,400 pounds in 2003.The Burns Harbor mill was built during the mid-1960s by the now-defunct Bethlehem Steel Corp., which leveled several ecologically important sand dunes conservationists were attempting to protect by persuading Congress to create what a few years later became the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. On its website, ArcelorMittal, the corporate successor to another conglomerate that acquired the plant during a painful overhaul of the steel industry, dryly notes Burns Harbor \"is the only steelmaking facility in the U.S. that is bordered on two sides by a national park.\"One of the reasons why the Burns Harbor plant is such a big polluter is it makes steel from scratch. The dirtiest steps in that process generally are baking coal into high-carbon coke and processing iron ore for the plant's blast furnaces.U.S. coke production has steadily dwindled as the industry has been roiled by competition from overseas companies and from domestic manufacturers that rely on recycled steel. Coke producers, including ArcelorMittal, also have struggled to prevent excessive amounts of benzene and other harmful pollution from leaking into the air.The last coke plant in Chicago closed more than a decade ago. In 2015, U.S. Steel shuttered the coke plant that supplied its century-old Gary Works along Lake Michigan between the Burns Harbor mill and two other ArcelorMittal plants in East Chicago.Many old-line steel mills now rely on independent coke producers such as Lisle-based SunCoke Energy. But despite promises of more environmentally friendly production, most of SunCoke's facilities are under court-ordered settlements with the EPA to reduce lead, soot and other types of hazardous pollution, including the coke ovens that supply ArcelorMittal's East Chicago plants.\"We keep finding these big sources of lead that have been ignored for years,\" said the NRDC's Rotkin-Ellman, citing a long-running battle to clean up suburban Los Angeles neighborhoods contaminated by a former battery recycling plant. \"The bottom line is these companies are poisoning our communities. Usually nothing gets done about it unless people start asking questions and demanding answers.\"mhawthorne@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "182"}

Let\u2019s not forget that Ed Dickson once looked like a star before Pitta did, while veterans like Dallas Clark and Benjamin Watson also played large roles on the team\u2019s offense during their short-lived tenures.This has prompted the Ravens to invest heavily in the position throughout their lifespan.

The Xbox Adaptive Controller is not a regular controller though, so Microsoft ensured that its packaging was also special.Shipping the Xbox Adaptive Controller in traditional packaging that would be difficult for gamers with disabilities to open will defeat the device's purpose. Microsoft consulted the testers who helped it develop the controller over its packaging, taking into consideration that some disabled gamers will use their teeth to open boxes.\"We wanted something that had multiple access points,\" said Microsoft packaging designer Mark Weiser. \"We learned loops were an important component factor. If you have low dexterity, you can get your appendage in a loop and get leverage.\"The result is packaging for the Xbox Adaptive Controller that features loops, different access points, levers, hinges, and ribbons that make it as easy as possible to get the device out of its box. The outermost packaging will have a loop that can be peeled away, revealing the main box. There will be tape at the side, and once removed, will reveal a strap that may be lifted to take out the controller.Microsoft has been testing the design over the past year with gamers with different disabilities, to make sure that the Xbox Adaptive Controller packaging is as accessible as possible. While disabled gamers may have family members or caretakers who can help the, unbox the controller, it is much more rewarding if they are able to do it on their own.\"We wanted to deliver an empowering unboxing experience,\" Weiser said.Xbox Adaptive Controller Release DateMicrosoft revealed the Xbox Adaptive Controller at E3 2018, with the controller for disabled gamers featuring two large programmable buttons and 19 jacks to improve the accessibility of playing video games on the Xbox One and PC.The Xbox Adaptive Controller will launch in September with a price tag of $99.99. There is no specific release date yet for the new Xbox One controller, but the groundbreaking device will surely be a hit once it rolls out.", "id": "184"}

This is part of a Shakespearean sonnet created by deep learning artificial intelligence \u2014 and, shockingly, it\u2019s actually pretty good. The bot was created by researchers at IBM Research Australia. Trained on around 26,000 real sonnets, it mimics the iambic pentameter and rhyming pattern of the poems most famously written by ol\u2019 Bill Shakespeare himself.\u201cWhile the application itself may not seem directly relevant to real-world applications, the underlying machinery of our model shares the same core algorithm that drives other problems that require generation,\u201d Jey Han, one of the researchers on the project, told Digital Trends. \u201c[These might include] translation, summarization, and chatbots. When we started the project, a research question that we wanted to address was, \u2018how do we build machines that can produce a coherent narrative that spans multiple sentences?\u2019 And we thought poetry is a good place to start.\u201dWe previously covered some pretty interesting attempts to mimic creativity using A.I. These have included everything from Google\u2019s DeepDream image generation project to a bot-written script for TV comedy Scrubs, which was then read by actor Zach Braff. While A.I. is currently in the process of munching up jobs in the real world, however, the researchers on this particular project think there\u2019s still a way to go before top-tier poets are put out of business by machines. If, indeed, it ever happens.\u201cThe conclusion in the paper is that we should focus more effort on \u2018content\u2019 in future work: Spend less time on rhyme and meter, and more time on emotion and readability,\u201d Adam Hammond, a University of Toronto English professor, who lent his expertise to the project, told us. \u201cI\u2019m excited to see what\u2019s possible, but I\u2019m very skeptical.

{"content": "On Tuesday night, the Washington Nationals won in the biggest blowout in Major League Baseball since 2007 when the Baltimore Orioles defeated the Texas Rangers 30-3, when the Nats won 25-4.The Nationals won 25-4 on Tuesday night but it was not without fireworks late. Nationals reliever Shawn Kelley allowed a 2-run home run to Austin Jackson to make it 25-4. When he gave it up, he slammed his glove down in disgust and he glared into the dugout. Understandably, most people with eyes interpreted that as a body language sign to Nationals manager Dave Martinez saying \u201cWhy am I in this game?\u201d. After the game, he admitted that he \u201cacted like a baby\u201d but he said that he was upset with the umpires.Whether that\u2019s the case or not, the Nationals apparently decided that they weren\u2019t going to put up with it and they decided this morning to, surprisingly, designate Kelley for assignment. Considering that he is one of the best relievers, if not the best, that wasn\u2019t recently traded (e.g. Brandon Kintzler) or injured (e.g. closer Sean Doolittle).Even with allowing three earned runs on Tuesday, Kelley has an ERA of 3.34 (it was 2.59 before) with an ERA+ of 128. He has an excellent WHIP of 0.959 as well as striking out 8.9 batters per nine innings compared to walking just 1.4.We even mentioned Kelley as a possible guy that the Rockies should look at if the Nationals were thinking of selling in this article from last weekend.He could be another signing/potential signing for the Rockies of a low-risk, high-reward contract. He is signed through the end of the season with the Nationals so the Rockies could give him a contract for the pro-rated minimum salary in the majors for the rest of the season. They did that with Santiago Casilla and still may do that with their former closer Greg Holland (who\u2019s DFA period is up on Friday). Kelley will most likely decline his minor league assignment with the Nationals in seven days when his DFA period is up and, thereafter, he would be fair game because he would be a free agent.If the Rockies were to sign Kelley and Holland, their bullpen could include some of these relievers who, when they live up to their potential, could be the best bullpen in baseball:Obviously, many of them have not shown their potential this year and some have been injured as well but if the Rockies were to get six or seven of these guys pitching well for September (plus a long reliever), the Rockies could turn their weakness into a strength.", "id": "186"}
{"content": "The stock market was in panic mode, Jim Cramer told his Mad Money viewers Monday. But no one ever made a dime panicking, Cramer reminded them, which is why the smart move today wasn't to sell, it was to buy. Today's weakness can be traced back to Thursday's stunning decline in Facebook (FB) , Cramer said, where the company saw a dramatic slowdown in growth and an increase in spending. While Cramer posited that perhaps management was trying to under-promise so they can over-deliver later, it seems, on the surface, that Facebook lost touch with reality. The reality is that Facebook's ads and services will be less effective and ultimately worth less if the company can no longer do anything it wants with its users' data. That will be bad for all of social media, Cramer said, including Twitter (TWTR) , but it shouldn't extend to the cloud stocks, nor the rest of tech. Cramer said there's still plenty of money to be made in the financials, industrials and especially the domestic retailers, which is why he'd be buying into the tech-induced weakness, as sell-offs like Monday's are just the type of cleanse the stock market needs from time to time. Let's Go Shopping  With the markets in turmoil, where should investors look for bargains? Cramer said to look no further than the biggest winners this earnings season. One of those winners is Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) , the semiconductor maker that's beginning to leap over rival Intel (INTC) thanks to a remarkable turnaround that's seen four consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. Other winners in tech included Microsoft (MSFT) , Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOGL) . Among the industrials, Cramer said he likes Honeywell (HON) , which is splitting itself up to unlock even more value, along with United Technologies (UTX) and Ingersoll-Rand (IR) . Finally, Cramer gave a tip of the hat to Expedia (EXPE) , which was also among this quarter's biggest winners. Coming up on this episode of Mad Money: Cramer interviews Evan Greenberg from Chubb Ltd.

{"content": "Aug. 02--The NFL's newly tightened rule on hitting with the helmet has roiled locker rooms and helped to fuel an impasse between the Chicago Bears and their top draft pick, who didn't want to be penalized financially for aggressive play.Many players say the rule, intended to curb vicious, injury-producing blows, will be difficult to enforce. Concussion experts interviewed by the Tribune agreed -- but said it's worth doing anyway.\"A devastating hit can lead to emotional problems, cognitive thinking problems and physical problems,\" said Dr. Larry Robbins, a Riverwoods neurologist who has pushed for state legislation to limit contact in high school and youth football. \"Some people never recover from a hit like that.\"The standoff between the Bears and linebacker Roquan Smith focused in part on the team's reluctance to guarantee that it wouldn't hold back part of his pay if he were suspended for hitting with his helmet. The two sides reportedly ironed out their differences on the issue, though other matters are still keeping Smith out of camp.The NFL has said that helmet blows deemed egregious and clearly avoidable will cause players to be ejected from the game. One example it highlighted from the 2017 season was Bears linebacker Danny Trevathan's helmet-to-helmet shot on Packers receiver Davante Adams, a blast that sent Adams to the hospital and earned Trevathan a one-game suspension.Robbins said a player coming in head first with a hard-shelled helmet is \"like a bullet,\" and that a single significant blow to the head can lead to problems that linger for years, or even decades -- particularly for football players who take thousands of smaller impacts throughout their careers.\"With the momentum these guys (generate) at that level, this would create some of those devastating injures,\" he said. \"Obviously (the rule) is going to be difficult to officiate, but anything like this is a great idea.\"The general consensus among researchers is that a series of subconcussive blows, rather than a single massive head shot, is the major risk factor for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, the dementia-like disease that has been found in more than 100 ex-NFL players.But Dr. Julian Bailes, a CTE researcher who is chairman of the department of neurosurgery and co-director of NorthShore University HealthSystem's Neurological Institute, said the danger of a big blow should not be underestimated.\"Anytime someone has a bad concussion or head injury, that can increase the future risk of brain degeneration, and even things like Parkinson's disease,\" said Bailes, who also serves on the NFL's head, neck and spine committee, though he was not part of the discussions that produced the new rule.\"All these have to be taken seriously. We have an incomplete understanding of how it all works, but you have to have a default position. Let's reduce the exposure to big and small hits as much as we can.\"While some players and coaches have wondered how the NFL will decide which head shots are worthy of a suspension -- only three last season would have produced that result, the league has said -- two Purdue University biomedical engineers say technology can help.Eric Nauman and Tom Tavalage have used helmet sensors to track the number and severity of head blows received by players on a high school team. They said the sensors can gauge the moment a player lowers his head -- a reading that could help referees who must decide a call or league officials who are pondering a suspension.More importantly, they said, the technology could help coaches eliminate such dangerous play during practices -- especially when it involves players who often escape notice.\"Nobody ever calls a penalty on the lineman for using his head,\" Nauman said. \"We would try to use some kind of sensor to try to coach those hits out of the game. That kind of technology would help.\"jkeilman@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "189"}
{"content": "BYE, BYE AUTONOMOUS SEMI. Just under two years ago, Uber bought Otto, a startup focused on developing self-driving trucks. Now, Uber is bidding adieu to its plans for autonomous shipping, at least for the time being. On Monday, the company revealed in a statement that it\u2019s closing its self-driving truck division.Uber\u2019s self-driving trucks were seen on the road as recently as March, where they were contracted to deliver freight in Arizona.ONE FOCUS. The move won\u2019t affect the employees of Uber\u2019s self-driving truck division \u2014 they\u2019ll just move to the self-driving car division, Eric Meyhofer, Head of Uber Advanced Technologies Group, said in an email statement to TechCrunch. The hope, according to Meyhofer, is that focusing all of Uber\u2019s self-driving expertise and energy on its cars will help that division build momentum.\u201cI know we\u2019re all super proud of what the Trucks team has accomplished, and we continue to see the incredible promise of self-driving technology applied to moving freight across the country,\u201d Meyhofer told employees in an email reviewed by TechCrunch. \u201cBut we believe delivering on self-driving for passenger applications first, and then bringing it to freight applications down the line, is the best path forward. For now, we need the focus of one team, with one clear objective.\u201dFrankly, Uber\u2019s self-driving car division could probably use the help. In March, one of the company\u2019s vehicles struck and killed a pedestrian in Arizona, and the incident put a halt on testing all self-driving cars nationwide.

{"content": "July 30--With Wall Street preparing to key in on Tesla's second-quarter earnings report on Wednesday, one analyst that follows the electric carmaker is getting a head start on telling investors what they should do with their shares.And that is sell now before it's too late.UBS analyst Colin Langan said in a research note late Sunday that he still expects Tesla's stock price to fall to $195 a share over the next 12 months -- a 33 percent decline from where Tesla traded at on Monday -- and kept his rating on Tesla's stock at sell. Langan said his views are based largely on uncertainty over Tesla's Model 3 production levels and the possibility the company will soon have to go to the capital markets to raise more funding.Tesla shares were off by 1.3 percent, at $293.41 Monday. For the year, Tesla's stock price has fallen almost 6 percent.In early July, Tesla said it did reach its goal of producing 5,000 Model 3s during the last week of June. However, Langan said \"it (is) unclear if the (production) rate is sustainable, as Tesla rolled out an average of 2,198 Model 3s a week during the quarter, and it finally produced 5,000 Model 3s in one week ,\"six months behind its initial estimate.\"Langan also said that there remains some apprehension about Model 3 price points, as current configurations for the Model 3 run between $49,000 to $80,000 per vehicle. Tesla has touted the Model 3 as its first mid-range-priced car, with a version that will come with a $35,000 sticker price, but which is still several months away from being on the market.\"The market should not ignore fundamental headwinds that persist with regards to Tesla's Model 3 profitability,\" Langan said. \"We do not see sustainable profitability in the second half (of the year).\"However, Langan said Tesla could turn a profit in the third quarter of the year \"if Tesla can average (Model 3) production of over 3K (cars) a week.\"Langan raised his loss estimate for Tesla to $3 a share from $1.71 a share, while Wall Street analysts are forecasting the company to report a loss of $2.81 a share for the quarter that ended in June. Langan's views on Tesla came a little more than a week after Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill cut his rating on Tesla's stock to sell, largely due to concerns about cancellation levels of Model 3 orders.___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "191"}
{"content": "Aug. 03--Two lawsuits filed Thursday urge a federal appeals court to force southeast Wisconsin and northwest Indiana to comply with the latest limits on lung-damaging smog, targeting a Trump administration rollback intended to benefit Foxconn Technology Group and a handful of other big industrial companies.The legal challenges -- one filed by Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan and Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and another by two Chicago-based environmental groups -- cite the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's own records and data in seeking to overturn the exemptions.Among other things, last-minute changes by Trump political appointees saved Taiwan-based Foxconn from having to make expensive improvements as it builds a massive electronics plant in Racine County, just north of the Illinois border in an area with some of the region's dirtiest air.The lawsuits also highlight the Trump EPA's last-minute decision to remove all of McHenry County, Ill., and Porter County, Ind., and part of Lake County, Ind., from a list of areas that contribute to chronic smog problems in the Chicago area.\"The U.S. EPA is ignoring its own scientific data in order to put industry profits ahead of the public's health,\" Madigan said in a statement.In December, all of the counties were on the agency's draft list of areas that either violate the new smog limit or add smog-forming pollution to neighboring counties with dirty air problems. By May, they were officially designated clean enough to avoid more aggressive steps to improve air quality.The changes were made by then-EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, who had challenged the smog rules while serving as Oklahoma attorney general and tried unsuccessfully to delay the more stringent standard from taking effect after joining the Trump administration.Smog, also known as ground-level ozone, is formed by a reaction between sunlight and pollution from car tailpipes, power plants and factories, fumes from volatile solvents and gasoline vapors. After a scientific review required every five years by the federal Clean Air Act, the Obama EPA tightened the national smog standard in 2015 to 70 parts per billion, down from the 75 ppb limit set during the Bush administration.Average smog concentrations in all of the Wisconsin areas initially targeted by the EPA exceeded the new federal limit during the past three years, according to state monitoring data. Smog levels peaked at 83 ppb last year in Racine County and averaged 75 ppb between 2015 and 2017.Although monitors in northwest Indiana recorded average levels just below the new smog standard during the same three-year period, an EPA staff report concluded that pollution from Lake and Porter counties contributes to air quality problems in the larger Chicago metropolitan area.The agency's career staff reached the same conclusion about McHenry County, where smog levels averaged 69 ppb between 2015 and 2017 but so far this summer have peaked as high as 91 ppb.Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican who has made the Foxconn plant the centerpiece of his re-election campaign, blames Chicago for making the air unhealthy to breathe in parts of his state.An EPA staff analysis of industrial pollution, traffic patterns and weather patterns concluded Wisconsin is at least partially responsible for its own smog problems. Documents filed with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources show Foxconn will be a major new source of smog-forming pollution.Without the Trump EPA exemptions, Foxconn and other industries in the affected counties would have been required to install more effective pollution-control equipment, scale back production or broker costly emissions-trading agreements with cleaner facilities.\"Cleaner air is essential to public health and a strong economy in our region,\" said Howard Learner, president of the nonprofit Environmental Law and Policy Center, which along with the Respiratory Health Association filed a separate lawsuit challenging the administration.Health groups note most of the country met earlier smog standards far more quickly and at significantly lower costs than expected.The Obama EPA estimated most of the nation would meet the new smog standard by 2025, with the biggest improvements in air quality coming from cleaner cars, trucks and power plants required by other federal regulations the Trump administration is attempting to unravel.mhawthorne@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "192"}

The Pacific Heights\u2019 chef\u2019s skills will be on display with fried chicken sandwiches with jalape\u00f1o slaw, along with crispy rosemary potatoes. 4. For vegetarians, the pulled jackfruit sandwiches at Southpaw BBQ are a must eat. For curious omnivores and flexitarians, the sandwich is so good you might not even miss the meat. 5. Another solid vegetarian option, Weinberg\u2019s Petit Marlowe will be serving up decadent truffled brie grilled cheese sandwiches with pickled snap peas.  6. If the fog rolls in, stave off the chill with some khao soi spicy tamarind pork egg drop soup from Bay Area favorite and Outside Lands newcomer, James Syhabout\u2019s Hawker Fare. 7. Another festival newbie, Ayesha Curry\u2019s International Smoke will feature a warming Dungeness crab tom kha soup, along with Korean pulled-pork sandwiches. 8. Festival staple Rich Table\u2019s savory porcini doughnuts are always a winner. 9. If you\u2019re a fan of Foxsister on 24th Street in the Mission, their stall is a must stop. While it looks like they\u2019ll be skipping their over-the-top kimchi nacho cheese dip (served with pork cracklings for dipping!), their offering of sweet and spicy Korean fried chicken wings sounds like perfect concert fare. 10. Last year, I couldn\u2019t get enough of KoJa Kitchen\u2019s super flavorful Kamikaze fries. Even cold, they were wickedly delish. 11. You could indulge in the decadent liquid chocolate bars from Guittard, which is celebrating its 150th anniversary this year, but for something sweet, cooling and lighter than air, opt for Powder\u2019s Taiwanese shaved snow.

{"content": "July 31--NAPA -- Yes, the Raiders' offense will need to bounce back to 2016 levels for the Raiders to contend for the playoffs in 2018, but the defense will have to make an even larger leap.That's where Guenther comes in.Even before Gruden took the Raiders' job for a second time this past offseason, he knew that Guenther, the longtime Cincinnati assistant, was going to be his defensive coordinator. And even though Guenther didn't accept Gruden's offer to come to Oakland immediately (he was in consideration for a promotion to head coach in Cincinnati), Gruden stuck with his pick.Why?To start, trust. Gruden is an offensive-minded head coach -- that's no secret -- so his defensive coordinator is granted a tremendous amount of autonomy. Gruden needed someone for the DC job that not only didn't need babysitting, but someone who could challenge him and his offensive players in practice as well.\"I think those guys are really close,\" safety Marcus Gilchrist said about Gruden and Guenther. \"Being that they're really close, I think they compete a lot. It trickles down to the players and it makes us even more competitive.\"The second reason? It's simple:\"I love the way the Bengals play defense,\" Gruden said at his introductory press conference. \"Up the field, single gap, get after ya.\"There was little to love about the way the Raiders' played defense last year. Despite having one of the best defensive players in the NFL -- Khalil Mack -- last year, the Raiders were one of the worst defenses in the league in 2017. Football Outsiders' DVOA rankings had the Raiders' No. 29 in overall defense and third-to-last in the NFL in pass defense. And those numbers came after an uptick in play late in the season, after Ken Norton Jr. was fired as defensive coordinator and John Pagano replaced him and attempted to morph the Raiders' two-gap 3-4 defense into a single-gap, 4-3 scheme.Guenther is tasked with taking that late-season progress and turbo boosting it.In Cincinnati, Guenther ran what, on the surface, appeared to the layperson be a basic 4-3, Cover-2 defense predicated on physical play on the outside and a strong rush on the inside.In reality, Guenther's defense is much, much, more complicated than that. Guenther has a reputation for being a brilliant blitz designer, and to dial up those blitzes, he reportedly has 14 different defensive-line fronts, 14 stunts and twists, 15 coverages, 20 blitzes out of a four-down front, 26 blitzes out of double-A-gap fronts, and 19 blitzes out of \"odd\" fronts.Heady stuff, no doubt. New linebacker Derrick Johnson called Guenther a mastermind of disguising defenses. At the same time, Guenther's defense is already being hailed as simpler than his predecessors'. Yes, the defense is hardly basic, but the responsibilities for each player are more straightforward, particularly for players in the box, in Guenther's' one-gap defense than in the two-gap system the Raiders' ran last year.\"The defense is like night and day to me, from past two years to this year,\" Bruce Irvin, who is moving to a more traditional defensive end role this season, said Sunday. \"Guys are flying around. Guys are doing less thinking. First day [of camp] we had five turnovers. All last year we had 14 combined... Less thinking and more reacting. Guys just playing football, not out there trying to figure out coverages and what each guy has. It's just guys lining up, in assignment, making plays.\"Guenther is facing the challenge of installing his defense without the defense's most important player, Mack, available. Mack is currently holding out of camp in an effort to land a new contract and there's no resolution in sight.That said, neither Guenther nor Gruden is putting much stock in the absence.\"When he gets here -- if he gets here -- he'll be an exciting piece to add,\" Guenther said.\"We weren't very good last year on defense with Khalil Mack,\" Gruden told NFL Network Monday. \"We've got to get a better pass rush, we've got to play better defense, period. And we hope Khalil gets here, but in the time being, we've got plenty of guys who need work.\"The Raiders are also without second-year rookie corner Gareon Conley, who strained a hip last week and is expected to miss a couple of weeks. Conley was poised to be the Raiders' No. 1 corner this season, but another Training Camp injury puts that status in question.Arguably, the Raiders are down their two best defensive players so far in camp. For another defensive coordinator that could be a big problem, but one of the reasons Gruden hired Guenther is that he's always been able to do more with less.In Cincinnati, he turned Vontaze Burfict into an impact player and helped author a late-career renaissance for Adam \"Pacman\" Jones. (Remember when Jones was a wrestler?)Yes, year-in, year-out in Cincinnati, the Bengals were one of the best defensive teams in the NFL and Guenther -- even while an assistant for former DC Mike Zimmer (now the Vikings head coach) -- was a massive part of that success.\"He's a great teacher, he's been able to get a lot out of players,' Gruden said of Guenther in January.If Guenther can turn the Raiders' defense into a similarly consistent unit -- hell, if he can get take this current Raiders' defensive roster (Mack or no Mack) and get the Raiders to play even league-average defense -- he'll put the Raiders' one good offense away from serious contention in the AFC.It's early, but early indications are that Gruden and Carr better have their A-game ready to go Week One.___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "197"}
{"content": "Over time, it can be easy to become overwhelmed by challenges or struggles and have a change in your perspective on life. Unfortunately, focusing too much on the negative can make it difficult to appreciate life. Many people begin to form a habit of focusing too much on what isn\u2019t going right rather than appreciate the positive.Your mindset and thoughts will ultimately influence your joy in life, which determines what you appreciate. If you fail to focus on the moment you\u2019re living in, it can become easy to get stuck in a rut.      If you want to remain thankful, there are a few essential tips to follow on how to live in the moment.1. Remain ThankfulMany people have a habit of focusing too much on the negative rather than realizing what they have in life, which can make it difficult to appreciate everything. Make it a point to remain thankful by creating a list of how you\u2019re blessed, whether it\u2019s due to your career, your family, or your health. Practicing gratitude is essential for remaining positive and feeling happier.2. Let Go of the PastIt can be challenging to live in the present and feel joyful if you\u2019re reliving moments from the past. Whether you experienced trauma or loss, the experiences can affect your present life if you allow them to influence your current mood. Allow yourself to let go of the past and instead focus on what you learned. Understand that pain is a part of life that doesn\u2019t have to dictate how much you appreciate each day. Choose to have hope for the future and dream of the possibilities.     3. Avoid Postponing GratificationAs an adult, it can be easy to postpone gratification and put your happiness on the backburner. Instead of waiting to feel happy or fulfilled, you can allow yourself to have fun and enjoy life by participating in activities that you enjoy today instead of waiting until tomorrow. Allow yourself to have fun, spend time with loved ones, and eat delicious food on a daily basis.4. Focus on the PresentOne of the best ways to combat fear and avoid worrying about the future is to focus on the present. Become more conscious about focusing on the present and your current feelings to ensure that you enjoy life. By cherishing each moment that you experience, you can feel more fulfilled and rich instead of placing your focus on the future, which isn\u2019t guaranteed.5. Become Self-AwareLiving in the present will require you to become self-aware. Evaluate your feelings and thoughts to determine what influence what you experience each day. Understand that you\u2019ve reached where you\u2019re at due to your decisions and who you are as an individual. Your decisions and choices have ultimately determined your current state. If you want to accomplish more or change directions in the future, you\u2019ll need to begin to make different choices for yourself.     6. Lose Track of TimeLosing track of time will also prove to be beneficial when you get into the flow of an activity or hobby that you\u2019re enjoying. By spending time enjoying various activities or tasks, you can lose track of time and avoid spending too much time processing your thoughts, which can allow you to be present. Try new tasks that allow you to be in an elusive state, which can enhance the quality of your day and make it possible to appreciate life.7. Practice MindfulnessStart by practicing mindfulness each day, which can reduce your stress levels and make it possible to avoid anxiety if you appreciate the current moment. Mindfulness means focusing on your immediate experience and taking in both the good and the bad with complete acceptance of it.8. DisconnectDisconnecting from tehcnology is vital to ensure that you can remain present and avoid spending all of your time online. Spend a few hours each day by unplugging from your phone and computer.9. Spend Time with Loved OnesStudies show that spending time with family members or friends can allow you to relax and will also improve your mood by laughing and feeling supported by those you trust. By making conversation and spending time in a joyful setting, you can create new memories and appreciate life more.Find a job that you truly enjoy to ensure that you spend most of your time practicing your passion or making a difference in your community. The quality of your job will impact how fulfilled you feel long-term.Living in the moment doesn\u2019t have to be impossible after you\u2019ve formed many habits of living too much in the past or future. With the right steps taken, you can change your perspective and learn how to focus more on the now, which will prove to be fulfilling.", "id": "198"}
{"content": "NEW YORK, NY \u2013 MARCH 26: (l-r) Rob O\u2019GaraAssuming no further moves, the New York Rangers will enter training camp with a plethora of centers. Seeing as they cannot all line up down the middle, where might they play this season?The New York Rangers have a nice problem to have on their hands for once. They will enter the 2018-19 with an abundance of centers, each looking to claim and establish their spot in the lineup.Barring any further roster movement, the Rangers have at least six players on their roster who can line up at center. Mika Zibanejad is the presumptive number one center, but the depth chart beyond him is far from set.Assuming Kevin Hayes and Ryan Spooner are re-signed, they, along with Lias Andersson and Filip Chytil are expected to compete for the second and third line center spots. There is also a distant chance that Brett Howden could force himself into the conversation, much like Chytil did last season.A position that was an area of weakness, as recently as last season, now has the potential to be a pillar of strength for the Rangers within a few seasons. If that is to become reality, the first steps towards achieving that goal will begin next season.", "id": "199"}

{"content": "Aug. 01--If \"mindfulness\" wasn't on your 2018 New Year's resolution list, you're doing it wrong. It seems to be the self-help buzzword of the year -- and science backs it up.In 2005, the National Center for Biotechnology Information studied the brains of 20 people who regularly meditated and found the layers of the cerebral cortex was thicker than in nonmediators. A thicker cortex is associated with greater cognitive ability and intelligence in general.According to the book \"Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Depression,\" written by a trio of doctors specializing in mood disorders, clinical psychology and brain sciences, not only does mindfulness help combat a variety of physical and mental health conditions such as depression, it's specifically helpful in combating the recurrence of these issues.Mindfulness is a form of meditation with more emphasis on being immersed in the present moment rather than focusing on a particular subject. It's grown into a multibillion dollar industry that includes apps, books, workshops, retreats, coaches and classes -- the latter of which can be great for those in need of a little guidance. And with several failed self-guided attempts in my past, I decided to give it a shot.What's the deal?Chill Chicago markets itself as a space for \"incense-free modern meditation\" and \"no-need-to-get-naked massages.\" The interior looks like a spa -- it's quiet and modern with neutral colored walls and details. The front sitting room leads to an area with massage stations and two studios where classes take place.Chill has several types of classes, including Rest, which is held at night and focuses on transitioning from stress to sleep. The Breath class uses the lungs as an anchor point for staying in the present moment. Out-of-town wellness retreats, as well as workshops that range from helping cancer patients and their caregivers to combating screen addiction, are also offered.I opted for Insight, a class centered on awareness of the thoughts, ideas and beliefs that are consuming brain space.It was a lunchtime class with only three other people, all of whom were dressed in casual attire or work clothes -- I was in workout gear. There were no yoga mats or windows in the studio, which would fit around 20 people at capacity, and only candle lighting and large cushions with pillows and blankets to sit on.The instructor started off by explaining that for 30 minutes we'd go through breathing, sitting, checking-in and simply being.We'd use around 10 long breaths to focus, then sit with our thoughts. He urged us to not blindly bounce from thought to thought, but rather recognize exactly what we were thinking about and why -- and maybe even think deeper into it. At other points in the class, we'd think about our heartbeats and try to manipulate our brains into feeling the beats in our hands and heads.How hard was it, really?I have never really been able to meditate. I've tried audio meditation, yoga classes, even a food-based meditation practice -- nothing worked. I'm a fast-thinking, multi-tasking ruminator, and the closest I've come to single thought during a workout or class is exhaustion while running on the treadmill. Not exactly Zen.But in the class, given the novelty of the space and the experience, I found it surprisingly easy to close my eyes and think about where I was and what it felt like.Only twice did I think about what I had planned after work or what I'd eat for dinner, which is more than I can say for any of my self-meditation attempts. When my mind did wander, the instructor was there reminding us to check in with the thought, explore it briefly, then refocus on the present moment.While some classes are good for things like regulating emotions, improving your sex life and exploring dreams, Insight was focused on self-reflection, sorting through issues and finding self-awareness.I felt a sense of peace after the class and maybe for a few hours after, but I'm not sure how long it lasted. I'm told this is normal -- mindfulness is something you have to practice. But every moment of peace counts in this noisy, stress-inducing city.What's the cost, and who should go?Anyone can find mindfulness useful -- no physical fitness required, no age limit, just a brain. If your'e in search of healing for a more specific purpose -- trauma, mental health concerns, etc. -- consider doing research or scheduling a consultation to find the right type of mindfulness practice.I thought of the session as a sort of therapy or workout for the mind. So if you're not looking to delve into counseling, mindfulness may be a good alternative.I'd considering attending a regular class, especially if money were no object -- mostly because the guided approach was so much more effective than trying to focus my scattered brain alone.One-time core classes at Chill Chicago (Breath, Insight, Rest, or Yoga and Meditation) cost $22. A $150 monthly membership includes unlimited core classes and use of recorded meditation, as well as a discount on massages, retail, retreats and workshops. Chill Chicago is also available through ClassPass.There are a number of places that offer guided meditation throughout the city, ranging from four-week courses to psychotherapy. Hosts include doctors, churches, life coaches and beyond.Chill Chicago is at 222 W.

{"content": "General Motors (GM) executives expect the company's business in China to remain strong during a tumultuous 2018. GM executive vice president and chief financial officer Chuck Stevens noted that in response to a question from Adam Jonas, a Morgan Stanley analyst. Jones had asked whether GM executives see business prospects in China souring as a result of a U.S.-China trade war.   \"We have not seen any of that yet,\" Stevens said. \"It starts with the very strong relationship with our partner, but we haven't see anything yet.\"   GM China delivered more than 858,000 vehicles in the second quarter and first-half deliveries rose 4.4%. The Baojun and Cadillac achieved sales increases of 6% and 19% respectively, while Chevrolet sales grew 22%, according to GM earnings results.   In the second half of the year, GM China will introduce 10 new models, including the Cadillac XT4. The focus is on high-demand segments, including SUVs and luxury vehicles. Pricing pressure might increase because of competitive launches, executives said.   CEO Mary Barra said a potential trade war would not deter the company from building cars in China.   \"Our general strategy is (to) build where we sell. We have a lot of manufacturing capability in China,\" Barra said.   General Motors stock traded lower on Wednesday on news of a tightened earnings and margins forecast this year because of rising commodity prices and currency depreciation in Brazil and South America. Shares were down 5.6% to $37.25 as of 2:45 p.m. ET.  The company beat Wall Street earning expectations but revised 2018 adjusted earnings per share to $6, below the $6.30 to $6.60 earnings guidance the company previous provided.   Morgan Stanley issued an overweight rating and set a $50 price target for the automaker's stock.   \"Our OW thesis is based on the opportunity for the company to change the prevailing investment narrative around its place in Auto 2.0, its ability to partner with tech firms in profitable ways and to achieve a positive terminal value in many of its key businesses,\" Jonas said.   Operating cash flow was projected to be $11.5 billion for the year.   Second-quarter North American revenue was $2.7 billion, down from $3.5 billion year-over-year with a margin of 9.4%, reflecting the negative impact of pricier commodities on production.   \"We faced significant external challenges, but delivered solid results this quarter,\" Barra said. \"The fundamentals of our business are strong and we remain focused on our plan -- delivering great vehicles, developing technologies to transform personal mobility and creating long-term shareholder value.\"   Stocks in the auto sector have trailed off in the past several months on trade war gamesmanship and uncertainty around tariffs.   JPMorgan Chase North American Equity Research predicted a negative reaction for GM shares based on the lower-than-expected profits and the commodity prices and currency effects in South America.   However, some bright spots for GM include its record income in China and a revaluation of GM's stake in Lyft.   President Donald Trump was set to meet with European Union president Jean Claude Juncker to discuss a possible trade deal. Trump is expected to insist that steel and aluminum tariffs being imposed on American imports are necessary to protect the nation's economic interest.   Last Thursday, foreign and domestic automakers presented a united front in warning the U.S. Trade Commission that Trump's plan to impose tariffs on $300 billion in foreign auto imports would harm the industry.", "id": "205"}
{"content": "July 27--An appeals court on Friday said Donald Trump supporters can move ahead with a lawsuit claiming San Jose police forced them to walk from a 2016 campaign rally into a mob of violent protesters who assaulted them while the officers stood by.The city had argued the case should be dismissed because the officers enjoy \"qualified immunity\" from liability in doing their jobs.But a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a district court ruling last year in favor of more than a dozen rally attendees who alleged the officers violated their civil rights.\"We find the officers violated clearly established rights and are not entitled to qualified immunity at this stage of the proceedings,\" said the opinion by Judge Dorothy W. Nelson, joined by judges Andrew J. Kleinfeld and William A. Fletcher.City Attorney Rick Doyle said \"we're reviewing the decision\" and will discuss next steps with the City Council. Those could include asking a full 11-member panel of the 9th Circuit to review the decision or appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court, he said.The lawsuit, Hernandez v. San Jose, involved a June 2, 2016 campaign rally for then-candidate Trump at San Jose's McEnery Convention Center.\"The attendees alleged sufficiently that the officers increased the danger to them by shepherding them into a crowd of violent protesters and that the officers acted with deliberate indifference to that danger,\" the 9th Circuit opinion said. \"The district court therefore correctly denied the officers qualified immunity.\"The suit initially named Mayor Sam Liccardo and Police Chief Eddie Garcia as defendants. But U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh last year dismissed claims against Garcia. The attendees dropped claims against Liccardo in November 2016.The suit proceeds against seven named city officers. But the 9th Circuit opinion did not uphold liability claims against the city itself that were based on the assertion that the police chief, in comments supporting his officers after the rally, effectively ratified their allegedly unconstitutional conduct.\"We decline to exercise jurisdiction over it,\" the court opinion said, because \"the city's liability is not inextricably intertwined with the officers' liability\" and \"the qualified immunity issue.\"___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "206"}

{"content": "April 16--When the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California voted to finance the lion's share of the delta tunnels project, some on the board called it a bold stroke of leadership.The delegations from Los Angeles and San Diego, however, called the move alarming, financially risky and irresponsible.MWD's two largest member agencies, L.A. and the San Diego County Water Authority, were on the losing end of last week's vote to invest nearly $11 billion in the construction of two massive tunnels under the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta.\"This vote was honestly quite divisive,\" Los Angeles board member Mark Gold said. \"The Metropolitan Water District is basically subsidizing benefits for the entire state of California over and above the 19 million customers that Met has in Southern California. ... To have local ratepayers incur that risk is inappropriate and potentially illegal.\"State constitutional provisions requiring local government fees to be proportional to the services provided could leave MWD vulnerable to court challenges, Gold and others warn.According to MWD, financing the twin tunnels would add an average of $60 a year to household water rates across the Southland. But local purchases of agency supplies vary, meaning costs will too.The board vote amounted to an 11th-hour rescue of the massive project, known as California WaterFix, which was floundering over the issue of who would pay to revamp the linchpin of the state's water delivery system.Backers worried that a plan to downsize the project to one tunnel would drag out the permitting process beyond the end of the year, when Gov. Jerry Brown -- WaterFix's chief political cheerleader -- would be out of office. His successor might not be so enthusiastic about the tunnels, which are opposed by delta interests and major environmental groups.Brown played that card in a last-minute appeal to the MWD board. Moving ahead with just one tunnel would \"risk serious delay ... and jeopardize the entire project,\" he wrote to the directors on the eve of the vote.\"That resonated with my board very strongly,\" MWD general manager Jeff Kightlinger said.In a measure of how complex -- and contentious -- debate was ahead of the vote, Kightlinger's staff issued conflicting signals on the project.The staff formally recommended that the agency press ahead with one tunnel because bankrolling the full project entailed more financial risk. And a staff analysis concluded that twin tunnels would not send more water to the Southland than a single one.But the staff also said twin tunnels would provide more overall benefits, with greater flexibility in operating the delta export operations, additional water quality improvements and the capacity to transfer water purchases above and beyond MWD's regular deliveries.\"There are multiple values in it that would accrue to MWD,\" and the extra investment would not violate the law, Kightlinger said.The project's original funding scheme collapsed last fall, when the San Joaquin Valley agriculture districts that were supposed to pick up nearly half of the $17-billion tab backed out. That prompted the state to shrink the proposal to a cheaper, one-tunnel version that would be financed by MWD and the other, mostly urban districts that get State Water Project deliveries from the delta.Under that scenario, WaterFix would move ahead in stages, with a second tunnel built when financing materialized. Not long after the downsizing proposal emerged, MWD started talking about picking up agriculture's unfunded portion, with the assumption that the agency could recoup the extra cost by selling tunnel capacity to growers after the project is built.But there is no guarantee agricultural districts will buy tunnel supplies -- or if they do, that they will pay a price that reflects the water's true cost.\"I will be shocked if ag water users paid their fair share of the tunnels,\" said Doug Obegi, an attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group. \"It doesn't make economic sense for them.\"He called the board's approval of an $11-billion stake in the project \"an act of desperation ... subsidize everyone else, or you don't get your tunnels.\"To some extent, the board split reflected different levels of dependence on the imported supplies that Metropolitan wholesales to the Southland.The San Diego authority has spent the last two decades trying to wean itself from MWD supplies and repeatedly has tangled with the agency over rate setting and other policies.L.A., which gets water from the Owens Valley as well as MWD, has embarked on a campaign to develop more local supplies and cut its MWD purchases.That led to sniping during last week's board debate, when chairman Randy Record, who represents parts of Riverside County, implied that L.A. was just looking out for itself.\"That comment was not very well received\" by the L.A. delegation, said Gold, who expressed concerns that the tunnel fight will leave a lasting mark on board relations. \"Having the two largest cities in California split from most of the rest of Metropolitan is not in the best interests of Metropolitan.\"L.A. and San Diego's concerns about the tunnel financing are not new. But they escalated with the move to make MWD the project's lead investor.Funds to pay MWD's tunnel debt will come from a yet-to-be-specified mix of charges, including water sales -- which make up the bulk of the agency's income -- fixed charges on water deliveries and the agency's long-standing property tax levy.In a report earlier this month, the Los Angeles Office of Public Accountability said the twin tunnels could tack an average of $30 a year onto L.A. household bills. But that surcharge could jump to $81 in what the office called a worst-case scenario: Dry years when the city purchases more MWD supplies to make up for low Owens Valley deliveries. And no buyers for the second tunnel capacity, leaving MWD customers stuck with the bill.Board member Brett Barbre, president of the Municipal Water District of Orange County, led the push for MWD to finance the majority of the full project.He said he balanced the risk of delay if the courts ordered a new environmental review for the one-tunnel version with the financial risk of building two tunnels.\"I think we'll have a much greater likelihood of selling that water and being made whole than succeeding on the phased approach,\" Barbre said.Politically conservative Orange County, he said, noting the irony, \"is doing something that is great for the Jerry Brown legacy.\"___(c)2018 the Los Angeles TimesVisit the Los Angeles Times at www.latimes.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "208"}
{"content": "July 25--Bay Area home buying slowed in June, as the busy summer home shopping season was chilled by scarce inventory and yet another month of near record-setting prices.Median prices last month for existing homes in the nine-county region rose double digits over the previous year to $920,000, just short of the record high set in May, according to a report released Wednesday by real estate data firm CoreLogic.Home sales dropped 9.2 percent from the previous year, suggesting many house-hunters are finally fed up or priced out of the Bay Area. The median re-sale price of single family homes in the region increased 12.1 percent from last June.\"It's obviously a combination of affordability and inventory constraints,\" CoreLogic analyst Andrew LePage said. \"We're seeing it statewide and nationally.\"Across the country, sales of existing U.S. homes dipped in June for the third straight month, according to a report released this week by the National Association of Realtors. Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the group, said a severe housing shortage is driving buyers out of the market.Bay Area home sales last month dipped to the lowest level for a June in four years. San Francisco was the only Bay Area county to see an uptick in sales -- and only by an additional 17 homes.The Bay Area housing shortage has driven up home values, creating personal wealth for homeowners, while leaving renters and newcomers grasping to get into the market.The streak of year-over-year sale price increases began in April 2012, when the median Bay Area home price was $425,000. But the days of half-million dollar homes have long passed, with seven-figure cash offers becoming the norm.About 80 percent of homes sold last month topped $500,000. More than 4 in 10 Bay Area homes sold for more than $1 million.The median sales price in June for single family homes in Alameda County was $947,750, according to CoreLogic. Prices rose to $1.32 million in Santa Clara County, $1.5 million in San Mateo County, $1.6 million in San Francisco, and $650,000 in Contra Costa County.The surge was led by Santa Clara County, where home prices rose 19.9 percent compared to last June. Alameda County prices rose by 13.1 percent in the same period, while San Mateo jumped 14.5 percent, Contra Costa rose 9.1 percent, and San Francisco increased 14.8 percent.Home sales historically increase from May to June, as families decide on purchases after the end of the school year. But Bay Area sales dropped 2.2 percent over the last two months.Sales also slowed in Southern California, with Los Angeles purchases falling 1.1 percent over the previous month. The greater Los Angeles region saw nearly a 12 percent drop in transactions from last year, according to CoreLogic data.LePage called the decrease in June home sales significant, adding that coming months may give a better picture of whether the super-charged market is slowing. \"It's hard to say what comes next in terms of volume,\" he said.In the Bay Area, high prices are knocking some families out of the market, local brokers said. Rising interest rates have also slowed purchases.Bill Moody, an agent with Referral Realty and president of the Silicon Valley Association of Realtors, said inventory has been growing this year, but still hasn't returned to normal levels.Santa Clara County properties near big tech companies remain popular, with strong sales in Sunnyvale, Mountain View and San Jose. \"You can't find a decent property for under a million bucks,\" Moody said.Mark Wong, an agent with Alain Pinel in Saratoga, said he sees fewer bids coming on properties, but prices have not dropped. \"The market is looking for a direction,\" Wong said.Wong said buyers have started to bid up townhomes, where first-time buyers can get better value.Henry Fan and his wife, Phoebe, looked at about 30 homes before winning a bid on a three-bedroom, two and a half bath townhome in San Jose for $1.11 million.The young family told Wong they wanted space for their two boys, aged two and six months, to grow up. The rent on their two-bedroom apartment in Mountain View was going up to about $4,400 a month, and the couple decided it would make financial sense to buy their first home.\"We were a little bit worried,\" said Fan, a 43-year-old engineer at Tesla. But the couple saw home prices continuing to rise, and they didn't want to keep renting.Their two-year old is excited about the community pool. \"We are not going to sell it for the next 10 years,\" Fan said. \"At least.\"___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "209"}

He just felt that he wasn't giving us a commitment, (in terms of his focus), when he was pitching and he was going to try to make the adjustment.\"Lopez starts against the Royals in Thursday's series finale. He's 2-5 with a 7.22 ERA in his last seven starts after compiling a 3.35 ERA in his first 14. He has thrown 122 innings, second to James Shields on the Sox staff.According to Brooks Baseball, Lopez's fastball averaged 97 mph in three consecutive starts in May but was down to an average of 94 against the Blue Jays. Lopez believes he's just making too many bad pitches.\"When you're not focused enough on the game you can't command, you can't control your pitches and you can't execute,\" Lopez said. \"That's the most important part for a pitcher, the focus. If you don't have focus, it's impossible for you to have control and have success.\"The 24-year-old is on pace to throw 186 innings in his first full major-league season. He has thrown 150-plus innings each of the last two seasons, including 168 2/3 last year between the majors and Triple-A Charlotte.Turning the page: Tim Anderson was back in the Sox lineup Wednesday after being pulled midgame in a 4-2 loss to the Royals. He failed to run to first base on a low liner that appeared to have been caught by third baseman Rosell Herrera but was ruled a trap by umpire Lance Barksdale.\"That was a unique situation that developed,\" Renteria said. \"Obviously we had our conversation last night and that was it. It was over.\"Extra innings: Yoan Moncada's leadoff home run off Jake Junis was his fifth career leadoff homer, the first since June 12. ... Shields is excited he will get to participate in a reunion of the Rays' 2008 AL pennant-winning team when the Sox play in St. Petersburg, Fla., this weekend.

{"content": "MINNEAPOLIS, MN \u2013 NOVEMBER 25: Alex Hornibrook (Photo by Hannah Foslien/Getty Images)No team is ever truly complete and Wisconsin Football is no exception. With a bit of a critical eye, here are five weaknesses for this year\u2019s Badgers team. This post is going to be admittedly very nitpicky. Wisconsin football is very talented this year, but no team in college football is ever perfect. Even last season\u2019s national champions had to make a quarterback change at halftime.Wisconsin is a team full of great strengths, and those will be highlighted in the future by Badger of Honor, but we need to get the weaknesses out of the way first. Wisconsin isn\u2019t a team associated with much weakness besides the general feeling that it recruits poorly. While that may be true, relative to its record and rankings anyway, the Badgers develop talent as well as any program in the country. The only downside that poor recruiting could mean is a lack of athletes.In 2018, the Badgers will not be without athletes. Thanks to recent recruits beginning to pan out, Wisconsin can now hit the occasional home run on offense and make huge, momentum-swinging plays on defense. Freshman Aron Cruickshank is going to have a lot of eyes on him due to his lightning speed and explosiveness. Receivers Quintez Cephus, Danny Davis, and A.J. Taylor are just as capable of making plays down the field for the Badgers. And Kendric Pryor added diversity to the offense with two touchdowns on rushing plays last season.Jonathan Taylor isn\u2019t your typical Wisconsin back either. He can bang in the trenches, but he has breakaway speed and can outrun defenders for long gains. The Badgers may have had issues in the past with picking up chunk yardage, but that won\u2019t be the case this year.Now that we\u2019ve debunked what is probably the most commonly thought of weakness for Wisconsin, let\u2019s get through what really might hinder the team this year.", "id": "211"}
{"content": "July 28--Antoine Kelly knew his worth. And even with a lifelong dream staring him down, the pitcher stood his ground.Kelly, who recently graduated from Maine East, was drafted in the 13th round by the San Diego Padres in June. With a dollar figure in mind and a backup plan at downstate Wabash Valley College, the 6-foot-5 left-handed pitcher did not budge on his price.He did not accept the Padres' offer and will head to Mount Carmel, Ill., on Aug. 9.Kelly declined to specify his asking price or what the Padres offered, but he said the numbers were \"fairly close.\" Because he will be attending a junior college, Kelly will be eligible to be drafted again next June. He said he's confident another year of training, growth and fine-tuning his mechanics will make him an even better prospect.The hard work has shown up off the field as well. Working with Ben Brewster of Tread Athletics, Kelly's weight has increased from 185 to 193 pounds in a month.\"A year ago, if I was old enough to be picked, I would've signed with (a team), no doubt,\" Kelly said. \"But going through this process, I'm learning the business of baseball. You have to know your worth.\"As a senior, Kelly struck out 98 batters in 42-1/3 innings with a fastball that touched 95 mph. He walked only 19 batters and recorded a 0.66 ERA.His parents, Valerie Feliciano and Antoine Kelly Sr., are also Maine East graduates. Feliciano said she's watched her son play baseball since he was 9, and she knew early on that he could be a special player.\"We knew right off the bat, from his first game, that he would be a great pitcher,\" Feliciano said. \"But that's as a kid. We thought he'd be a typical kid, going through a phase of just wanting to play a sport, then not wanting to do it the next year.\"His freshman year was when he'd start getting the attention. It was so foreign to all of us, especially me.\"Since that freshman year, Kelly has worked tirelessly to match his physical growth and his increased velocity with the pitch command required to excel. As a junior, Kelly walked 37 batters in 39-1/3 innings.\"What I've learned about is how determined he is,\" Feliciano said. \"Because he knows what he wants, he's so focused on it that he's willing to do whatever it takes. He wants to stay healthy, he wants to gain weight. He works out, he's always in bed at a decent time. He's matured and is thinking more like an adult rather than a kid with a hobby. He wants to make this a career.\"Kelly said he's proud of how he handled the negotiations with the Padres and how he reasoned his way to a fine decision. He also decided to head to Wabash after originally committing to Central Arizona.Kelly said he decided he didn't need to play in Arizona to make a name for himself. Instead, he'll only be a few hours from home and has already made a name for himself through the draft process.\"I'm much more knowledgeable about all of this,\" he said. \"The biggest thing I learned is, people say that you're a lefty and 6-5, so you get praise and things. But the minute you get into pro ball, you're just another person. You have to work and grind to get your spot.

{"content": "Aug. 03--Oklahoma football coach Lincoln Riley just made things a little uncomfortable for the Oakland A's.Riley indicated Friday that two-sport star Kyler Murray, the presumed starting quarterback for his fifth-ranked team, could play for the Sooners' football team the next two seasons. This would qualify as some unexpected news to the A's.Oakland, after all, signed Murray to a reported $4.6 million deal in June with the understanding he'd play just one more season for the Sooners before becoming a full-time baseball player.\"We'll see if it's his final year,\" Riley told reporters Friday at Oklahoma's third practice of the season. \"That hadn't been determined yet. I am not worried about if its is or if it isn't. That's going to have no impact on this year.\"Neither the A's nor Murray's camp revealed what the contract's language says about his commitment to baseball.Murray, who was considered the top athlete in the MLB draft, was still considered a bit of a reach by many observers when the A's took him with the ninth overall pick. While some compared Murray's baseball skills to those of a young Rickey Henderson, many teams feared Murray would ultimately choose football.Billy Beane and the A's had no such qualms, especially after learning Murray hired Scott Boras as his agent.\"The fact that Scott was involved gave us a sense of confidence before the draft,\" Beane said at the press conference to announce Murray's signing. \"Scott represents baseball players. Things moved very quickly, and it wasn't very complicated at all.\"Boras even praised the A's for allowing Murray to play one more year of football while taking over for Heisman Trophy winner Baker Mayfield.\"They understand the need for a player to check a box and do something he's committed to so he can come to our game with a very full and complete understanding of his goals in his life,\" Boras said.But Riley's surprising comments Friday indicate perhaps Murray won't be so eager to leave the football field.\"I've stayed out of the negotiation stuff with the A's,\" Riley told reporters. \"That's not my business, it's his business. My hope through this whole thing is that Kyler is gonna be able to do what he wants to do.

{"content": "Kansas City Chiefs head coach Andy Reid had a very interesting comment when talking about Patrick Mahomes on Thursday, but was it a dig at Alex Smith?The online world is ablaze with hot takes focused on Patrick Mahomes. The first-year starting quarterback in Kansas City has thrown a notable amount of interceptions in his first week of training camp, and the vultures are out.On Thursday, head coach Andy Reid stepped to the podium and was asked how he felt about the turnovers. His response was one of the more authentic we\u2019ve seen from the veteran coach in quite some time.\u201cIf you don\u2019t have the intestinal fortitude to go test it, you\u2019re gonna be one of these quarterbacks that checks it down every time\u2026 and that\u2019s not what it\u2019s all about.\u201dDamn, Andy! So the obvious question is whether this was a shot at former quarterback Alex Smith, who the Chiefs traded to the Washington Redskins this offseason for a third-round pick and star corner Kendall Fuller.The answer is an unequivocal no. While the words could be twisted for some to make it seem that way, anybody who is even slightly familiar with Reid and his fondness for Smith knows this wasn\u2019t the intention. Additionally, Smith became more of a risk-taker under Reid, throwing for more than 4,000 yards for the first time in his career last season.Reid is simply trying to get the masses to calm down when it comes to Mahomes and his early penchant for picks. Ultimately, this is training camp. Mahomes should be throwing the ball into tight spots, finding out what he can and can\u2019t get away with. Otherwise, he\u2019s wasting valuable reps before going into his preseason affair of the year, Aug. 9 against the Houston Texans.Everybody can calm down, it\u2019s practice.

{"content": "July 30--* The following commentary appeared recently in the Hotline newsletter ...Many months ago ... before the Supreme Court legalized gambling and the Pac-12 released its financial data ... before the conference banned 5-7 teams from the postseason and declared Olympic sports success matters as much as football success ... a curious thing happened in the SEC:Commissioner Greg Sankey squashed attempts by Alabama (and others) to hire former Mississippi coach Hugh Freeze for a staff position.It was a surprising, if unprecedented move in that commissioners typically don't wade into the campus hiring process. But an SEC bylaw gave Sankey the authority to influence hiring decisions in extreme circumstances:When a potential employee has been involved in major NCAA violations, as was the case with Freeze during his tenure at Ole Miss.The development prompted me to consider the role of commissioner authority in Pac-12 hiring practices, particularly in the wake of the basketball corruption case that engulfed two schools, USC and Arizona.Should the conference be involved in hiring coaches, to some degree?Put another way:Can the athletic directors be trusted to hire clean head coaches and, just as critically, can the head coaches be trusted to hire clean assistants?The standard to activate commissioner authority within the Pac-12 would have to be high, just as high as it is in the SEC. It would have to involve candidates with serious, proven transgressions.Intrigued by the topic, I reached out to every athletic director in the Pac-12. Most declined to comment for the record, and no one thought the conference office should have a formal role. (Commissioner Larry Scott agrees with that view, by the way.)\"I think it's worthy of robust conversation,\" Arizona's Dave Heeke said.\"Hiring an employee at the university level must be under the purview of the university, but I hope the conference office could be used as a source of information and consultation. It can play a role.\"I took that idea to Chris Hill, who, at the time, was in his final days as Utah's athletic director.\"More pressure has to be put on the president and the athletic director,\" Hill explained.\"We know who the coaches are that have the potential to cause you trouble. We can't look at each other and say, wink-wink, 'He's found the lord; he won't cause us any problems.' We need to make sure the coaches are fully vetted.\"That's when the idea coalesced:Could the Pac-12 office play a formalized role in the vetting process in football and men's basketball?Head and assistants coaches with sketchy reputations are hired all the time across in the country because the dirt, so to speak, doesn't always reach the eyes and ears of the search firms and the campus committees who advise athletic directors.After all, it took an FBI sting, complete with undercover agents and wiretaps, to expose a handful of assistant coaches. How in the world would the suits running an executive placement firm know who's really dirty?And when it comes to hiring assistant coaches -- the staffers perhaps most susceptible to moral and ethical transgressions -- there are no committees or search firms; there aren't even athletic directors. The head coach alone makes the call.Yep, the same head coach who's job security is tied to winning, and who knows that winning is tied to recruiting ... and who knows that recruiting often requires a trip to the underworld.The timing involved in formalized vetting at the conference level would be tricky, because hires often unfold at a moment's notice and end in a flash: Candidate A says no, so let's go with Candidate B. There wouldn't always be time for a full background check, for lengthy conversations.But something would be better than nothing, especially on the men's basketball side.Why shouldn't the conference retain a hiring specialist -- perhaps a former coach who has seen the filth unfold before his eyes -- in order to advise the campuses on who's known to be clean and who's thought to be dirty?That specialist would consult with the athletic director hiring a head coach, or with the head coach hiring an assistant, and notify him/her if there are red flags from the sport's underbelly.The conference should be as proactive as possible, because unless players get compensated for their services and skills, the corruption isn't going away.------Why we need your support: Like so many other providers of local journalism across the country, the Hotline's parent website, mercurynews.com, recently moved to a subscription model.

He's got a lot of pain in there.\"Morrow was more firm when talking to reporters hours after Hickey's comments.\"I'm not coming off the DL on Saturday, Morrow said. \"I'm hoping to pick up a baseball by then. I haven't been throwing.\"There's a little bit of soreness. But it's going in the right direction. Each day has been better.\"Morrow was placed on the disabled list on July 19 with right biceps inflammation. He was also on the DL in June with a lower back problem.\"It's a fraction of what it was,\" said Morrow, who continues to spend time in the trainer's room trying to reduce the inflammation.\"It's always frustrating on the DL. It's boring and you don't get to play. It sucks.\"Newly acquired Jesse Chavez could inherit some of the closer duties in Morrow's absence because of his versatility and instant success since joining the Cubs on Saturday in a trade with the Rangers.Pitcher Yu Darvish will throw a bullpen session on Friday in St. Louis, manager Joe Maddon said. Hickey said he will throw two more bullpen sessions before facing live hitters.\"We really need him,\" Hickey told WSCR. \"We need that power arm, especially as we move toward the playoffs.\"Darvish has made just eight starts this season, the last one on May 20, when he went six innings in a 6-1 victory over the Reds.

{"content": "Aug. 02--PHOENIX -- With a 5.0 game deficit in the division and the wildcard race, the Giants have their work cut out for them, particularly during the first half of August.Over the next two weeks, the Giants will face three first-place teams and the surging Pittsburgh Pirates, a club that's been among the hottest in baseball over the last month.On Thursday, they'll begin one of their most challenging stretches of the year in Phoenix against the D'backs with a mission of gaining ground against the co-NL West leaders.Pitching matchupsThursday: Madison Bumgarner (3-4, 3.06) vs. Zack Greinke (12-5, 2.96), 6:40 p.m. NBCSBAFriday: Chris Stratton (8-6, 5.14) vs. Patrick Corbin (7-4, 3.26), 6:40 p.m. NBCSBASaturday: Andrew Su\u00e1rez (4-6, 4.11) vs. Clay Buchholz (4-1, 2.65), 5:10 p.m. NBCSBASunday: Derek Holland (5-8, 3.90) vs. Robbie Ray (3-2, 5.05), 1:10 p.m. NBCSBAThree things to watch1. Battle of acesThe last time the Giants traveled to Chase Field, they left the desert heat with a three-game sweep of Arizona. San Francisco's offense played a big role in the club's victories, but the Giants didn't have to contend with D'backs ace Zack Greinke.This week, they'll open their four-game set with a battle against the reigning National League Pitcher of the Month and counter with Madison Bumgarner. No pitcher has enjoyed a better run since the middle of June, as Greinke has a 1.16 ERA and a 6-0 record in his last seven starts.Bumgarner rebounded from walking six batters against the A's by throwing eight innings of two-run ball against the Brewers in his last outing, but the Giants have lost three of his last five starts. If the Giants want to secure their first winning road trip of the season, winning the battle of aces would make that a much easier task.2. Is Stratton the answer in the Giants rotation?With Cueto and Jeff Samardzija on the disabled list, Chris Stratton will reenter the team's rotation and start Friday against Arizona.Stratton is the Giants' leader in wins with eight, but he was optioned to Triple-A in July after his ERA spiked and the club needed to clear a rotation spot. Though he's allowed at least three earned runs in each of his last three appearances, including one game out of the bullpen, the Giants are thin on starting pitching depth and hopeful Stratton rises to the challenge.The right-hander found himself at the major league level with two excellent months at the end of last season, and if the Giants are going to remain in contention, they'll need Stratton to pitch like he did in 2017.3. Can the offense turn the pageAfter a miserable month in July in which the Giants posted the seventh-worst batting average in baseball, they'll open August in a hitter-friendly park against pitchers they've seen quite often this season.One of the biggest obstacles for San Francisco this weekend will be hitting against a retooled D'backs bullpen which added righty Brad Ziegler and southpaw Jake Diekman at the trade deadline. With new additions at the back end, Arizona may have the most complete bullpen in the NL West.The Giants will need a better August from their core players, including Brandon Crawford and Buster Posey who both posted their lowest OPS in any month of the season in July.___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "221"}
{"content": "Getting into shape can be a struggle, to say the least. There is a lot of hard work and dedication that goes into weight loss. When you consider how busy we are in our day-to-day lives, it\u2019s hard to imagine how one might be able to dedicate the amount of time it takes to go to the gym daily. It may seem like you must be working hard in the gym every day to achieve an ideal physique, but in all actuality, it\u2019s the choices you make outside of the gym that really matter. You will find that working out on a full stomach of greasy, hard to digest foods, feels like treading through sinking sand. This is why more and more people are turning to juices for weight loss.Here\u2019s a 1 week plan of juicing recipes for weight loss:Day 1: Do Your Research     Juicing is a relatively modern concept, which is why we are seeing such an influx of juicing recipes for weight loss. In addition to the methods, we are also experiencing an industry serge. The food market has taken notice of their consumers interest in using juices for weight loss. As a result, we are seeing more beverage driven companies offering a higher volume of juice-based drinks. The only problem with this is the fact that these companies are not able to supply us with these \u201chealthy\u201d beverage alternatives without adding preservatives and unnecessary sugar.Day 2: Buy a Juicer     Buying a juicer is highly recommended if you are looking to start using juicing recipes for weight loss. By creating your own juices, it gives you complete control over what is going into your body. This will make it so much easier to monitor what is and is not working for you.Day 3: Green Makes You LeanThe best part about using juicing recipes for weight loss is the fact that you can get most of your daily nutrients all packed into one glass. Usually, you are also able to mask a lot of bitter tastes that you may not be so partial to by adding in sweeter fruits.If, for instance, you despise the flavor of kale, you can suppress that taste by adding more bananas or mango to your juice. Bananas are one of the most sugar intense fruits that are easily accessible at your standard grocery store.Mixing sweeter fruits with leafy greens will give you the added benefits of vitamin K and a high quantity of antioxidants without having to stomach the bitter taste of the dark green leaf.     Day 4: Fresh Vs. FrozenBy the fourth day, you may start to find the DIY juicing a bit taxing on your time. Although some may argue that fresh whole fruits and vegetables are the only logical choice for your juicing recipes for weight loss, it\u2019s not always the case. Frozen fruits and veggies give you the convenience of quick access to a refreshing juice.They cut prep time practically in half because most frozen fruits are already peeled and cut into manageable pieces, perfectly sized for blending or juicing. Adding in some frozen element will also result in a more slushy-like consistency.Day 5: Get It While It\u2019s\u2026ColdMeal prep is a great way to get you seamlessly through the week without having to do much of the guesswork before eating. However, when it comes to fresh juice you should not prepare more juice than you are ready to consume immediately. As mentioned before, the juice you produce at home does not contain preservatives. Meaning that a juice left standing, even if it is refrigerated, becomes susceptible to harmful bacteria.Even if it is kept in an airtight container, if the juice has not been consumed within a 24-hour period, the leftover juice should be thrown out to prevent the possible spread of food born illness. Getting sick on questionable juice can easily be avoided by only preparing one to two servings of juice at a time.Day 6: Fruits Too High in SugarThe monotony of the same flavors may be getting to you by the sixth day and you may want to add a bit sweeter fruits to your juices. Though they may make your juicing recipes for weight loss taste as sweet as a milkshake, the fruits with the highest grams of sugar should be used sparingly. The correct balanced guidelines to follow would be 2/3 vegetables to 1/3 use of fruit. Fruits such as figs, grapes, pomegranates, and cherries contain the highest amount of sugar and calories. Figs and grapes tying for the most sugar-filled at 13.8 grams. They are obviously the more health conscious alternative to a spoonful of sugar but should still not dominate your juice.Day 7: Just Add WaterWith every glass of fresh juice you consume, try adding a companion glass of water. It will aid your freshly squeezed or pressed juice in flushing out toxins and keep you hydrated as well.Many have found using juices for weight loss a great tool to have in their arsenal. When they\u2019re not in the gym, they tend to reach for a fresh pressed or squeezed juice instead of a filling meal. The heartier green juices work fantastically as meal replacements. Before and after the gym they are doing the same and thriving because they are no longer weighed down by a full, heavy meal.The key to weight loss is the balance. You will not experience your desired results without taking both your diet and your workout regimen into full account. Doing one without the other will leave you spinning your wheels.", "id": "222"}
{"content": "Aug. 02--In the annals of vicious black comedies whose theme is failing upward, \"The Captain\" is surely among the most chilling and improbably fact-based. Writer-director Robert Schwentke's German-language picture, acquired for U.S. distribution by Chicago-based Music Box Films, is based on the bizarre true story of Willi Herold, a German paratrooper (the movie leaves that part out). Separated from his unit in the chaotic final weeks of World War II, Herold came upon the abandoned car of a Luftwaffe captain.In a back-seat suitcase, Herold found his temporary salvation: the papers and uniform belonging to another man. Identify assumed, Herold (barely 20) embarked on a fiendishly effective long-form improvisation, impersonating the officer in one tense situation after another.At a prison camp for German army deserters, Herold ordered the execution of more than 100 soldiers. He claimed he was specially designated by Hitler to report on conditions behind the lines, and then do as he pleased. These bloody exploits continued for a while. Desperate, inhumane times, the movie says in every single scene, breed the worst survival instincts known to humankind.Gallows humor settles like dust over the picture, which begins with a man alone, and gradually acquires more ancillary characters, in an ever wider sphere of slaughter. Early on, another private (Milan Peschel), also a deserter, requests that he be attached to Capt. Herold's unit. The request is granted, and the ruse begins in earnest.Two sets of eyes dominate the film: Peschel's wide, soulful stare, embodying the appalled conscience of the piece, and the icy, opaque gaze of Max Hubacher, the striking young actor who portrays Herold. He's riveting, even though the conception of Herold as written keeps the man at a remove. He's an actor playing an actor, working without a script or a net or scruples.Working with cinematographer Florian Ballhous, and shooting mostly in pristine black-and-white, Schwentke treats much of \"The Captain\" as the blackest of comedies, as fortune and outlandish coincidence give Herold a helping hand time and time again. There's a limitation, however, and it's significant. The movie risks only so much. Many of the flourishes come off as callow, superficial. You watch \"The Captain\" with a sick feeling in your stomach, but probably not sick enough.\"The situation is always what you make of it,\" says the most bloodthirsty of the deserters who fall into Herold's makeshift unit. As Herold transforms himself into the horror he's playacting, we're meant to cringe at the seductive qualities of fascism, as gathered up, on the fly, by this one man. Deliberately, Schwentke allows himself various ahistorical and stylistically anachronistic elements, from the techno-throb of the musical cues (by composer Martin Todsharow) to the sardonic, slangy tone of some of the dialogue. In his own mind, Herold becomes \"the avenging angel of our sacred German honor,\" as he says late in the game. Or is he just pretending? The movie's an artfully sustained guessing game, tense and rarely dull. It's also afflicted with a jokey, jaunty tone as deliberate as it is limiting.Michael Phillips is a Tribune critic.mjphillips@chicagotribune.com\"The Captain\" -- 2.5 starsNo MPAA rating (violence, nudity, some language)Running time: 1:58.Opens: Friday at the Music Box, 3733 N.

{"content": "Aug. 03--The sun is shining. Yet look around and you'll see lots of worry about the economy. A selection of headlines: \"A storm is brewing.\" \"Is a recession on the horizon?\" \"What will cause the next recession?\" \"12 charts to watch for signs of the next U.S. downturn.\" Yikes, time to stock up on canned goods.On second thought, no.While pessimism comes naturally to economists, and journalists, we're inspired to revel in the positives and root to keep this momentum going. The economy is growing at a solid 4.1 percent. Paychecks are up 2.7 percent over the past year, and should continue to rise after a long period of mediocre wage growth. Best of all, people are finding work. The unemployment rate is 3.9 percent. It's at a record low for Hispanics and near a record for African-Americans.Jobs mean everything to the nation's sense of well-being. Opportunity offers fulfillment; paychecks create prosperity. Do you feel better about your prospects? You should. The economy is booming.Here's a mind-bending fact: There are more job openings than job seekers across the U.S. There are about 6.6 million available jobs and not quite that number of people looking. The phenomenon, seen for the first time since such record-keeping began in 2000, speaks to surging private-sector growth. Want a job? You probably can find one, and maybe convince your prospective boss to relax the company ban on tattoos and piercings.But you'll need the skills that job demands. News reports from the Quad Cities quote construction and manufacturing employers complaining they can't find enough carpenters, plumbers, project managers and others. \"We're so busy, we have guys on mandatory overtime,\" said the head of a metal fabrication firm. \"They're great guys, I just want more of them.\" The jobless rate in Davenport-Moline-Rock Island-Bettendorf is 4 percent; it was at 10 percent, along with the rest of the country, in the wake of the Great Recession.Assuming the good times continue until next July, this will become the longest period of expansion in U.S. history, surpassing the 1990s, which included the tech boom. So compared to previous eras, the nation should be very late in its positive economic cycle. Hence, the fretful headlines.But why can't the growth continue, and accelerate? During much of the 2009-to-present expansion, with President Barack Obama in office, growth trundled along at about 2 percent. President Donald Trump took office saying he wanted to goose the sustained growth rate to 3 percent. He and the Republican-led Congress cut taxes to put money in the pockets of consumers and give businesses an incentive to invest and hire. Both are happening. The Trump administration also is focused on reducing regulatory red tape as an additional inducement to companies to bet on their future.Businesses are reacting to those policy changes: Their confidence leads to more investment, which adds jobs and spurs gross domestic product growth. On and on may it go. Trump is betting he can squeeze out an even better performance through more advantageous trade deals. But that's risky. Trade disputes with China and other countries could impede growth. We'd rather see Trump negotiate new deals than fight. More exports mean more jobs; more imports mean more choices for consumers.America is better off when more people are working. Right now, that's happening.Join the discussion on Twitter @Trib_Ed_Board and on Facebook.Submit a letter to the editor here or email letters@chicagotribune.com.___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "224"}

{"content": "Aug. 01--When Sophia de Oliveira left her post as general manager at Devereaux last November, she wasn't sure if or when she was going to return to the restaurant world. She'd worked in hospitality her whole life and despite the deep connections she'd made, she felt like she needed to step away.\"It was just not my scene,\" de Oliveira said. \"The Gold Coast sort of luxury, I was just very much like, 'wow, this is such a wrong fit.'It wasn't until she met Jeff Zappone that she felt like there was finally a project she could see herself committing to. On Thursday, she's opening a punk rock-themed bar named Good Measure in River North that's not only focused on providing an inviting space, but is also committed to creating a positive environment for its employees.\"My employees are my bottom line,\" de Oliveira said. \"If they're happy and well taken care of, they're going to take care of our guests and we're all going to pay our bills.\" To that end, de Oliveira and her team are intentionally hiring fifty-percent persons of color and fifty-percent women, along with paying staff above industry standards for hourly wages. Health insurance offerings will also be made after contiguous employment, plus paid vacation for full-time staff, paid training workshops, and an intentional approach to work-life balance in the form of 40 hour weeks with three full days off, unheard of for many hospitality employees. \"You can treat people with respect and integrity, and have a diverse workplace and build something really special that makes people feel safe and proud.\"In addition to Devereaux, De Oliveira has done stints at Swift &amp; Sons, Cold Storage, Osteria Langhe and Benny's Chop House, and was encouraged by friends to meet Zappone, now her partner and director of operations. He approached her with the idea of a burger and beer bar, and she was less than impressed.\"I told him straight up, 'I think it's great you can do this but quite frankly, the last thing I think this industry needs is another place to get a burger and beer.'\"The name pays homage to the space's former use as a tailor shop, but it also nods to the simplicity of the drinks, precision of the food and the musical component. Good Measure is not merely a burger and beer bar, although it will have both, de Oliveira said, who loves simple, straightforward cocktails. Expect classics like a cosmopolitan with a modern twist, made with aronia berry liqueur, Mandarine Napoleon, fresh lime juice and a housemade citrus-infused vodka.De Oliveira is particularly excited about the Toki whisky highball machine, which she called \"an incredible piece of craftsmanship.\"\"I love using good products and using new, fun things to work with, but a lot of us (bartenders) are just sick of the pretension,\" de Oliveira said. \"For me, (hospitality) is so much more about the people than anything on a menu.\"Matt Troost, partner and chef (formerly of Charlatan and Three Aces), will be helming the kitchen. Mussels will be prepared \"lowbrow,\" with PBR, shallots, thyme and Spam, or \"highbrow,\" with saffron-guajillo broth, hominy, jalapeno, cabbage and cilantro. Pork ribs will be served withblack bean chakalaka, a South African curry dish made with cabbage, jalapeno and tomatoes. And of course, Troost has created a simple bar burger, named the &amp;14GM (\"And one for good measure\") Burger, made with an onion bun, smoked American cheese, aioli, lettuce, tomato and onion.Less conventional items include Nashville hot duck livers, sweet corn and salt cod brandade, and a devil honey fried chicken.De Oliveira says the bar's punk theme is less about punk's anarchic roots, but rather the idea of the restaurant and bar being open to anyone, regardless of who they are and where they came from. The moody red-and-black interior, designed by Siren Betty Design studio, will feature a lot of leather and studs, but is more polished than gritty.\"We're all like lost puppies in the world, and we've finally found this little home and it's really, really awesome and totally worth everything that we've all gone through to get here to this point.\"Good Measure, 226 W.

{"content": "The Dallas Cowboys are currently underway with training camp and there are a few players who have stood out. Let\u2019s take a look at some camp standouts.The Dallas Cowboys are knee deep in training camp and are beginning to work out which players belong on the 53 man roster. While this camp has been more interesting than those in the past for several reasons, the most important factor would be how much opportunity is available to younger players. This camp has been about letting the youth on this team shine especially in the secondary and defensive line. With such potent competition, this year let\u2019s take a look at three players who have turned heads during training camp.Byron Jones:For some time, Dallas Cowboy fans have wanted to see Byron Jones finally grow into an elite piece of the secondary, it appears that time is now. We have seen players have good camps and falter during the regular season but Jones has something this year. Jones has more of an edge and less hesitation in man to man situations as he has shown significant growth during this years camp. Could that be because of Kris Richard\u2019s new approach with Jones? That definitely has something to do with it as Richard has seemed to have a plan for Jones in this defensive scheme all along and is finally being able to utilize it. Jones is expected to be the Dallas Cowboys top cornerback this season so it makes sense that his development has been paramount to the defensive coaching staff. This is a contract year for Jones so expect some fireworks from the former first-round pick. Tavon Austin/Michael Gallup/Allen Hurns:This group of wide receivers has been interesting to watch, to say the least. Everyone expects them to do very little this season but in reality, they are a group of productive players looking for their place in the NFL. The release of Dez Bryant has overshadowed just how surprisingly good this wide receiving corps has been. Deonte Thompson, Tavon Austin, Michael Gallup, and Allen Hurns have all impressed at times. Gallup had an incredible day where he looked like a number one wide receiver. Hurns shows his veteran instincts mixed with some powerful physicality. He has dominated a couple of defensive backs this offseason and should be worth the money the Dallas Cowboys paid for him. Austin has been incredibly fast and efficient when targeted. He looks like the fastest player on the field and has been running some interesting intermediate/deep routes and finding a modest amount of success. Gallup\u2019s skills far surpass those of a rookie and he could make more of an impact than originally thought. This could be the season that one of these players breaks through to superstardom. Jihad Ward: The Dallas Cowboys would be in a real bind if not for trading Ryan Switzer for Jihad Ward during the 2018 NFL Draft. David Irving\u2019s suspension put this team behind the eight ball and a replacement was hard to come by until the front office acquired Ward. Since then he has been a wrecking machine on defense, proving to be one of the best defensive tackles on the roster. Ward is actually looking like one of the best defensive linemen on the roster so the team could have gotten a secret weapon to add to their arsenal. If Ward is as productive as he shows during practice then it will be hard for David Irving to win back his starting job. So far this camp has been pretty eye-opening in terms of just how far this team could grow in terms of talent.Only time will tell if this optimism and growth will translate into on the field success", "id": "228"}

{"content": "July 27--SAN FRANCISCO -- The baseball Gods didn't toss him any breaks.A funky hop on a seemingly-routine ground ball to first opened the door to a two-run eighth inning that played a key role in the Milwaukee Brewers 7-5 win over the Giants at AT&amp;T Park. The loss dropped the Giants back to .500 as they're trying to chase down the Los Angeles Dodgers, Arizona Diamondbacks and Colorado Rockies in the National League West with 58 games left on the schedule.Christian Yelich got credited with a hit on the eighth inning grounder, exonerating Slater from any blame.\"The ball took a bad hop,\" Giants manager Bruce Bochy explained.Slater, who's played \"10 to 15 games\" at first with Triple-A Sacramento this year, got penciled in at the position because the Giants sent Belt to the 10-day disabled list to recover from a bone bruise in his right knee suffered in Seattle Wednesday.Belt said there wasn't any structural damage to his knee, which got hyperextended as he was legging out an infield single.\"As far as that goes, that was a win,\" Belt said.It wasn't necessarily a win for Slater, who second guessed whether he made the right play after the game.\"I think if I charged it I might have still have had an in-between hop,\" Slater said. \"You can always second guess yourself. Obviously, what I did wasn't the right play.\"After the strange hop, Travis Shaw, Ryan Braun and Erik Kratz strung together consecutive singles off reliever Mark Melancon, bringing in a pair of runs that broke a 2-2 tie.Melancon (0-1) followed up his blown save in Oakland Sunday by picking up the loss, surrendering two earned runs on four hits and a walk in 2/3 inning of work.Chris Stratton didn't fair any better in his first appearance since he got recalled from Triple-A Sacramento earlier in the day. Stratton allowed the Brewers to break the game wide open in the ninth by giving up three earned runs on three hits, including a home run to Shaw.The Giants mounted a comeback effort in the eighth, scoring a run before Hunter Pence struck out with runners at the corners to end the rally. They added two more runs in the ninth.Pence also grounded into a double play in the second with no outs and the bases loaded, driving in a run but hindering the Giants chances of putting a crooked number on the scoreboard.Bochy said the idea of using the last batter on his bench to pinch hit for Pence in the eighth never crossed his mind. At that point, Pablo Sandoval was the only option available because the Giants added another pitcher to their roster Thursday by recalling Stratton and sending Kelby Tomlinson down to Triple-A Sacramento.\"Hunter's had some pretty big hits,\" Bochy said. \"He's been finding a way to come through when we need him.\"The loss spoiled another quality start from rookie right-hander Dereck Rodriguez and a respectable showing from Evan Longoria, who was reinstated from the disabled list Thursday. Rodriguez surrendered two earned runs off five hits in six innings of work, making him 3-0 with a 2.25 ERA over his last seven starts.His only eye-popping mistake came in the sixth when Yelich led off the inning with a home run on the first pitch to tie the game up at 2-2.\"I was not expecting him to swing,\" Rodriguez said. \"He got a good pitch to hit and put a good swing on it.\"Longoria, who missed 34 games with a fractured hand, singled in his first two at bats since June 14, scoring off a Steven Duggar single in the second.The Brewers opened the scoring in the first when Eric Thames led off with a double and scored on back-to-back ground ball outs to the right side of the infield.Brewers pitcher Josh Hader made his first road appearance since racist and homophobic tweets that he sent out as a high schooler surfaced during the All-Star game. The left-hander received a round of scattered boos as he replaced starter Wade Miley with two outs in the sixth, a contrast from the standing ovation he received at Miller Park Saturday. But the response was relatively mild considering that San Francisco is the home of the gay rights movement and a bastion of liberal thought.Security took extra precaution with Hader, protecting him with a police officer and a security guard as he warmed up in the bullpen along the right field line.Prior to the game, Hader insisted he'd be ready for whatever Giants fans throw at him, saying he wouldn't allow his past or the crowd to become a distraction. He backed up his words, inducing a ground out to end a Giants rally in the sixth before tossing a hitless seventh with two strikeouts.\"I'm not really expecting anything,\" Hader said Thursday afternoon. \"Whatever they want to say to me, if it's good or bad, I'm ready for anything.\"I really don't know how they will react. I'm here to do my job and not let any distractions get to me, whether it's my past mistakes or the crowd.\"___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "230"}
{"content": "UTEP football went winless in 2017 for the first time in 44 years. Can new head coach Dana Dimel turn things around and get the Miners back to winning ways in 2018?It would be disingenuous to say that UTEP has ever been anything approximating a powerhouse in its long history of playing football. In more than eight decades of playing in one conference or another, UTEP boasts just two league championships. The first came in 1956, when the school was still known as Texas Western. That year, the Miners went 9-2 and beat Arizona State to claim the title in the six-team Border Conference.Nearly half a century later, the Miners won a share of the 2000 WAC championship alongside TCU at 7-1 in league play. (UTEP, though, lost the head-to-head contest against the Horned Frogs.) In between, the occasional bowl appearance was the best most fans could expect from the plucky but overmatched outfit in El Paso.So it wasn\u2019t entirely Sean Kugler\u2019s fault that things went sour last year in El Paso. Yet Kugler felt compelled to depart UTEP midway through the season after a 0-5 start to the season. In came Mike Price, who spent nine years as head coach of the Miners between 2004 and 2012, to take over as interim coach. Price couldn\u2019t muster a single win in his return to leadership, and his 10th season at the helm in El Paso prove to be his worst of the lot.Now it falls to Dana Dimel to see if he can resurrect UTEP. It is unlikely that the Miners are about to become the next Group of Five powerhouse, even given the advantages of being a Texas school in a talent-rich state. But they can get back to the respectability of middle-class status in Conference USA and fighting for semi-regular bowl eligibility.Can Dimel find six or seven wins in his first year at the helm and get the Miners back to the postseason? Let\u2019s look at the offense and defense before assessing the schedule and the prospects for UTEP in 2018.", "id": "231"}

She was taken in critical condition to Mount Sinai Medical Center.A friend said she and the woman were sex workers and were working together when Charlie L. Booker approached. He and the victim left for a secluded alley near Harrison Street and Kilbourn Avenue. The friend said she was worried, so she asked a man she knew to keep an eye on them.The man rushed in when he heard the woman scream and fought the man off with a screwdriver, the friend said. The attacker was described as having a tattoo of the Chicago skyline on his chest and neck.On July 18, a woman in Memphis was sexually assaulted and shot three times by a man who stole her car, according to authorities. On Wednesday, Illinois state police stopped Booker near Kankakee while he was speeding in the woman's car on Interstate 57, police said.He has been charged with possession of a stolen vehicle, obstructing identification and driving on a suspended license in that case.In the Chicago stabbing, Booker has been charged with attempted murder and is being held without bail in Cook County Jail.

{"content": "July 27--The Cubs Thursday night agreed to a deal for four-time All-Star left-hander Cole Hamels of the Rangers.Hamels, a 12-year veteran and four-time All Star, is 5-9 with a 4.72 ERA in 20 starts this year. He has hit 12 batters this season, most in the majors.The 34-year-old was drafted in the first round (17th overall) by the Phillies in 2002 and played in Philadelphia from 2006-2015, when he was traded to the Rangers. Hamels was the 2008 World Series MVP, helping the Phillies beat Joe Maddon's Rays.Here are some things to know about the newest Cub.1. Hamels go-to pitch is the changeup. \"His big weapon is a change-up, his strikeout pitch against both righthanders and lefthanders,\" Hardball Times wrote. \"Against left-handed hitters Hamels used the change-up about 24 percent of the time throughout most of the year.\" According to Brooks Baseball, in 2018, he has relied primarily on his fourseam fastball (clocked at 92 mph) and cutter (88 mph). ... His change generates an extremely high number of swings and misses ... and results in somewhat more flyballs compared to other pitchers' changeups. His sinker is a real worm killer that generates an extreme number of groundballs.\"2. Hamels' no-hitter at Wrigley Field on July 25, 2015, was the first against the Cubs in 50 years or 7,920 games. Jake Arrieta, going for his 12th win, took the loss. The previous was when Sandy Koufax threw a perfect game against them on Sept. 9, 1965, at Dodger Stadium. At the time of Hamel's no-hitter, the Philies were rumored to be considering trading Hamels to the Cubs.3. Hamels scored a 1510 on his SAT. \"Yeah. I don't really tell many people that,\" Hamels told mlb.com. \"I guess not all athletes fit the jock prototype.\"4. His wife, Heidi, was a contestant on \"Survivor\" in 2002, the show's sixth season. She finished fifth. \"(They) said they picked me because I was strong and tough,\" she told Philly Mag. She had been working as a physical education teacher in Missouri after graduating from Drury University. She met Cole at a minor league game and he asked her for her autograph. \"She didn't know who I was, which worked out perfectly, because I knew she was genuine,\" he told mlb.com.5. Last December, the Hamels donated their $9.4 million mansion and 100 acres of land in southwest Missouri to Camp Barnabas, a charity that provides camps for children with special needs and chronic illnesses and their siblings. The 32,000-square foot home is near Table Rock Lake near Reeds Springs. Heidi Hamels grew up in Buffalo, Missouri. \"Seeing the faces, hearing the laughter, reading the stories of the kids they serve; there is truly nothing like it,\" Cole Hamels said at the time. \"Barnabas makes dreams come true, and we felt called to help them in a big way.\"Sources: Tribune archives, Baseballreference.com, MLB.com, BrooksBaseball___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "235"}
{"content": "Aug. 02--After more than 70 years of business, Wheeling-based Skokie Valley Beverage Co. is closing its doors and selling off chunks of its North Side and north suburban distribution business to longtime competitors.Lakeshore Beverage Co., the Chicago area's largest distributor of Budweiser -- among scores of other brands -- is buying the rights to distribute Old Style beer north of Armitage Avenue into Wrigleyville, which remains a stronghold for the aging brand. Lakeshore will also acquire the rights to more than 700,000 cases annually of LaCroix sparkling water, bringing its total to about 1.5 million cases. That will make Lakeshore the largest distributor of LaCroix in the U.S., according to Beer Marketer's Insights, a trade publication.Meanwhile, two other wholesalers, Chicago Beverage Systems and Windy City Distributing, both of which are owned by Reyes Holdings, are carving up the rest of Skokie Valley's business. Chicago Beverage Systems will acquire rights to distribute about 1 million cases annually of popular Mexican imports like Modelo and Corona, in northern Cook County. And Windy City will acquire distribution rights to Lake Barrington-based Wild Onion Brewery.The sale is expected to close Friday; terms were not disclosed. William Schirmang, CEO of the fourth-generation family-owned Skokie Valley Beverage, declined to be interviewed Thursday. Nearly all of company's 60 to 70 employees will be hired by the other three wholesalers, said Joe Thompson, president of the Independent Beverage Group, who served as a consultant on the deal.\"This allows us to expand our portfolio into a wider swath of this city,\" said J.R. Hand, president and CEO of Hand Family Cos., parent company of Lakeshore Beverage, on Thursday.Lakeshore already distributes Old Style and LaCroix in other parts of the city; this deal allows it to distribute those brands north of Armitage to the Cook County line, Hand said.As beer sales have been flat or declining in recent years, Lakeshore has increased its nonalcoholic beverage offerings, Hand said. And LaCroix is king of the sparkling waters.\"It's probably one of the hottest brands there is,\" Hand said. \"It's very beneficial to us, strategically.\"And Lakeshore already distributes Budweiser, the official beer of the Chicago Cubs, in Wrigleyville. Now it can also sell the former official beer of the Cubs, Old Style, to area retailers. Lakeshore is also acquiring North American Breweries, parent company of Labatt and Seagram's brands, from Skokie Valley Beverage.There's been more recent consolidation among wholesalers of wine and spirits, as compared to beer. Last year, for example, Breakthru Beverage Group, the alcohol wholesale company that has its Illinois operation based in Cicero, announced plans to merge with Texas-based Republic National Distributing Co. to form the second-largest alcohol distributor in the United States. In 2016, Wirtz Beverage joined forces with New York-based Charmer Sunbelt to form Breakthru Beverage, a company with a portfolio that includes more wine and spirits than beer.Beer wholesalers have remained more independent in part because of state franchise laws that make it more difficult for suppliers to change distributors, said Eric Shepard, executive editor of Beer Marketer's Insights.Thompson, the consultant on the deal, said that isn't likely to change.\"These are largely family-owned businesses. I don't think this creates any dominoes effect,\" Thompson said.Representatives with Reyes Holdings couldn't be immediately reached for comment Thursday.gtrotter@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "236"}
{"content": "July 28--Here are five observations from Bears practice Friday, their second straight session in pads. Remember, these are snapshots of players working to improve, and they deserve our analytical leeway in the process.1. Accuracy on pitches and shovel passes was a point of emphasis for quarterback Mitch Trubisky.It's no secret that Matt Nagy's offense involves a variety of pitches and tosses by the quarterback. They require impeccable timing and accuracy to maximize the speed of Bears players, the precision and design of their blocking and the impact of any misdirection on the defense.You might recall how the 2017 Chiefs, for which Nagy was the offensive coordinator, found great success in the shovel pass to three-time Pro Bowl tight end Travis Kelce. Well, Trubisky will have to master that pass the same way quarterback Alex Smith did.That process is ongoing. On Friday during the install period, Nagy had Trubisky and the offense get back in the huddle and redo a rep of a tight end shovel pass. There are certain elements of the play that Trubisky must sell (the dropback, for example) in addition to executing his pass with the proper footwork, timing and accuracy. Success of the play, Nagy says, is in the details.Later in practice, Trubisky tossed an option pitch behind Jordan Howard, placing the ball on his back hip or butt instead of out in front of him. Howard turned his body but didn't catch it, and it resulted in a fumble.\"You have to be accurate,\" Nagy said. \"And you get bigger guys, bigger running backs, tight ends, guys that have these bigger shoulder pads -- if you throw anything behind them on the hip, it slows them up, and now it's a catch (and) tackle.\"In terms of putting (the ball) on him, right in front of him, (consider) do they have a guy trailing him? Are they running free? We teach that pinpoint accuracy. He'll get a feel for who these guys are, what their speed is. There were some inaccuracies today, but that's kind of natural, and he'll keep getting better at that.\"For me, Trubisky's best throw of the morning was a deep shot to rookie receiver Anthony Miller, who ran a double move and was open behind cornerback Kyle Fuller. Whether Fuller was supposed to have help wasn't evident, but Trubisky's timing with Miller was perfect, and the ball was out in front of him for a sure touchdown.Trubisky was intercepted by safety Deiondre' Hall on a pass that was tipped by a defensive lineman. He has been intercepted in all four padded practices.2. Trubisky is doing some things well that aren't evident to those of us unfamiliar with details of the playbook.While Trubisky has had obvious successes and growing pains in every practice, it's imperative we remember that the quality of his performance in games will depend on elements to which we, the public, are not privy. This offense has so many checks for the quarterback at the line of scrimmage, and so many options during a play for quarterbacks and receivers, that we'll never know Trubisky's full list of responsibilities on any given sequence.Of course, he ultimately will be judged on wins and how efficient the offense is. The subtle details add up to affect those quantifiable measures, so, yes, we'll have a fair indication of whether he's developing command of the offense. But it's important to keep in mind that more goes into a play than just throw and catch.To that point, Nagy was energized Friday.\"He had three plays today that he made some checks at the line of scrimmage,\" Nagy explained. \"I told him out there: We're building this puzzle right now, and each day we're trying to take one piece of the puzzle and put it up there. And then then before you know it, at the end of this thing, you have that puzzle put together.\"Today was a day where there were two or three pieces that he put together on that puzzle. Specifically, with a protection check, with routes that go with the protection check, he's seeing the field well. But he had some bad plays, too, and that's what I'm trying to do as a coach is let him know, hey, we're in this together.\"That was an insightful detail for Nagy to share about his quarterback's developmental process. A helpful reminder for us too.3. Allen Robinson showed his value as a red-zone threat with two touchdown catches from Trubisky.OK, so one of the plays would have been a sack if contacting the quarterback were allowed. But that aside. Robinson's quality in running routes, selling fakes and his long catch radius add up to a friendly target in tight confines closet to the goal line.Robinson first made a diving catch in the back of the end zone, yet another grab while going to the ground. That's something we're getting used to seeing. In fact, even at 6-foot-3, he has about a half-dozen catches going to the ground already in camp.\"Those are some of the tough ones, being a bigger receiver,\" Robinson said. \"For me, it's a little bit easier (when) balls are up in the air. But that's why they brought me here. My job is to make the quarterback's job as easy as possible. I do a lot of practicing as far as trying to catch some of the low balls -- getting different hip and knee bend to be able to go down and get those passes. My goal is to have the biggest target radius that I can have.\"In making these catches, Robinson has shown exceptional body control.\"Playing other sports has helped me out a lot -- playing basketball, baseball and doing some different things -- to create the body control and have the same focus getting those high passes and low ones,\" he said.A tangential point about the Trubisky-to-Robinson touchdown that would've been a sack: Trubisky threw it off-balance with a three-quarters arm slot. That's one of those funny-body throws that attracted the Bears to him.On Robinson's second touchdown catch from Trubisky, no adjustment was necessary. He was wide open to the post.4. Eddie Goldman's bull rush is in good form.The veteran nose tackle won back-to-back one-on-one pass-rush reps against center Cody Whitehair. On the first rush, Goldman got his hands inside Whitehair's and into Whitehair's body, and from there Goldman's brute strength is overwhelming.On the second rush, Goldman's quick feet enabled him to get on the edge of Whitehair. That shows the mix of strength and finesse that defensive line coach Jay Rodgers mentioned in an interview back in the spring.\"He's very explosive,\" Whitehair said after practice. \"Very good off the ball. He does a really nice job with his hands as well. He's making me better, that's for sure.\"Whitehair has faced Goldman for going on three seasons now, and he believes Goldman's hand placement and hand-fighting are his greatest improvements over that time.In fairness to Whitehair, the one-on-one pass-rush drills are disproportionately difficult on offensive linemen because they don't have blocking help or the design of the scheme to aid the quarterback in getting the ball out. But it's helpful technique work. And Whitehair later stopped Goldman on a rep by shuffling his feet quickly to combat Goldman's spin move.5. Tarik Cohen provides the sizzle to go along with the steak.The running back/receiver caught a dart from Chase Daniel down the right sideline for a 60-yard touchdown. Great read by Daniel with Cohen behind the defense, and a perfect low-arcing, strong throw that didn't allow any disruption from a safety inside.Cohen ran to the end zone, stood there for just a second and then did a standing backflip. Stuck the two-footed landing. Mind you, this was 2 hours and 25 minutes after practice began. No one's legs were fresh at that point.Now that's entertainment.Participation report: Rookie linebacker Kylie Fitts (arm) and veteran center Hroniss Grasu (calf) sat out. Nagy indicated they'll be out a while.\"We're going through the timeline now of how long,\" he said, \"but they'll be some time now.\"Also out: Linebackers Danny Trevathan (hamstring) and Aaron Lynch (hamstring), tight end Ben Braunecker (hamstring), cornerbacks Sherrick McManis (hamstring) and Kevin Tolliver (quad) and guard Kyle Long (rest day).rcampbell@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "237"}
{"content": "Aug. 03--The 4,097-word Bleacher Report profile on 49ers quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo landed with a thud in the great wide ether about 10 days ago. Chockablock with details, anecdotes and insider information, it doesn't leave you wanting.Most people were attracted, like moths to a flame, to the passage where Garoppolo discussed the confidence that led him to believe he was better than his New England Patriots' teammate Tom Brady.\"I've always had that mindset. I know that (Brady) was better than me in my first day in the NFL,\" Garoppolo told author Joon Lee. \"Naturally, you're the rookie and he's the veteran, but you have to have that mindset, that you want to be the starter.\"Even when I was a little kid, my brothers, whenever we would play, I would literally always think I was going to win. I wouldn't, but I would always think that. It's like when I go to New England, when I first got there, I think in my head, 'I'm better than this dude.'\"Garoppolo's nuanced explanation was dumbed down by those who stammered and sputtered at the thought of any quarterback articulating such blasphemy. But I digress.Meanwhile, a fairly incredible passage flew under the radar, even though it led the story. The morning after Garoppolo was traded to the 49ers, he was in a limo headed for the airport where a private plane awaited. He almost never got there.\"That's when the unexpected nightmare began,\" Lee wrote. \"Another car exited the highway, skidded off the side of the ramp, turned straight toward Jimmy's door.\"The limo driver \"bailed into a ditch\" to avoid being T-boned by the skidding vehicle. \"Can you imagine that story if we got hit leaving here?\" the limo driver asked Garoppolo, according to Lee.Garoppolo's reaction: \"Holy (expletive), what just happened?\"\"What does someone do right after he almost dies, 10 hours after being traded out of Tom Brady's shadow?\" Lee wrote.Thankfully we'll get a chance to find out.___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "238"}
{"content": "A new study from Georgia Tech revealed that dehydration affects mental performance. People who are finding it hard to focus or struggling with motor coordination may want to try drinking water to see if it helps. ( Olichel Adamovich | Pixabay )Dehydration apparently not only affects the physical well-being of people, but also their mental performance, according to a new study from the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.How much water to drink in a day? The answer to that question is not as simple as eight glasses. Too little risks dehydration, while too much may lead to water intoxication. Nevertheless, people who find it hard to focus might want to try drinking water and see if it was dehydration causing their mental lapses.Dehydration Effects On The BrainAccording to a new study published in the Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise journal, dehydration impairs cognitive performance, particularly in tasks that involve attention, executive function, and motor coordination. These activities are affected when water deficits exceed 2 percent body mass loss, the study claimed, after the researchers analyzed data from several peer-reviewed research papers on dehydration and cognitive ability.\"We find that when people are mildly dehydrated they really don't do as well on tasks that require complex processing or on tasks that require a lot of their attention,\" said Georgia Tech's Exercise Physiology Laboratory director Mindy Millard-Stafford.As subjects got more dehydrated, most of them increasingly made mistakes in attention-related tasks that were unexciting and repetitive, such as pressing a button in different patterns for several minutes. Real-world cases of such activities include focusing during a long meeting, driving a car, or doing a monotonous job in a factory.The researchers expressed concern that dehydration may lead to accidents, particularly in scenarios where people heavily sweat in dangerous environments such as around heavy machinery.Benefits Of Drinking WaterFor average-sized people, 2 percent dehydration, which is when mental performance drops off, is equivalent to sweating out about a liter of water. That might sound a lot of sweat, but it actually happens faster than most people would think.\"Most people don't realize how high their sweat rate is in the heat,\" said University of Connecticut professor of kinesiology and Korey Stringer Institute CEO Doug Casa. \"If you're going hard during a run, you can reach that level of dehydration in about 30 minutes.\"What this means is that, for people to maintain proper physical and mental performance, drinking water regularly, especially when outside on hot days, is a necessity.Drinking water may not have been a top result when asking how to improve mental ability, but the new study shows that addressing dehydration is a possible answer.", "id": "239"}

Here is how you can watch it happen.Asdrubal Cabrera will make his  debut Saturday night against the Reds. He is in the starting lineup at shortstop replacing Scott Kingery, batting fifth.Philadelphia acquired Cabrera from the Mets Friday in exchange for pitching prospect Franklyn Kilome. Kilome was the team\u2019s 10th-best prospect according to MLB.com before the trade.Here is all the info you need to watch Cabrera\u2019s debut:Date: July 28, 2018First Pitch: 6:40 PM ETLocation: Cincinnati, OhioStadium: Great American Ball ParkPitchers: Vince Velasquez (7-8, 4.05 ERA) vs Matt Harvey (5-6, 5.21 ERA)Radio Station: 94 WIP, WTTM 1680; WLW 700, Reds Radio NetworkTV Channel: NBC 10; FS-OSaturday will be the first time Cabrera has played shortstop in a year. He last played there July 27 last year and hasn\u2019t been a full-time shortstop since 2016. His defense there is poor, which certainly won\u2019t help this defense-deficient team. However, he is expected to move all around the infield, lessening his defensive impact.In 98 games with the Mets this year, Cabrera hit 18 home runs, drove in 58 runs, hit .277, and had an .817 OPS (125 OPS+). His batting average is better than any other Phillie, while his OPS and home runs are outclassed only by Rhys Hoskins. His bat is a huge pickup for this team, especially considering the lack of production they have gotten from the shortstop position.Cabrera will be facing off against a former teammate in Harvey. After being released by the Mets, Harvey has been better, but not great, with the Reds. In 13 starts, he has a 4.50 ERA, 5-4 record, 1.221 WHIP, and 3.40 strikeout-to-walk ratio. Those numbers are at least better than his last two seasons in New York.This will be the first time Velasquez ever faces the Reds. He threw seven shutout innings in his last start against the Padres, striking out seven. His last outing was Tuesday night against the Dodgers, finishing out a 16-inning marathon of a game. In his last five appearances, Velasquez has a 1.23 ERA, 21 strikeouts, and eight walks in 22 innings.", "id": "241"}
{"content": "As the stock market claws its way back toward the January peak, inflationary pressures and subtle market divergences continue to mount. The Federal Reserve is walking a tight rope between too much and too little restraint, and the inflationary backdrop depicted in this issue shows how precarious that balancing act may turn out to be. If underlying pressures in the form of manufacturing costs and wage increases continue to rise, the Fed's strategy of \"gradualism\" in interest rate increases could go by the wayside. Another risk that will surely blindside investors when the final market turning point comes is the excessive concentration of assets and recent gains in large-cap growth stocks, courtesy of today's indexing phenomenon. Although the Advance-Decline Line continues to hit new highs, indicating that a broad number of stocks are participating in this recovery, investors are concentrating on the large-cap favorites, driving them further into momentum territory. Yet, these high-growth stocks \u2014 like Netflix (NFLX) , Facebook  (FB) , and Amazon (AMZN)  \u2014  are clearly priced on lofty expectations, and history tells us that the current momentum-driven leadership won't last. Ultimately, value stocks will come back into vogue, and perhaps sooner than anyone thinks.  As Warren Buffett stated back in the heady days of the 1990s Tech Bubble back in November 1999, \"The fact is that markets behave in ways, sometimes for a very long stretch, that are not linked to value. Sooner or later, though, value counts.\" And he was right. While technology stocks and large-cap growth funds dominated the landscape during the late 1990s, the tables turned abruptly in March 2000. Over the next 31 months, the S&amp;P 500 Growth Index lost half its value, dropping 49.1% - nearly twice the decline in the Value Index. Although value holdings won't come through a severe bear market unscathed, it's a historical fact that momentum stocks, which typically lead prior to market peaks, will be among the first and the hardest hit when the music finally stops. Consequently, with this bull market likely in its ninth year, this is not the time to reach for excess profits, particularly with companies where growth projections rely on a booming economy. It's fine to have growth-oriented sectors in the portfolio, but they should be kept to less than market-weighting and be balanced with a healthy allocation to defensive sectors. Most importantly, the overall portfolio allocation to the stock market should be in line with the current risks, with an emphasis on traditional late-stage and less cyclical sectors.  Over my decades of investing experience, I have found that every bull market has \"a hook\" that keeps even the most intelligent and diligent investors fully committed and invested at the top. In 1972 it was the \"one-decision\" Nifty Fifty stocks that you could buy and hold forever. In the Tech Bubble of the 1990s, it was the almost universal belief that \"this time is different\" in that valuations didn't matter. And at the last market top in 2007, bullish market pundits clung to the fact that the Federal Reserve had already made their first interest rate cut before the market peaked, and that a bear market had never started when interest rates were falling. After listening to Charles Schwab's top domestic and international strategists at a recent Schwab conference for principals of money management firms, we may have found the hook that traps even the brightest minds this time around. The dangerous relationship between a flattening yield curve and a probable bear market has become widely known on Wall Street. In fact, it has all the top analysts watching for the inevitable inversion of the 10-year T-bond yield minus the 3-month T-bill rate that would confirm the next bear market and recession. Theoretically, we would have to see this yield spread turn negative before the next bear market or recession. At least that is what everyone on Wall Street believes. As devoted market historians, we have to question whether this misplaced confidence could turn out to be the ultimate hook in this current bull market. If so, there are going to be a lot of very perplexed and frustrated analysts, money managers, and investors on the bear market ride down!

{"content": "Aug. 02--Shortly after Terrell Owens was elected to the Pro Hall of Fame, in his third year of eligibility, former 49ers executive Carmen Policy called with congratulations. It was a delightful chat. \"He was bubbly,\" Policy said. \"Forgive my use of the term, but he was adorable in our conversation.\"The two reminisced about Owens' early days as a painfully quiet third-round pick in the 1996 draft. But because he knows Owens' longtime knack for torching relationships, Policy also offered some advice. He told the receiver to embrace the Hall of Fame community because it offered him a chance at a new football family, one that would grow with each new induction class. \"Let it be a steppingstone to make your life better,\" Policy instructed.No such luck. Owens doused the good vibes in lighter fluid and struck the match even before this Saturday's induction day. Stung by not being a first-ballot selection, the NFL's all-time second leading receiver will forego his own Hall of Fame ceremony, the first inductee ever to reject an invitation.Instead, Owens arranged a podium for himself at his alma mater, the University of Tennessee-Chattanooga, where he will make an induction speech on his own terms. As he tweeted Monday: \"It means I'm in control and not the media or anyone else that feels slighted or (that) I'm doing something wrong.\"The decision left Hall of Fame officials taken aback. They will counter by limiting the focus Saturday to the honorees who actually show up in Canton, Ohio. Owens, who caught more touchdown passes than anyone except Jerry Rice and Randy Moss, will be reduced to a footnote. The Hall of Fame will send him his Gold Jacket.That things would combust like this for \"T.O.\" is no surprise. T.O. was the tempestuous showboat who angered opponents, danced on the Dallas star, berated coaches and clashed with teammates. Such behavior is why it took him so long to get elected to the Hall of Fame in the first place.But for those who know Terrell Owens, the sensitive and shy kid from rural Alabama, the state of affairs remains shocking. You see, in his early days, before the T.O. persona bulldozed his reputation, Terrell Owens was actually one heck of a sweet guy.\"He burned all of his bridges and now no one can get to him. And he can't get to anyone else to enjoy this great, great honor in his life,\" Policy said. \"He just didn't have a human compass to point him in the right direction.\"Gary Plummer, a veteran linebacker, watched the entire transformation. He met Owens back when the 89th overall pick was an ego-free rookie willing to play special teams.\"He was an introverted, well-mannered nice kid when he first came in. He ended up being an extroverted, angry, bitter human being,\" Plummer said. \"He clearly experienced wealth that he never could have imagined growing up in Alabama. He was able to do things for family and friends that he never dreamed of.\"And instead of showing appreciation for that, it's just a middle finger to the world. That's a bad legacy. I think it's just a big f-- you to the NFL and f-- you to Philly and f-- you to San Francisco and f-- you to every coach. It's just who he's become.\"Still, Plummer remains sympathetic. He believes Owens' sheltered and traumatic childhood in Alexander City, Alabama, left the receiver unprepared for the machinery of fame, money and media. Plummer cited the trend of bankruptcy among ex-NFL players as evidence that even savvy city-slickers can get derailed by the league's trappings. Owens, with his naivet\u00e9, never stood a chance.\"I absolutely feel like this is something that happened to him,\" Plummer said. \"I could see his edge just start to harden the longer he was a starter. And, of course, getting the money and things like that. Then it was not this gradual descent into darkness. It was full-on conspiracy mode -- 'Gather the troops and circle the wagons. Everybody is against me.' And once he got into that, it was over. Nothing was going to change that.\"# # #Owens' bitter ending with the 49ers makes for a difficult hagiography. These Hall of Fame induction preview stories typically overflow with fond memories and vivid accounts of old glory. With Owens, the phone barely rings. There's a veritable \"who's who\" of who didn't call back. Other members of 49ers family, like former coach Steve Mariucci, \"respectfully declined\" to discuss Owens' time in San Francisco.The tension is mutual. When TMZ asked Owens which team he would represent in Canton, he said: \"Well, it won't be the 49ers.\" The receiver later elaborated in a tweet: \"There's NO LOYALTY with organizations, so why should I have any. I gave 181 percent to that organization with no reciprocity.\"But a handful of his 49ers teammates remain loyal, including at least two, Junior Bryant and Derrick Deese, who plan on traveling to Owens' celebration in Chattanooga this weekend. \"I want to go back and support him,\" Bryant said.And Owens certainly fit into the team's inner circle on Wednesday at a memorial for Dwight Clark at Grace Cathedral in San Francisco. Clark, the former 49ers receiver later who became the team's general manager, drafted Owens with a late-third round pick. So Owens paid his respects, then stuck around for the private reception, chatting amiably with Joe Montana and Jerry Rice, now his fellow Hall of Famers.Bryant, in a phone interview, said Owens was a role model for work ethic during his 49ers days (a point on which even Owens' detractors agree). He said while many players pay lip service to giving it their all in practice, Owens actually did it. And in doing so, Owens earned his place among top players ever to play a star-studded position.\"My attitude is that he played hard and he wanted to win,\" Bryant said. \"I just know what he did and what he brought. ... Anybody who thinks he doesn't belong in the Hall of Fame is just being intellectually dishonest.\"As for those antics? Bryant noted that star receivers, as a demographic, aren't exactly shrinking violets. And he said the mild-mannered Terrell Owens is the one he still sees most often, even now that the cameras are off. When Bryant and Deese organized a benefit in the Bay Area for the Navy Seals Foundation last Sept. 11, Owens was there.\"T.O is going to do whatever he can to help former teammates, especially when it comes to a worthy charity,\" said Deese, a 49ers offensive lineman from 1994-2003. \"That's a side that people don't know about. He gives a lot. ... If people spent three or four days with him, they would find out that so many of the things that are said or written about him aren't true.\"Ray Brown, now the offensive line coach for the Arizona Cardinals, blocked for Owens from 1996-2001 and had an uncommon bond with the receiver. \"He was from the South, which I liked,\" said Brown, an Arkansas native, recalling their first meeting. \"He was just a wide-eyed, bushy-tailed dude, 'yes, sir,' 'no, sir' dude.\"Like Bryant, Brown realized Owens played with an edge. But Brown was one of the few players on the team who could get T.O. to take it down a notch. \"I'd just appeal to him with kindness and buttered him up,\" Brown said by phone Monday. \"I'd just say, 'Come on, man, you can't do that.' I thought he was a great teammate. I enjoyed him. T.O. worked his butt off and he produced. He should have been a first-ballot guy.\"# # #The Hall of Fame arranged for this year's induction class to speak to the media via conference call, another ritual that Owens declined. But the six-time Pro Bowl selection did speak by phone with longtime 49ers beat reporter Matt Maiocco, now of NBC Bay Area, who wrote the Owens profile for the official Induction Weekend program.It helps that Maiocco knew the shy kid, too. In his first full-length profile of Owens, for the Oakland Tribune on Aug. 7, 1996, Maiocco wrote largely about the receiver's down-to-earth personality. Under the headline, \"Mom taught 49ers rookie well,\" he penned these lines:\"Owens isn't the sort to blow a large chunk of change on fancy sports cars or other luxuries. He knows not to take instant wealth for granted. ... Owens addresses elders as 'Sir.' Instead of being an exception, the rookie believes the way he was taught should be a standard for the younger generation. 'I feel like it's respectful,' Owens said.\"By 1998, the kid who eschewed flashy purchases rolled into the 49ers' practice facility with a white Cadillac Escalade and the personalized license plate: XPOSUR. But Maiocco remembers at least one thing that never changed, no matter whether it was Terrell Owens or T.O.\"He never lied,\" he said. \"He didn't have a diplomatic bone in his body. He wasn't going to sugar coat it. He wouldn't use a filter.\"Over the years, Owens emerged an extreme case, a player whose behavior was so outrageous that it threatened to undermine his Hall of Fame talent. Even eight years after his last snap, his havoc-to-yardage ratio still prevents him from taking a proper bow.How did it come to this? It's never easy to find answers with someone as complicated as Owens, but those who witnessed his personality change during his 49ers days generally choose from the same menu of life-altering events:The Jerry Rice DynamicOwens wore No. 80 while at Chattanooga because he idolized the greatest receiver of all time. The 49ers front office saw the connection, too, and it was no coincidence Owens ended up in San Francisco. Clark and personnel chief Vinny Cerrato understood that Rice had also been a small-school standout, at Mississippi Valley State, and figured he'd be ideal to mentor another diamond in the rough.For the most part, it was an ideal pairing. Owens had the fire and the discipline to work just as tirelessly as Rice, which was no small feat. \"And that's where you need to give T.O. the credit,\" Policy said. \"He had this innate sense of wanting to be at the top of the game. He was bent on becoming the next Jerry and he never, ever showed a disrespectful side to Jerry. Jerry maintained, shall we say, an almost a fatherly image to him.\"But there was a downside, too. Rice was a superstar receiver with an ego to match. At times, he demanded the ball, yelled at his quarterback and fumed at his coaches. As ESPN the Magazine writer, Tom Friend observed: \"And T.O. noticed Rice was never vilified for it. He watched Rice sign autographs and drive away in a Bentley. That's who T.O. wanted to be, dammit. The sooner the better.\"By the time Owens took over as the 49ers primary receiver, he'd learned from his mentor how to grab the spotlight in good times and how to unleash his frustration when things went bad. But he lacked Rice's charm and diplomacy, his ability so smooth things out after an outburst.\"Exactly,\" Policy said. \"To rise to the top takes hard work and talent. But there's a third element that goes into it in order to maintain your position and bring others along with you. Jerry had that third element. Call it \"It\" -- call it whatever you want -- but T.O. never seemed to have it or develop it.\"T.O. taking on the role of the No. 1 guy started a transformation that lacked control, structure, discipline and balance. And that's when things started to head south for him.\"It's comical now to look back on what Owens said in his first camp without Rice in the fold. The 49ers saved $2.5 million against the cap by releasing Rice and allowing him to go to the Raiders in 2001, and Owens practically breathed a sigh of relief that his hero was gone. It couldn't have been easy for either man when, in Rice's final home game with the 49ers, it was Owens who played the starring role, breaking a 50-year-old NFL record with 20 catches for 283 yards.\"I think it was to a point with a lot of his outbursts and the way he wanted the ball a lot, it had become a distraction,\" Owens said, as quoted in a San Jose Mercury story on Aug. 1, 2001. \"There were incidents where he got in Coach's face, this and that. That kind of thing happens in the heat of battle. You know, J.J. (Stokes) had some frustrations, too. But he made his point in a more subtle way.\"The Dallas StarIn Dallas, on Sept. 24, 2000, the receiver twice made infamous runs to the midfield star after a touchdown. The second time, Cowboys safety George Teague rammed him from behind. It started a melee on the field -- and a team-wide cringe along the 49ers sideline.In the aftermath of the 41-24 victory, Mariucci told the team: \"We're not going to play that way. We're not going to win that way. We're not going to lose that way.\" But Owens considered any criticism a betrayal. In his mind, scoring two touchdowns over the dreaded rivals represented a triumph for the 49ers organization -- and now he felt as if no one had his back.Mariucci ultimately suspended Owens for a week and fined him $24,294, one week's pay. As the coach explained later, he did so as a pre-emptive strike before the NFL office could level even more severe penalties. As Deese (who can be seen in replays as the first player to join the fray against Teague) said: \"Mooch was trying to step in and stop something that could have been a lot worse. If it's the league, it's maybe three or four games. ... But T.O. still didn't like it. He took it personally.\"Mariucci told the NFL Network in 2017 that he made a tactical error in not having the punitive moves come from the front office or ownership. He did it personally, as a coach: \"We had friction from then on,\" he said on The Rich Eisen Show.In fact, 18 years later, Owens is still steamed. \"The relationship that I had with Mariucci, it was fractured, I think, the day after he suspended me for going to the star,\" Owens told Maiocco for a podcast.Owens added: \"There was so much hoopla and so much media attention around what I did when I went to the star that he felt pressured or compelled to suspend me. It wasn't that the league suspended me. He suspended me.\"Owens' demeanor was noticeably more surly after that, in the locker room and in the press.'The $10 Million Catch'In a playoff game against the Green Bay Packers on Jan. 3, 1999, Owens dropped four passes and also lost a fumble. But he found Young along the sidelines and pleaded, \"Steve, believe in me.\"And when the game was on the line, with three seconds left, Young found Owens at the goal line just as two Packers crunched him like wrecking balls. The 49ers won 30-27 as Owens cried tears of joy under an avalanche of giddy teammates. \"At the bottom of the pile,\" Owens said that day, \"I was just saying, 'Thank you, Jesus.'\"For Owens, it was a boost to his confidence -- and his pocketbook. By the start of the next season, he had a $34.2 million deal that included a $7.5 million signing bonus.\"I called it the $10 million catch,\" said his agent at the time, David Joseph, \"and the residual may be more than that.\"Terrell Jones, the former strength coach, recalls sitting outside the 49ers defensive meeting room on the day Owens attended a press conference to announce the contract extension. Jones said he was chatting with conditioning coach Mike Barnes when Owens blew by without saying hi to either of them. They teased him about the snub.\"T.O. turned around and he said, 'I hate the way that my money changes people,\"' Jones said. \"We looked at him like, 'What? We're just busting your balls for not saying hi.' He turned around and kept walking. We were both like, 'Well, this is interesting.\"'It only got worse from there.\"It seemed like after he signed that contract, that's when he went downhill,\" Jones said. \"He was getting into fights with players. He was getting into fights with coaches. In my eight years, I never saw one player get in more fights with his teammates. There were times when I saw players chase him out of the locker room because they wanted to fight him.\"Friend, in his profile for ESPN the Magazine, wrote that after the Green Bay catch, Owens began craving attention. The receiver got his teeth fixed, for possible endorsements. He bought stylish clothes. He got a new personalized license plate: Catch II. To a lot of people in the organization, the touchdown had changed the kid forever. \"Before the catch, he was Terrell Owens,\" one source said. \"After the catch, he became T.O.\"Policy, in our phone interview, also identified the Green Bay catch as a seminal moment.\"Now you've got money, the elevation from a stellar performance in a particular high-profile game, and that combination is all kicking in,\" he said. \"So he had all that energy. It's kind of like having nuclear energy without any proper controls and safeguards. He just had all of that energy spreading out and it created some significant negative fallout.\"More than one source said that in the wake of stardom and money, Owens wanted to operate under a different set of rules, rebelling against guidelines large and small. In 2003, the 49ers struggled with an outbreak of staph infections after a game against the St. Louis Rams. The Centers for Disease Control advised the 49ers to scrub down their weight room twice daily. Along with other safeguards, players were required to wear shirts while working out.\"So T.O. was in there one day and I said, 'Hey, T.O, you have to put a shirt on. It's policy,'\" Jones recalled. \"He said, 'Well, this isn't 24 Hour Fitness.' I said, 'Yeah, you're right, but you have to wear a shirt and put a towel down. So he huffed and puffed and started calling me names.'\"Owens eventually relented, but Jones said the receiver confronted him again when the workout was over. Jones said he let it slide when Owens called him an \"Uncle Tom\" but nearly came to blows when T.O started saying things about his parents.\"My dad died when I was 2 years old,\" Jones said. \"And he knew this because I'd told him before. You can say anything you want about me, but don't say anything about my parents. And I came out of that door and I was pissed ... Teammates came to my defense, but that's the kind of guy he was. If he didn't get his way, he would verbally assault you.\"The Media BurnPlummer said what really flipped Owens' switch was the way the media delved into his early childhood. Owens later shared the harrowing details on his own terms, in his autobiography, \"Catch This!\" He was born in Alexander City, Alabama, and mostly raised by a grandmother who was so protective that she allowed Terrell to leave the yard only to attend church or school. Even when he got a bicycle, he was not allowed to ride it past the driveway.In his book, he does not recall hearing the words \"I love you\" from his mother or anyone else. Most devastatingly, when he was 11 he had a crush on the girl across the street. But the girl's father instructed him to stay away. Why? Because that was his half-sister.\"It took me a while to understand that I was talking to my father,\" Owens wrote. When he asked his mother why she'd never told him that the man across the street was his father, she said that \"it wasn't necessary to explain everything to me.\"The way Plummer remembers it, that story first surfaced in the media after Owens divulged the information in a conversation he considered off-the-record. But a writer ran with it anyway, and other outlets followed suit. Suddenly, the naive and trusting kid was shattered forever, according to Plummer.\"He was furious,\" Plummer said. \"That was the genesis of his hatred toward the media. I will always believe that had that not happened, T.O. would have been a completely different guy. It's sad. And literally -- for him -- it wasn't a bell curve. It was like dropping off of a cliff.\"Outside the HallDavid Baker, the president and CEO of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, told NFL.com that Owens' image will be on banners hanging around the Hall's campus and on the video boards of the main stage. Baker also said the he welcomes Owens any time he's ready. \"The Hall of Fame and my successor's successor will always guard his legacy, just like every Hall of Famer,\" Baker said.Until then, Owens' friends from a more innocent time with the 49ers can barely fathom how this joyous occasion turned so sour. In a 2012 interview with GQ, Owens said that almost all of the $80 million he made during his career was gone, swallowed up by bad investments. In a recent tweet, Owens said that he didn't \"blow\" through that amount of money but rather \"those that I hired 'mismanaged and misappropriated' funds. Through my experiences I continue to share with athletes in and entering into the league to avoid similar circumstances.\"Policy, meanwhile, alluded to T.O.'s financial situation in recounting his congratulatory phone call.\"I wished him the best and I felt really, really terrible about his state of personal affairs. Because he's kind of up against it,\" he said. \"Things aren't going well for him in any way, shape or form. I think he's kind of depressed and he's certainly dejected.\"But Deese struck a more optimistic note.\"I believe this is his day, it's his honor, and the way he chooses to celebrate it is totally up to him,\" he said. \"I'm going to support him in any way I can, regardless of where it is.\"___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "243"}
{"content": "July 25--Even in a crowded field of distinctive voices emerging out of Chicago hip-hop, Valee stands out. He's not the loudest or flashiest MC. On the contrary, he just may be the quietest, the most subtle. His songs appear, dust the environment around your ears with whispers and implications, and then vanish only a minute or two later.\"People say it's a quiet flow, that it sounds like I'm in a library,\" Valee says. \"That could have come from when I was living in my old place, a nice loft. I was the youngest person in the building and I would be working alone on my music. I would get emails two or three times a month about 'loud' music, so I became quieter and quieter about making beats. It was a necessity not to irritate my neighbors.\"He also reminisces about listening to his mother's favorite singers -- Sade and Whitney Houston -- when he was a kid growing up on the South Side in the '90s. \"I love Whitney, but her music could get on my nerves -- so much loudness, yelling,\" he says. \"Sade never got on my nerves. I don't want to get on people's nerves. I try to put myself in other people's shoes. Why don't you like this song? If I play somebody's mixtape, if it gets on my nerves halfway through because it's too loud or everything sounds the same, it makes me want to approach every song I do differently. I don't want somebody saying, 'That's enough of this,' when they listen to my music.\"Now listeners can't seem to get enough of it. Valee emerged with a 2016 song, \"Shell,\" that caused a major ripple for its stylistic daring, its idiosyncratic yet fully formed execution. It takes the ominous elements of trap and strips them down to its rawest essentials. The words are seemingly about nothing special, and yet they resonate almost in spite of themselves: \"Walked out Gucci, then crossed the street/ Upset stomach, I had to eat.\" The line is punctuated by a groan -- \"ooh\" -- that becomes a subtle hook, delivered with all the urgency of someone waking up from a nap. It's over in 109 seconds. The accompanying video has become just as iconic, a slow-motion slice of life (Valee opening a garage door and climbing into a vintage Chevrolet) that stands in stark contrast to most boisterous, quick-edit hip-hop visuals.\"Living in Chicago you have got to not be afraid about failing at something,\" Valee says. \"At the time we had Chief Keef and Lil Durk coming out. Keef is doing videos with all these people in the street, and I couldn't do something like that. I didn't know how to shoot videos when it ('Shell') came time. I worked really hard on making good music, and the right videographers came to me. They helped me put out relaxed videos, where I'm not jumping up and down, doing more slo-mo. I don't want to make videos that come out looking like commercials or movie trailers.\"Two years later, Valee has a record deal with Kanye West's G.O.O.D. Music label and released his first EP for the label in March, \"Good Job, You Found Me.\" Since then, he's continued to drop singles and is also working on a full-length album. It wasn't necessarily the life Valee envisioned for himself when he was a teenager growing up on the South Side, even though he dabbled in music for about two years.While in high school, Valee Taylor learned how to make beats from a neighbor and formed a rap group with three friends. He recorded a few of the group's songs on his computer, but when it crashed, he lost interest and began devoting his time to fixing cars. At various times he's also worked as an electrician and carpenter.He was making a comfortable living and had no aspirations to get back into music as he rolled into his 20s. One weekend when he got bored, he hopped into his car and on a whim veered into a Guitar Center and bought himself a bunch of recording gear. It was a lark that turned into an obsession.\"It was frustrating at first after I hooked up the gear, rewired a bunch of stuff and downloaded beatmaking software,\" he says. \"I was teaching myself how to make these things sound like I imagined them to sound, and that took a while. But when I get into something, I get obsessed with it to the point where nothing else matters. When you're in the middle of it, you forget about how long it's taking. You dive in and you have no choice but to get better. There was nothing else to do, and you're never satisfied.\"Valee knew his approach, his subject matter would have to be different to matter to anyone.\"In rap a lot of people are saying the same thing, so I have to say it differently,\" he says. \"To get beyond that, I knew each sentence I rap had to make sense, had to paint its own story. You had to be able to picture yourself doing it and not just say stuff to get you through a verse.\"In addition to making every word count, the producer-MC put a premium on brevity.\"I would be with friends of mine who definitely would tune out on a pretty big artist once the song got to the second verse,\" he says. \"I'd think this person (rapper) paid a lot of money for this video, but my friends, who are fans of hip-hop, couldn't care less about the next minute and half of this expensive video. I want to keep people involved, I want them to care.\"It's why he's being careful about his next move, even as he continues to drop distinctive singles such as \"Womp Womp\" (with Jeremih) and \"Loading.\" Patience, he has found, has its rewards.\"I'm glad that I'm not putting out a full-length yet,\" he says. \"With a little bit of waiting, something extra will come up.\"Greg Kot co-hosts \"Sound Opinions\" at 8 p.m. Friday, 7 p.m. Saturday and 2 p.m. Sunday.Greg Kot is a Tribune critic.greg@gregkot.comWhen: 12:50 p.m. ThursdayWhere: Lollapalooza, Grant Park, Monroe Street and Michigan AvenueTickets: $120; www.lollapalooza.comWhen: 6:30 p.m. Aug. 8Where: House of Blues, 329 N.

{"content": "Facebook has resumed wider testing for its new upvote and downvote system. Instead of disliking a comment, users will be able to cast votes a la Reddit. ( Thomas Ulrich | Pixabay )Back in May, reports surfaced saying Facebook was testing a downvote button in the style of Reddit, where comments with the most votes get bumped to the top, while those with negative points get buried underneath the pile.Well, it seems early testing has yielded successful results, as Facebook is now apparently rolling the feature out to more users in the United States. It's been appearing on the mobile app to more accounts recently, without prior warning whatsoever.How The Upvote/Downvote System On Facebook WorksIn an article, Ars Technica detailed how it works. The feature is limited to public posts for now. Participants in the test will see every comment thread now embedded with a numeric value for each comment and small up and down comments indicating upvotes and downvotes, respectively.\"Support comments that are thoughtful, and demote ones that are uncivil or irrelevant\" is the prompt that appears to inform the user about the feature.Upvotes and downvotes aren't replacing Facebook's existing emotion reactions but will be added on top of them. That means users can react with emojis and upvote or downvote at the same time. Liking a comment is also separate from the upvote/downvote system, which means users can hit like on a comment and still downvote it. The like will still count.As of writing, Ars Technica notes that the feature simply won't appear unless Facebook has specifically flagged an account as part of its testing. It has not gone live on any versions of the Facebook app for Android as well.Aside from the United States, other countries such as Australia and New Zealand have seen wider tests since this past April, while only a select number of U.S. accounts got to try it out as early as February. There seems to be some variation when it comes to prompts too. In other countries, for example, certain prompts appear when doing actions, such as, \"stop bad comments\" when tapping the downvote button or \"Press the down arrow if a comment has bad intentions or is disrespectful. It's still okay to disagree in a respectful way.\" These messages don't seem to be appearing in the U.S. tests, and it's unclear exactly why.Better Than Dislike Button?The upvote/downvote system is a logical compromise to a full-fledged \"dislike\" button, which CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in 2015 would come to the platform eventually, but that turned out to be the emotion reactions that launched later that year. A dislike button probably would encourage more hatred, though \u2014 as if there's not enough of that on Facebook already.There's no clear indication of or when the feature will roll out to all.", "id": "246"}

{"content": "July 27--President Donald Trump returned to Illinois on Thursday for his first visit since becoming president, taking a victory lap at a U.S. Steel plant in Downstate Granite City, where officials have credited his steel and aluminum tariffs for allowing the facility to re-open.Speaking to the invitation-only crowd gathered at a warehouse on the plant grounds, Trump said he was \"here to celebrate a great victory.\"\"After years of shutdowns and cutbacks, today the blast furnace here in Granite City is blazing bright, workers are back on the job, and we are once again pouring new American steel back into the spine of our country,\" he said.The president's visit comes amid a growing divide about his administration's trade policies. That includes billions of dollars in tariffs on goods from China, which has helped the local steel industry but hurt the state's soybean farmers, who ship more to China than any other state. As the U.S. has imposed tariffs on Chinese products, China has responded by slapping retaliatory tariffs on American exports, such as Illinois soybeans.\"China tried to hurt the American farmer, because that way they were going to hurt me,\" Trump said. \"And that way, you would go in November and you would vote for people that don't want borders, they don't care about crime, they want to get rid of ICE, Democrats.\"Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner wasn't on hand for Trump's stop in Granite City, which is located near St. Louis along the banks of the Mississippi River. Instead, he signed tax credit legislation at a ceremony about two and a half hours away in Peoria. Trump didn't mention Rauner in his speech but was greeted by Missouri Gov. Mike Parson upon landing at the St. Louis airport.While Rauner has credited Trump and Vice President Mike Pence for a \"roaring\" economy and said it was \"outstanding\" that the steel plant is reopening after closing in 2015, he's also expressed concerns about the administration's positions on trade.\"I support the effort to change our trade agreements,\" Rauner said this week. \"But I do not support us getting into a trade war.\"Rauner has shown support for the Trump administration recently after spending most of his term trying to keep his distance. The governor narrowly won the March GOP primary over state Rep. Jeanne Ives of Wheaton and has tried to unify conservative voters before the November election against Democrat J.B. Pritzker and third-party contender Sen. Sam McCann, a Trump backer.Pritzker released a statement calling Rauner a \"cowardly governor\" who has \"been everything from Trump's silent partner to his biggest cheerleader\" in working \"lockstep with this president's attacks on healthcare and attempts to undermine working families across our state.\"\"When I'm governor, Illinois will be a firewall against this administration's devastation,\" Pritzker said. Trump's visit to Illinois came a day after he and officials from the European Union announced they had agreed to discuss tearing down all tariffs, trade barriers and subsidies on non-auto industrial goods.The trip also was aimed at boosting the fortunes of two Republican congressmen facing tough contests in a region of Illinois supportive of the president.The steel plant is in the congressional district of Republican U.S. Rep. Mike Bost of Murphysboro, who arrived with Trump on Air Force One. He's facing Democratic challenger Brendan Kelly, the St. Clair County state's attorney.Also attending was U.S. Rep. Rodney Davis, a Republican from Taylorville who is being challenged by Democrat Betsy Dirksen Londrigan of Springfield in another closely watched Downstate race. The dean of the state's House delegation, Republican U.S. Rep. John Shimkus of Collinsville, also was present.\"Farmers and producers in this area have invested in this president and this administration with their votes, and they wanted to see results, and they saw results yesterday,\" Davis said of the EU agreement.Not mentioned in Trump's speech: imprisoned former Gov. Rod Blagojevich. It was nearly two months ago when Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that he was considering commuting Blagojevich's 14-year prison sentence. This week, Patti Blagojevich once again took to the media to advocate for her husband, writing an op-ed in the Washington Examiner and appearing on Fox News.The federal lawmakers on hand Thursday were among the Illinois Republicans who signed a letter last month asking Trump to leave Blagojevich's prison sentence intact, saying any clemency for the imprisoned former governor would \"set a detrimental precedent\" and damage efforts to combat public corruption.Outside the event, the Democratic Party of Illinois held a protest led by new executive director state Rep. Christian Mitchell of Chicago. The display included large, inflatable chickens with Trump-style hair, and it represented a more active and activist role the party is taking heading to November.Supporters, though, lined the streets leading to the steel mill, waving flags and holding signs that read \"Thank you Pres. Trump\" and \"Make Granite Great Again.\"And U.S. Steel CEO David Burritt said restarting production at the facility feels \"like a renaissance.\"\"We have a president that believes in you,\" Burritt told workers gathered in a steamy warehouse waiting for Trump's arrival. \"He is fighting for us, and we have a lot of hard work to do.\"The state's top business group was less enthusiastic. The Illinois Chamber of Commerce urged the president to \"consider not only the new steel jobs he celebrates today, but the potential job losses and jobs that never get created as a result of the tariff battle now underway with our trading partners.\"\"What is needed is a thorough and targeted strategy to remedy these trade problems and not a scattershot, seemingly random tariff policy that puts our agriculture and manufacturing economies at risk,\" Chamber President Todd Maisch said in a statement.Trump, though, sought to alleviate concerns that he was creating a trade war.\"We are not starting a trade war. We've been in a trade war for many years and we've lost for many years. But over the last year and a half, we are winning. We're back and we're winning and we are winning bigger than anyone understands,\" he said.He predicted strong gross domestic product growth when it is announced Friday, and he used the subject to launch into several frequent attacks on the media, particularly over his relations with Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin.\"If I would have used these (GDP) numbers during the campaign, the fake news back there would have said, 'he's exaggerating,' \" Trump said.And while celebrating the job growth in the steel industry, Trump urged patience and he sought to assuage the agriculture community and fears of lower commodity prices as a result of export tariffs.\"We will not let anybody bully our wonderful American farmers,\" he said. \"Our fortunes as a nation rise and fall together, and that is why we are going to stick together and win for our farmers and our factory workers, our steelworkers, here we are, all across this nation.\"In the crowd, worker Chris Brown, 62, said he was living in Florida before he began working in a maintenance position at the plant about three weeks ago. He said he was in favor of Trump's tough stance on trade with other countries because it was bringing back jobs in industries that have suffered for years.\"For somebody my age, it means a lot,\" Brown said. \"When I was getting out of high school there was a lot of industry like this, but it's all died out. I want to see it come back.\"Rick Pearson reported from Chicago.mcgarcia@chicagotribune.comrap30@aol.comTwitter @rap30___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "249"}
{"content": "Aug. 04--A Chicago police officer impaled an arm on a fence while chasing someone early Saturday morning in the West Side's East Garfield Park neighborhood, police said.The officer was involved in the foot pursuit about 2:40 a.m. when the arm injury occurred, according to police. While waiting for an ambulance to arrive, police took the officer to Stroger Hospital on their own. The officer was stabilized, police said.No further information was released Saturday morning. At the scene, civilians argued with police about what had happened in an alley just southwest of the intersection of Springfield and Chicago avenues, east of Harding Avenue.\"No one got shot,\" a sergeant repeated to the growing crowd. \"Why would I lie to you? No one got shot.\"More officers walked closer to the confrontation, finally getting the crowd out of the alley by expanding the crime scene.\"We can't have this,\" one officer said to another as they taped off the east end of the alley, at Springfield.Though police stretched red tape across Harding in between the alley and Chicago Avenue, other people largely ignored it, stepping over the line to stand in groups in the street.There were dozens of officers, but there were even more civilians. Water bottles and cigarettes sat on the roof of a black sedan with its hood up.After fruitlessly telling some of the people to mind the tape, an officer told one of the men to watch himself.\"No you watch it, man,\" he replied.\"You watch it.\"They went back and forth as the man walked away.___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "250"}
{"content": "Aug. 03--London Mayor Sadiq Khan got a water taxi tour of it. Famed architect Santiago Calatrava sipped coffee along it. And tech magnate Elon Musk strolled down it.When visiting dignitaries and corporate CEOs come to town, Mayor Rahm Emanuel takes many of them to the same place: Chicago's Riverwalk.Emanuel, though, brings them to the stretch between State Street and the Riverwalk's western end near Wolf Point -- the new sections with bars, cafes and fountains that the mayor built into the river a few years ago, thanks to a large federal loan. The older, quieter and more weathered stretch of the Riverwalk from State Street east to Lake Shore Drive doesn't get the same attention -- from the mayor, tourists or the downtown business crowd.So Emanuel is planning a $10 million facelift for the stretch that would include new landscaping, seating, play areas and walkways. The goal is to entirely revamp what he's dubbed Riverwalk East to better match the newer western segments.New gateways would welcome visitors on either side of Michigan Avenue, along the river's south bank. The walking path will be moved closer to the river. Public art would mask much of Lower Wacker Drive's underbelly. More trees would be planted. A glass elevator would be installed. New restaurants and bars would be built. And a new walkway under Wacker would connect the Riverwalk to the Lakeshore East neighborhood and Vista Tower, when what will be the city's third-tallest building is complete.In addition to the city money, four businesses on the eastern end are chipping in more than $2.3 million toward the Riverwalk redo in exchange for long-term leases along what quickly has become a top outdoor destination downtown.\"The Riverwalk has kind of almost a split personality. There's a before, and there's an after,\" Emanuel said in an interview. \"The whole goal: Two years from now, you won't think of it as two separate parts, and both will be inviting, and both will be good for the city.\"Emanuel rarely makes a public appearance without finding some way to mention the Riverwalk and its success as an attraction. Businesses such as City Winery and Tiny Tapp easily are exceeding original revenue projections, and scores of people also regularly visit the Riverwalk to relax, read a book, hold an impromptu meeting or eat their lunch.For the mayor, refurbishing the older stretch of Riverwalk is the latest phase in what has become an obsession of sorts.If he has a meeting or appearance nearby, Emanuel frequently walks along the Riverwalk back toward City Hall, making his police detail delay his return to the city SUV. He's been known to drop in on weekends for a drink. Some mayoral visits are followed by emails from Emanuel to top staffers, demanding faster garbage pickup or better signage to direct visitors to nearby businesses.The disconnect between the Riverwalk's new and old sections is the mayor's latest pet peeve for his pet project.\"If you said to any of your colleagues, 'I'll meet you at the Riverwalk,' this isn't where they would say,\" Emanuel said, turning to point to the older sections and its worn asphalt path.The mayor's decision to spend now on the Riverwalk, though, is sure to draw some criticism as Emanuel faces 10 challengers in his bid to win a third term in the February 2019 election. The race comes while the city struggles with ongoing violence, and his detractors regularly say he's not doing enough for the South and West sides' economically depressed neighborhoods.Seated along a grassy stretch of the Riverwalk as tour boats chugged by, Emanuel dismissed that type of criticism by rattling off a long list of the other projects he has funded.\"My view is these aren't either-or choices,\" Emanuel said, repeating his go-to response when he's asked about spending in one area and not another. \"I don't look at this cavalierly. We're also making investments in our parks, playgrounds, our schools, community colleges, mass-transit system, road paving, summer jobs program, mentoring ... Governing is to choose. I get that. And I think the Riverwalk has been a good investment for the city.\"City improvementsThe portions of the Riverwalk Emanuel wants to overhaul have a varied history.The long section between Lake Shore Drive and Michigan Avenue dates to the early 1970s, said Michelle Woods, the Riverwalk's project manager for the city. The piece between Michigan and State that includes the Vietnam War veterans memorial was completed in the mid-1990s under former Mayor Richard M. Daley, who had a vision of continuing the walkway west.Emanuel managed to make that happen in 2013, when he secured a $99 million interest-free loan from onetime Chicagoan and then-President Barack Obama's administration. The loan cleared the way for City Hall to embark on the expensive work of building the Riverwalk further into the Chicago River by altering the seawall and bringing the walkway down to the water's edge. The city will repay the federal government over 30 years with its share of proceeds from Riverwalk businesses.The Riverwalk's older section is more elevated at 12 to 15 feet above the water's surface. While Emanuel eventually would like portions of the eastern Riverwalk moved closer to the water, that's not planned in this project. With no heavy infrastructure changes, a lot of the city's work will focus on what Emanuel called \"cosmetic\" changes, while businesses will install upgraded facilities, including bathrooms.Starting near Lake Shore Drive, dozens of trees would be planted and a tiered seating area would be installed, according to renderings from the city's hired design firm Muller2. The walkway, which currently runs closer to Wacker Drive, will be brought to the seawall's edge, with mature trees planted near the roadway to muzzle some traffic noise.\"Right now, there's just some grassy areas but not really any defined public spaces, so you have just people sitting all over the grass and dirt,\" said Aaron Gershenzon, a co-owner of Urban Kayaks, which operates on that end of the Riverwalk. \"Having some designated areas where people can sit and have a nice time will be great.\"Farther west, a space is conceived for a monument recognizing submarines that were manufactured in Wisconsin after the attack on Pearl Harbor. The submarines passed through Lake Michigan and the Chicago River, down the Mississippi River, out to the Gulf of Mexico and eventually to the Pacific for use in World War II. A private group is working on raising money for a statue there, Reynolds said.Throughout, there will be \"beefed up\" landscaping, with some trees getting removed.\"A lot of the trees down there, they're green, but they're weeds,\" Reynolds said. \"And so, the way we're going to approach this is, if we can clean them up and save them, we will. Otherwise, we'll get rid of them and put in new so we can give it a much more cultivated look.\"Aaron Zacharias, one of the proprietors working to open The Northman Beer &amp; Cider Garden on the eastern stretch, said he hopes the city doesn't rip out too many trees and just uses a few modern design elements to tie both ends together.\"I really like the appeal of having more of a park area on the river. I think it was just lacking in having some basic infrastructure, which hindered the tenants' abilities to really expand and realize their visions,\" Zacharias said. \"I personally hope it retains its character where you can sit under the trees on the water, which is remarkable in a city with the size and density of Chicago. ... We don't want to sit on a parking lot. There is all the concrete you can dream of west of Michigan Avenue.\"Near Columbus Drive is a long stretch of beams as part of the Wacker Drive structure that also includes a city impound lot. Reynolds said the vision for that area is for the city's Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events to lure a corporate sponsor to pay for large art installations that would mask that portion of Wacker.The city plans two gateways on either side of Michigan Avenue, welcoming visitors and enticing them to venture down from upper Michigan Avenue and Wacker Drive, Reynolds said. One gateway is envisioned near where Mercury launches its boat tours through its First Lady Cruises fleet, just east of Michigan Avenue. Emanuel wants the other to span over the top of a large staircase that descends from the west side of Michigan Avenue to the Riverwalk.Between Michigan and State, the city plans to make the walkway more efficient, put in more mature landscaping and cut into a ramp leading down from Lower Wacker Drive to provide more walkway space. The city also would build a series of retail stands to feature restaurants from Chicago's various neighborhoods for three or six months at a time.Leveraging businessesWhile the city plans to spend $10 million for the upgrades, it's requiring nearby businesses to make significant investments to improve their sections of the Riverwalk.As part of the city's approval of the Vista Tower on the south side of Wacker Drive, the developers agreed to build a walkway that will connect the tower and the Lakeshore East development with the Riverwalk. The developers also are on the hook for building a glass elevator structure that would take pedestrians from upper Wacker Drive down to the Riverwalk, which currently has three handicap-accessible ramps but no elevators.Four businesses also have signed contracts with the city committing millions of dollars to spruce up the greenway's eastern end. They'll be on the hook for path improvements and new fencing along the seawall in addition to building restrooms and paying for water and sewer connections, among other improvements to help their businesses thrive.\"We're really trying to leverage our vendors. Within their footprints, it's clearly their responsibility and then we're filling in the gaps,\" said Reynolds, the facilities commissioner. \"So, yeah, $10 million is going to be skinny, but I think if we're creative, we can do it in a way that really stretches a buck.\"When the city built the new stretches of Riverwalk to the west, it had to build the space and persuade businesses to open on shorter-term deals. That includes Chicago Brewhouse, which opened near Wabash Avenue last month on a three-year deal.On the eastern side, the city is granting 10-year leases with the possibility of two additional five-year extensions. In exchange, it is asking the businesses to pay for public improvements to the path and its surroundings.To illustrate what he called the desirability of locating along the river, Emanuel said City Winery did $1 million in business for July alone, a new record for the Riverwalk. That type of upside, he said, is why the four businesses on the eastern end have agreed to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars each on public improvements.\"They're willing to invest that money, because this is now part of Chicago's cultural landscape,\" Emanuel said. \"This is not that risky of a business proposition as it was five years ago.\"On the end near Lake Shore Drive, Urban Kayaks has been open for business over the last eight years, gradually making improvements after a series of year-to-year leases and finally a three-year agreement with the city. The company just signed a new 10-year lease that will allow it to make longer-term investments while also building the Urban Kayaks Cantina, which will serve up tacos and margaritas to visitors.\"Having a constant power source, dedicated internet, running water, sewer lines, public restrooms -- all of that is such a game-changer for us,\" said Gershenzon, the Urban Kayaks co-owner. \"We're very excited about this, very eager for the process to start.\"As part of its lease, Urban Kayaks has agreed to spend $750,000 for Riverwalk improvements, separate from any upgrades it will make to its business and the construction of its restaurant, according to a city contract. That includes $375,000 to renovate the Riverwalk path, $75,000 to build the new railing, $150,000 in new utilities and $150,000 in landscaping, records show.The city's annual licensing fee for the kayak business will increase from $15,000 to $30,000 over the length of the deal, while the cantina will pay $50,000 by the end of the 10-year agreement. The city estimates the two Urban Kayak businesses eventually will produce more than $2 million per year in annual revenue, with the city taking a 10-percent cut of the restaurant business and a 7-percent cut of the kayak rental business by the end of the deal. If Urban Kayak signs on for the two five-year extensions, the city's cut increases to as high as 14 percent.City Hall has struck a similar deal with Island Party Hut, which operates a boat cruise, bar and restaurant on the eastern end. The restaurant plans to build a new, year-round glass structure with a roof that retracts and doors that slide all the way open, said Woods, the city project manager.In its contract, Island Party Hut has committed to spend more than $1 million in improvements for its Riverwalk section, including $250,000 on its dock wall. The improvements also include utilities, landscaping and costs associated with building a new kitchen, restaurant and public restrooms. By the end of the 10-year deal, the city estimates Island Party Hut will do more than $10 million per year in business with the city getting a 7-percent cut, increasing to 10 percent if an extension is signed, records show.The Northman, a North Center establishment that dubs itself Chicago's first cider bar, is opening up a spot on the Riverwalk's eastern end later this year. Under its 10-year deal, it will build a bar and restaurant, committing $600,000 in improvements, including landscaping, a children's play area and green screens and a mural to cover Lower Wacker Drive, according to the contract. The city estimates The Northman will do $3 million in gross revenue annually by year 10 and will collect 3 percent of revenues in the front half of the contract and 10 percent in the final five years, in addition to annual licensing fees.\"It had to be a 10-year deal. We couldn't have taken the risk on a three-year deal, and the city knew that and that's why the city offered it to entice people to put that type of capital investment,\" said Zacharias, The Northman owner. \"Remember, in 10 years, if we don't re-sign, this is all city property.\"Like Island Party Hut, Zacharias said The Northman also is looking at building a structure that could operate all year.The longest-running business on the eastern side of the Riverwalk is the 83-year-old boat tour business run by Mercury's First Lady Cruises. Mercury is planning to install new ticket windows clad in wood, new landscaping and large wooden bench seating that screens a portion of Wacker Drive. Mercury has agreed to make improvements to the Riverwalk as part of its current city contract, but the company and city officials are still negotiating the final amount.Mercury president Holly Agra said she didn't have the specifics on how much the company might spend, but said it looked forward to all the long-time riverside tenant's improvements along the river.\"We're in the process of planning the modernization of the appearance of our box office and operational facilities to bring them in step with the aesthetic of the newer sections of the Riverwalk,\" Agra said. \"We've been an anchor tenant with the city for so many years, and we're thrilled to see so many new vendors and activities that are bringing more people down to the Riverwalk.\"Future expansion?The book of renderings for the city's $10 million in Riverwalk improvements is labeled \"short-term improvements,\" which begs the question: What is the long-term plan?Emanuel acknowledged the city would like to build into the seawall and bring the walkway closer to the water east of Michigan Avenue. The mayor said that when he attended a recent meeting in Washington with federal transportation officials about high-speed rail to O'Hare International Airport, he raised the possibility of refinancing the city's existing loan or getting an extension to make that additional Riverwalk work possible.The mayor raised the issue at a time when he has continued to rail against Republican President Donald Trump on a wide range of issues including immigration and gun laws.\"I told them what was going on here, and then I offhandedly said, 'I don't imagine this administration doing a loan for this mayor,'\" Emanuel said, adding that the response he got was, \"Don't assume anything.\" So, the mayor said he has directed his aides to start tallying up estimates for more Riverwalk additions to present to the Trump administration.In the meantime, as Emanuel ramps up his re-election efforts, expect to hear him regularly tout the Riverwalk's progress and the planned improvements -- even if it may open him up to critiques on what he has or hasn't done outside of downtown.\"In 2011, I said we're going to make the river the next recreational park of the city,\" Emanuel said. \"And the truth is, on a lot of levels, it has totally surpassed -- in a quicker time -- anything I could have, or any of us, could have imagined.\"bruthhart@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "251"}
{"content": "Aug. 01--Is it me, or is being Kevin Durant not as much fun as it used to be?The Instagram feud with a high school boy.The contentious appearance on C.J. McCollum's podcast that spilled over into a Twitter squabble.The running insult-fest with Chris Paul's brother during Game 2 of the Western Conference finals.The 75 percent increase in technical fouls last season.There's a lot to like about Durant. His philanthropy. His game. His skills, and the way he applies them in a team context. And for good measure, his philanthropy.But is it me, or did Durant transition from utterly unflappable during his first season with the Warriors to slightly flappable in season 2?Fox Sports' Chris Broussard, speaking on First Things First on Wednesday morning seems to sense Durant evolving as well.\"He's a conflicted guy,\" Broussard said. \"There's a part of him that's religious. He has ministers come visit him and hang out with him during the season. Then there's a big part of him that's doing things that don't match up with his faith.\"\"And then on the court ... the guy we saw in Oklahoma City was not cursing all the time, was not being as aggressive in terms of arguing and maybe fighting with guys or getting technicals.\"It seems only fair that we hear from the man of the hour at some point. Here's how Durant replied to Broussard:This dovetails nicely with a comment he made to The Athletic last week: \"I know you think I'm sensitive. But I'm just somebody who is tired of holding (frustration) in.\"Durant went on to tell The Athletic that he doesn't understand why people have to parse and react to everything he says and does.We can help him with that one. Durant is a fascinating study, a 7-footer who can handle and bottom 30-footers. He's willing to get sweaty on defense. He's willing to get better.I remember watching a Warriors-Seattle Sonics game on TV in Durant's rookie year. The Sonics were a hot mess that season (they finished 20-62). Durant was the best player on that team the day he walked through the door for the first practice. Consequently, he got as many shots as he wanted.I remember Warriors TV analyst Jim Barnett saying something along the lines of, \"This kid is a big-time scorer, and that's OK for now. But if this team ever grows into a contender, he's going to have to play a more well-rounded game.\"People have been watching him grow for the past 11 years. The same as people intently watched Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Wilt Chamberlain, Mickey Mantle, Joe DiMaggio, Babe Ruth.Having your brain picked is part of the package. From the outside looking in, Durant seems to tolerate the noise as well as anyone can. And speaking of \"noise\":Same as it ever was.___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "252"}
{"content": "July 30--Here are three things we learned from the weekend's Cubs-Cardinals series -- in which the Cubs dropped two of three in St. Louis.1.

The Cardinals still lurkThe Cardinals could present a new-look pitching staff when they visit Wrigley Field for the final three games of the regular season.

{"content": "Aug. 01--While the excitement of the trade deadline bypassed the White Sox, they created a little of their own on the field, unfortunately the wrong kind.Tim Anderson, the shortstop of the present and the future, was pulled from a 4-2 loss to the Royals in the sixth inning Tuesday night after prompting a visible display of anger from manager Rick Renteria. He failed to run out of the batter's box on a low liner to third baseman Rosell Herrera and made an inning-ending out at first when umpire Lance Barksdale ruled Herrera trapped the ball rather than caught it.Renteria called it an atypical \"lapse\" from Anderson. But he thought he had to react when Anderson turned into a spectator at home plate.\"He got stuck at the plate,\" Renteria said. \"He hit the line drive (and) the call was not made as a catch. It was still alive. ... We tell these guys, don't assume anything. Just go until they ultimately make the call. We'll let the opposing team make the review call. It didn't look very good to have him standing at the plate and having the ball going around the diamond.\"This play was the most memorable moment on a night when James Shields' effort was spoiled by two-run home runs from the Royals' Ryan O'Hearn, who was making his big-league debut, and Brett Phillips, recently acquired from the Brewers in the Mike Moustakas trade.Trailing 2-0, the White Sox had runners on first and second with two outs in the sixth inning. They already had left eight runners on base when Anderson came up to face Danny Duffy.He drilled a shoetop-high liner at Herrera, who reacted slowly to Barksdale's safe call. Herrera threw to second base too late to force Omar Narvaez, who busted it to the bag, but Anderson never even started down the line. Second baseman Whit Merrifield took a few steps toward first and lobbed the ball there for the final out.\"I never thought I should have (run) because if I did I would have run,\" Anderson said. \"I saw him throw to second and I saw it go to first. I thought (Herrera) caught it. I didn't see the umpire signal safe but I learn from it, keep on going.\"Renteria couldn't believe his eyes. He waved his arms, then slammed his hand down on a railing before heading up the dugout tunnel. Anderson was lifted from the game.Replays clearly showed Herrera had caught the ball, so the Royals could have appealed if Anderson had been safe at first. But it was a moot point because Anderson posed like a statue throughout the entire sequence.Anderson said he was surprised Renteria pulled him from the game. But Renteria insisted it is the kind of play that a manager must police.\"I pulled Welington Castillo, I pulled Avisail Garcia, I pulled eveybody from spring training through the regular season,\" Renteria said. \"There are certain plays in which you can talk to the guys and keep them in the game and go over it. Certainly this wasn't done to embarrass Timmy but we do expect we're going to give it an effort on every play to the best of our ability.\"James Shields (4-13) pitched well but lost to Duffy (7-9) because he gave up a pair of two-run home runs. Those accounted for the only runs off him over seven innings. Matt Davidson hit a two-run homer in the seventh but the Sox couldn't overcome leaving 13 runners on base.While Shields wasn't traded before Tuesday's deadline for non-waiver trades, he's a candidate to clear waivers and become trade eligible once again.\"I only can control what I can control,\" Shields said. \"But I'm always focused. I thought my mechanics were really good. I had a few walks that cost me there today. But I'm just focused on pitching for this squad right now and doing my part.\"Phil Rogers is a freelance reporter for the Chicago Tribune.___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "255"}
{"content": "July 28--The needle on the Mitch-O-Meter has bounced wildly from one end of the spectrum to the other over the first seven practices of Bears training camp at Olivet Nazarene University.But as second-year quarterback Mitch Trubisky dives deeper into directing coach Matt Nagy's new offense, the Bears remain steady in their assessment that the mistakes and the triumphs are part of the process.\"As Coach Nagy likes to say, (we like to) test ourselves, see what throws we can make, test the defense and challenge them every day like they're challenging us,\" Trubisky said. \"You just have to find that balance and move on to the next play when there is a mistake.\"Trubisky was talking to the media Friday for the first time since camp began -- and after another couple of days of highs and lows.At one point Friday, Trubisky threw a bull's-eye to new wide receiver Allen Robinson between defensive backs Bryce Callahan and Eddie Jackson for a touchdown in a red-zone drill. Another moment, his pass was tipped near the line and Deiondre' Hall picked it off.On Thursday, he made a pretty pass to connect with leaping tight end Adam Shaheen for a touchdown, but he also threw a pair of interceptions to cornerback Prince Amukamara.Nagy and Trubisky are keeping perspective, especially given the \"tornado\" of information Nagy said he's throwing at his offensive players.After all, while the Bears may be six days away from their first exhibition game of the summer -- when they face the Ravens in the Hall of Fame Game in Canton, Ohio -- they are still 44 days away from the season opener against the Packers in Green Bay.\"I'm always mad when I throw an interception, but at the same time I don't care what anybody thinks,\" Trubisky said. \"I know what I have to do. I made a lot of great throws. I made some bad throws, and we're testing and we're getting better every day. As long as Coach Nagy is OK with it and he sees my growth and development just getting better every day, and my teammates know that my mind and my spirit is in the right spot, then we'll be just fine.\"Those mistakes are going to come as long as we learn from them. It's not a game, so it doesn't really matter what everybody thinks and what everybody sees. Hopefully (the fans) enjoy practice, but there's a lot going on that we just need to improve and get better at, and we're taking care of that.\"Some of the strides Trubisky makes are noticeable to the coaching staff and his teammates more than the crowd. For example, Nagy said Trubisky had three plays Friday where he made protection checks and route adjustments at the line of scrimmage.\"I told him out there, we're building this puzzle right now, and each day we're trying to take one piece of the puzzle and put it up there and then before you know it, at the end of this thing, you have that puzzle put together,\" Nagy said. \"(Friday) was a day where there were two or three pieces that he put together on that puzzle.\"Tight end Trey Burton has liked what he has seen from Trubisky in the huddle thus far.\"I've been extremely impressed how long our play calls are, and you haven't had to see us reset too many times because he's messed up the play call or anything like that,\" Burton said. \"I also feel he's the guy you can go up to and ask a question. He's the first guy down there congratulating you if you catch a tough ball or a bad throw, he's the first guy down there leading.\"Nagy said Trubisky's ability to bounce back after mistakes also has stood out to him, and Trubisky's band of mentors is helping him to avoid making the same error twice.The initial assessment might be a few words with backup quarterbacks Chase Daniel or Tyler Bray between plays on the field, but it's in the ensuing film session when Nagy, the quarterbacks, offensive coordinator Mark Helfrich and quarterbacks coach Dave Ragone dig in to correct the mistake.\"He's so competitive that he wants to be perfect on every single play,\" Nagy said. \"It's impossible. ... So that's my job, to make sure he understands you can't be perfect every single play and let's try to be as good as we can and then understand the whys.\"ckane@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "256"}
{"content": "July 25--Critics on Wednesday blasted a proposal circulated by Gov. Jerry Brown that could change the legal framework for determining whether utilities or their customers pay for future potential wildfire liabilities, calling the governor's plan a measure that would shield PG&amp;E from wildfire costs and create a bailout for a utility that's already a convicted felon.The governor this week proposed a plan that could dramatically ease the future potential wildfire-related financial burdens on large utilities such as PG&amp;E by potentially shoveling more costs onto ratepayers' shoulders. Proposals by the governor and two lawmakers have drawn intense scrutiny and skepticism in the wake of fatal infernos last October that scorched the North Bay Wine Country and adjacent region.\"PG&amp;E has a long history of causing wildfires, creating explosions and poisoning communities,\" Noreen Evans, a former state senator from Northern California, said Wednesday. \"PG&amp;E was on criminal probation at the time of the wildfires. I can't believe that the governor's plan is to let PG&amp;E off the hook and make ratepayers liable for the wildfires.\" Evans was in the state Legislature from 2004 to 2014.Fueled by optimism that wildfire-related political support for power companies could protect profits for PG&amp;E and other utilities in California, Wall Street traders sent PG&amp;E shares 1.2 percent higher Wednesday to close at $42.99.San Francisco-based PG&amp;E has stumbled in recent years with problems involving its equipment and maintenance efforts, some with lethal consequences.PG&amp;E was deemed to have caused a 2010 fatal gas explosion that killed eight people in San Bruno. In 2016, PG&amp;E was found guilty in a federal trial of felonies it committed before and after the San Bruno explosion, a decision that branded PG&amp;E as a convicted criminal.More recently, state fire investigators, in separate findings, determined that PG&amp;E bore a measure of responsibility in 16 of the infernos last fall. In addition, the Cal Fire investigators believe PG&amp;E broke the law in 11 of those instances.\"This ain't rocket science,\" said Ken Hale, a retired battalion chief with Cal Fire. \"Utility companies have known for decades what it takes to maintain a safe electrical grid and not cause fires. Trees need to be trimmed. Hazardous branches need to be removed. But utilities have decided it's more profitable to cut corners rather than to invest in the safety of the residents of this state.\"PG&amp;E, in an effort led by Chief Executive Officer Geisha Williams, is attempting to influence lawmakers to pass multiple bills to ease its financial exposure in case of wildfires.In presenting his proposal to key state lawmakers this week, however, Gov. Brown pointed out that his plan only seeks changes to determining liability for future wildfires. He wrote, \"Nothing in this proposal changes any liability for the 2017 wildfires.\"PG&amp;E spokeswoman Lynsey Paulo said this week, \"We look forward to reviewing the Governor's statement and the upcoming work of the joint conference committee.\" The company said Wednesday it was still studying the proposed legislation.Wednesday, the conference committee began to craft a plan to address potentially conflicting goals of forest management, the safety of residents and the utility liabilities and responsibilities. SB 901 will be the vehicle to steer solutions through the Legislature.\"My community will never be the same. People are dying,\" said Assemblyman Jim Wood, whose legislative district includes parts of Sonoma County and all of Del Norte, Trinity, Humboldt and Mendocino counties. \"My top priority is how will this legislation affect the survivors, not only in my district, but everyone affected by these wildfires.\"Gov. Brown's proposed legislation, however, would deliver a victory for PG&amp;E and other utilities by shifting to ratepayers the future cost burden of strict liabilities that power companies now face under a legal theory known as inverse condemnation. That legal approach currently holds utilities and shareholders liable if their equipment was a factor in causing a wildfire or other disaster, even if the utility properly conducted maintenance and facilities upgrades.\"The governor's proposal is a non-starter,\" Patrick McCallum, co-chair of Up From the Ashes, a coalition of North Bay wildfire victims, said Wednesday.Although the governor's plan won't erase PG&amp;E liability for past fires, a separate measure, AB 33, would use state-backed bonds to finance, up front, billions of dollars in costs for the wildfires so victims could be paid rapidly. PG&amp;E ratepayers would bankroll the bond repayment.The third bill, SB 1088, would allow PG&amp;E and other power giants to simply be \"substantially compliant\" with fire-safety plans, regarding equipment maintenance and vegetation clearance.PG&amp;E also has warned investors it faces bankruptcy if its liability is too severe.\"PG&amp;E threatening bankruptcy is nothing new,\" Mindy Spatt, a spokeswoman for The Utility Reform Network, a consumer group, told the conference committee. \"PG&amp;E always threatens bankruptcy every time they have to face their financial responsibilities.\"When confronted with massive penalties linked to the San Bruno disaster, PG&amp;E warned it could go under. Eventually state regulators imposed a $1.6 billion penalty for the gas explosion. Despite its warnings, PG&amp;E didn't go bankrupt.Now, the utility is blaming climate change as a factor in the North Bay fires and other blazes.\"PG&amp;E is using climate change as a bogeyman to scare lawmakers, clearly forgetting that climate change doesn't start a fire,\" Hill said. \"A spark ignites a fire. And so far, sparks produced by PG&amp;E are much of what caused the North Bay wildfires.\"___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "257"}
{"content": "Aug. 02--Uncertainty about how hard the White House may crack down on the controversial H-1B visa appears to be behind a drop in demand for foreign MBAs graduating from U.S. universities, said the head of the non-profit that runs business school admission tests.Fewer employers in the U.S. plan to hire international MBA graduates this year than last, according to the Graduate Management Admission Council, which runs the GMAT and conducts research into MBA-hiring trends. While 55 percent of U.S. companies last year said they planned to hire foreign MBA grads, only 47 percent said the same this year, according to the council's 2018 Corporate Recruiters Survey report, which is based on responses from more than 1,000 firms world-wide.\"This dip in stated intent by U.S. employers to hire international graduates is potentially a response to the changes -- or potential changes -- to visa and immigration regulations,\" said council CEO Sangeet Chowfla.\"Even though H1-B visa rules haven't yet changed, there is a perception that they might change in the near future, and some employers may be waiting to see what will happen. The jobs market in the U.S. right now is robust, and companies are constantly having to evaluate their prospects and how best to fill their available roles with strong talent.\"The H-1B visa, intended for highly skilled workers, has become a flashpoint in America's immigration debate, with tech companies lobbying heavily for an increase in visa numbers and critics pointing to reported abuses and arguing that H-1B holders take jobs from Americans.The administration of President Donald Trump has taken aim at the visa program. In January, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration backed away from a proposal to kick H-1B visa holders out of the country after six years. But the government has been laying a much heavier hand on the visa-granting process, denying more applications and more frequently demanding additional information from applicants.The council's findings fit with those of the MBA Career Services and Employer Alliance, which determined that 68 percent of schools noted a decline in hiring so far this year for foreign full-time MBA students compared to the same period last year.\"As a result, many schools are more actively promoting a global job search as well as creating connections with employers in students' home countries,\" said Jamie Belinne, board president for the alliance.Trump's crackdown on immigration also appears to have led to slower growth last year in the number of \"Optional Practical Training\" work permits, which are often used by foreign students and graduates as an alternative to the H-1B.___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "258"}
{"content": "July 30--From the moment Donald Trump was sworn into office, about 40 percent of Americans have stood steadfastly by the president's side.Some would say that's patriotism. Others might call it ignorance.Regardless of what drives their loyalty, Trump can count on this group of Americans to have his back no matter what.When the rest of us denounced Trump's inhumane policy of separating refugee children from their parents, that 40 percent praised his determination to do whatever is necessary to protect our borders.\"I voted for the man because of his stance on immigration,\" one Trump supporter wrote me. \"I want that wall built, and it doesn't bother me about the separation of children from their parents. We've been too soft on immigrants. We have to let them know that we mean business. Open borders will destroy our country.\"When Trump publicly sided with Vladimir Putin at the Helsinki summit and rejected the findings of U.S. intelligence agencies on Russia's election meddling, some of us thought he teetered toward treason. But that 40 percent turned on their TV sets and saw the president being strong yet diplomatic. They easily accepted Trump's explanation that he intended to say \"wouldn't\" when he said, \"I don't see any reason why it would be (Russia).\"One supporter dismissed it this way: \"Of course (Trump) knows they meddled, because our own CIA does the exact same thing. ALL. THE. TIME. But what we don't do is talk about it.\"Though the number might occasionally rise or fall by a few points, Trump's 40 percent approval rating is, for the most part, impenetrable. And while he has never been able to get the majority of the country on his side, his base is determined and vocal enough to keep establishment Republicans trembling with fear.Who are these people who see America and the rest of the world so drastically different from the rest of us? Do they truly believe that Trump is an economic and social policy genius who knows how to make America great? Or are they misguided misfits so afraid of the future that they are clinging desperately to the past?Those who have spent time studying these folks say they are all of the above. Perhaps that's true, but underneath their tough exterior, I believe many of them are driven by something much more basic -- anger.I will admit that I have no scientific and, some would argue, accurate information on which to base my opinion. What I do have, though, are emails -- dozens of them a day from Trump supporters across the country who happen to stumble upon my columns.If you are familiar with my writings, it goes without saying that Trump supporters despise me. They think that I am, above all, racist but also biased, hate-filled and stupid -- just to use a few of their terms.But this isn't about me. It's about my interpretation of them.They see politics under Trump as a war between \"us\" and \"them,\" a crusade against liberals who think they are smarter than everyone else and look down on anyone who disagrees with their self-imposed ideals of righteousness.Admit it, liberals, we do get an attitude the minute a Trump supporter opens his or her mouth. We come out, fists drawn.But for Trump's people, this is Custer's Last Stand, and he is their ferocious leader. They are determined not to go down without a good fight.\"I will stand by President Trump. He is this country's last hope,\" one reader emailed, explaining that Trump stands up for American-born citizens over others. \"He is really the only one to take on the problem of illegal immigration, the unfair trade polices, the unfair way we fund NATO. He is for me -- an American.\"Some Trump supporters think our country is no longer fair to white people. They cringe when African-Americans with a career, a good education and a comfortable lifestyle complain about white privilege. While some might think they deserve the best simply because they are white, others see themselves being trampled on by minorities and immigrants who use government handouts to get ahead much faster.Take this email, for example.\"You and people like you is what's wrong with this country. I am a white male that came from nothingness. I educated myself, no one gave me a handout; never really had anything until I worked for it. I am an American. Not a Mexican-American. Not African-American.\"They are as obsessed with Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton as Trump is. The president has convinced them that \"sour grapes\" is the main reason most people don't support him.\"You're a liberal Democrat that still thinks Hillary 'Benghazi' Clinton should have been elected in 2016,\" one man wrote. \"I give thanks every day that she lost for the second time. She should be in prison garb.\"And like Trump, they deplore the \"liberal\" media.\"You and your ilk started beating on President Trump the first day after the election because we were correct and you lost. Obama should have been voted out in 2012. He was worthless. In closing, I cannot wait to vote Republican in 2018 and 2020.\"Here are a few other tidbits. The woman they hate as much as Clinton is Rep. Maxine Waters, a California Democrat. They see her as the face of the Democratic Party.While some agree with Trump that black men mooch off society, they make exceptions for Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson and rapper Kanye West. Invoking their names proves they are not bigoted.Men, in particular, love First Lady Melania Trump. In their eyes, she's a helpless belle, and they'll go to any lengths to protect her honor.\"You are a jealous a---- and a fat, ugly one to boot,\" one man emailed me.Those kinds of crude remarks shouldn't concern us. But we should take notice when they say things like what this woman emailed:\"People who voted for Trump will NEVER stop believing in his strength, intelligence and goodness.

Even the majority of developers and supervisors at trillion-dollar valued Apple (63 percent), Facebook (51 percent) and Google (51 percent) say they can't buy the American Dream in the Bay Area.The survey suggests big compensation doesn't translate into buying a Bay Area home.

{"content": "I began my yoga journey much, much later than I should have. Entering my mid-forties with physical, mental, and emotional exhaustion, I was carrying around at least thirty extra pounds that were nearly impossible to lose. Juggling a career, kids, and a home was an enormous challenge. From the first morning coffee to a glass of red wine each night after dinner, stress management was goal number one, but it was fast becoming a losing battle. Something had to be done.One fateful fall afternoon, I had lunch with an old high school friend that I hadn\u2019t seen in years. Much to my shock and dismay, she walked into the restaurant looking like she\u2019d come straight off the pages of our high school yearbook. How could this \u201cdoll\u201d be so spry and full of life, so youthful, so trim and slim, while I sat on the other side of the table looking schleppy? She told me that she had \u201cfound yoga\u201d as a result of needing to manage a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis twenty years earlier. Through a combination of regular yoga and healthy diet, she had been able to manage her pain and her weight for years.     Before leaving the restaurant that day, she gave me a few resources to look at, and my journey began. Little did I know how much yoga was going to change my life as a result of that lunch date. I found relief from my back pain, the answer to those stubborn extra pounds, and peace of mind and a strength of resolve I didn\u2019t know existed.For those of you that are also struggling with \u201cmiddle-aging\u201d and pains that you can no longer ignore, I wanted to share with you some of the most effective postures that I\u2019ve come to know and love in my practice, and how they have revolutionized the way I approach my health and my life. I encourage you to try these as soon as possible; it is a matter of quality life or \u201cdeath\u201d while living.     Here are yoga moves that help with lower back pain:Supine twistTwisting the spine offers great tension relief while easing the muscles around the spinal column. Simply lie on your back, arms extended out perpendicular to your body, and bend your knees in toward your chest. Slowly lower both your knees to one side while keeping shoulder blades in contact with the floor. Stay in this position anywhere from 1 to 4 minutes, then switch sides. This position is great for reducing lower back pain.Sphinx poseThe sphinx is great for toning up the spine and stimulating the area of the back known as the sacral lumbar arch, which relieves lower back pain typically after one simple stretch. Sphinx pose promotes the natural curvature of the back, which is a very effective lower back pain treatment. Lie on your stomach and bring your elbows underneath your shoulders, pushing your upper body up off the ground. Extend the stretch as far as you can, then lower yourself back down to a supine position. Repeat two to three times, stretching a bit farther each time.Thread the needle poseIf our hips are tight, they will pull on the muscles across the lower back, resulting in extra lower back pain. Thread the needle pose promotes loose, fluid hips and hip flexers, which will ease up pressure on the lower back. Lie on your back and bring your knees into your chest. Cross one ankle over a bent knee, threading your hands through and grabbing the hamstring, bringing in toward you for a deep stretch. Uncross the ankle and switch legs, pulling the other leg across and threading your hands through to pull the other hamstring toward you. Get ready for some back pain relief!     Cat/Cow comboWith this simple movement, you will be stretching and decompressing the entire length of the spine. Kneel down on all fours. While you inhale, drop your belly toward the floor and lift your tailbone towards the ceiling, and while you exhale, arch your back like an angry cat, extending the spine outward fully. Continue this cycle of movements for 6 to 8 repetitions. This is an all-encompassing move that will relieve even the most stubborn lower back pain.Triangle poseTriangle pose is a fantastic strength building stretch for the torso, arms, legs, and back. Especially effective at targeting the muscles along your outer hip, it contributes to a strong and healthy lower lumbar region. Start in a standing position, feet wide and arms fully extended. Stretch your torso out to the side while fully extending your arm out to the side over your leg, reaching down to grab calf, ankle, or floor while your opposite arm goes to the ceiling. Hold this position with legs straight for as long as you can, breathing in slowly and exhaling fully as you stretch, strengthen and lengthen.Child\u2019s poseChild\u2019s pose is actually an active stretch that elongates the back while reducing stress and tension all along the spine. Starting on your hands and knees, bring your buttocks down and back so that they are resting on your heels, lowering your forehead to the ground while your arms remain stretched out in front of you. Hold this position for several minutes if possible to stretch tight and sore muscles.Downward dogThis is perhaps my favorite of all yoga poses. Down dog is an active relaxation pose, it reduces stress while at the same time working all large muscle groups in the body. From a hands and knees position, rise to an inverted V position, hands and feet pushing away from the ground. Your buttocks should be high in the air as you work to expand the area in between your shoulder blades and lengthen your hamstrings, which will aid in decompressing your lower back. Stay here as long as you like!While it may not seem an obvious answer to lower back pain, the fact that pigeon pose stretches out tight hips contributes to loosening out the lower back as well. Start in downward dog position and bring one leg in, bent so that your ankle lands on the floor near your groin area and your knee is facing outward. Your other leg should be stretched out behind you as you push your upper body away from the floor with arms extended. Feel the stretch in your outer hip and groin area for several minutes before switching sides.For me, finding an effective lower back pain treatment was essential to creating a quality life. I am healthier, happier, slimmer and trimmer than I have been in years, and I owe it all to my friend at that fateful fall luncheon who introduced me to the wonders of yoga. Give it a try\u2013it will change your life!", "id": "262"}

Coming back from an ACL tear suffered in Week 4 last season, Cook has already ditched the knee brace, practiced in full and looks every bit as explosive as he did last September.Despite all of this, there was some concern about whether or not Cook would be ready for the preseason opener at Denver on August 11. As head coach Mike Zimmer spoke to the media this morning, he made it clear that he\u2019s seen all that he needs to see to know that he\u2019s back.\u201cI\u2019ll probably see him in the preseason,\u201d Zimmer said. \u201cIt will depend on the situation and where we\u2019re at and things like that. We\u2019ve banged him pretty good the last few days so he\u2019ll get some reps.\u201dAfter learning that fans will likely see the Vikings running back in the preseason, Zimmer was asked if Cook will be ready for that first preseason contest against the Denver Broncos. The answer the coach gave was more than definitive.\u201cYes,\u201d Zimmer said. \u201cHe\u2019s ready now.\u201dLater in the media session, Cook took the podium and was asked what it would be like getting ready to take his first handoff in a game. With the same tenacity he used to shred opposing defenses last fall, the running back gave an honest answer to the reporters in attendance.\u201cI\u2019m going to be hyped as s\u2013t. I know that. I\u2019ll tell you that. You are always going to be nervous before a game. If anybody tells you different, it\u2019s a lie. You are going to be nervous, little jitters. Once you get it out of the way, it\u2019s time to go play some football. That is going to be the things with me. Once I get that out of the way, it\u2019s time to play football. A little nervousness is going to be there.\u201dDespite Cook\u2019s enthusiasm to get on the field next Saturday, its unsure how much work Cook will get during the team\u2019s full squad workout at TCO Performance Stadium tomorrow night. For now, it\u2019s clear that Cook isn\u2019t holding anything back anymore and is ready to get back on the field for the Minnesota Vikings.", "id": "263"}
{"content": "BEYOND HUMAN. Prosthetic limbs have come a long way in recent years. From primitive designs that were little more than useless placeholders for the real thing, we now have high-tech devices that wearers can control with their thoughts. These prostheses can help people with missing limbs feel \u201cwhole\u201d again. But in a new study, researchers set out to see if such devices could make humans more than whole.Specifically, a pair of researchers from the Advanced Telecommunications Research Institute in Japan wanted to know if giving someone a supernumerary robotic limb (SRL), a mind-controlled robotic limb that worked alongside the person\u2019s two biological ones, could give that person multitasking abilities beyond those of the average human.They published their research in the journal Science Robotics on July 25.TWO TASKS, THREE HANDS. For their study, the researchers asked 15 volunteers to sit in a chair with an SRL positioned as if it were a third arm coming from their own body. On the head of each volunteer, the researchers placed special cap that tracked the brain\u2019s electrical activity. The cap transmitted that data to a computer that then translated it into movement in the SRL.The result: all a volunteer had to do to control the SRL was think about an action.Next, they asked the volunteers to complete two tasks. To accomplish one \u2014 balancing a ball on a board \u2014 they used their natural limbs. For the other (grasping and releasing a bottle), they used the SRL system. The researchers asked the volunteers to complete the tasks sometimes separately, sometimes simultaneously.In 20 trials, the volunteers successfully completed both tasks using the three limbs about 75 percent of the time. In other words, they were able to complete two tasks simultaneously that would have been essentially impossible with just two limbs.TRAINING THE BRAIN. When you think you\u2019re \u201cmultitasking,\u201d you aren\u2019t actually paying attention to two things at once \u2014 your brain just switches rapidly between the two tasks. Past SRL systems required the user to concentrate on just the task at fake hand \u2014 this system is the first that could \u201cread\u201d a multitasking mind, sifting out the user\u2019s intentions for the SRL. It can do this simply because it\u2019s more advanced than previous versions.The researchers even believe their system could essentially help humans become better at multitasking even when they don\u2019t have a third limb helping out. \u201cBy operating this brain-machine interface, we have an idea that we may be able to train the brain itself,\u201d researcher Shuichi Nishio told The Verge.Future research will endeavor to figure out whether that\u2019s true or not. If it is, we might be able to enhance our minds by temporarily enhancing our bodies.", "id": "264"}
{"content": "So far it has been a \"meh\" year for investors. We did see a bit of volatility in the first half with the market peaking in January, a good, old-fashioned correction of at least 10%, and some scratching and clawing to get back to par. My thought is it will take the market most of the summer to figure it out, but figure it out it will. Personally, I think all this hand-wringing about tariffs and trade wars is missing the forest because of the trees. What the real underlying issue is, will rising interest rates and the Fed removing liquidity from the system hurt the economy long-term? The trade and tariff thing are short-term and will soon be resolved and forgotten.  Liquidity and the access to capital are the straws that stir the drink, however, and have a real impact on earnings and subsequently dividends, which we all know are what drives stock prices. It remains to be seen what the second half of the year will bring, but my thought remains the market will end the year in the black. I don't think it will be a barnburner by any stretch of the imagination, but something okay, perhaps in the 6% to 8% range. So far, Weyco Group (WEYS)  is the clear first-half winner. That TJX Companies  (TJX)  is having an excellent year is not really news, they are after all the best at what they do. Then we have those that confound me, like Franklin Resources (BEN) , which is practically printing money as their economic internals are off the charts. Lastly is the head-scratcher of all time, Philip Morris International  (PM) . This is pretty simple: A lot of people like the effects of nicotine. Tobacco is the cheapest and most widely available nicotine delivery system. There is no worldwide health craze emerging where tobacco will go the way of the dodo bird. Any analyst that tells you otherwise has been smoking something besides tobacco.  Accordingly, Phillip Morris and Franklin Resources are clearly double down stocks, and IBM (IBM)  is a gift waiting to be discovered. If I were constructing the Lucky 13 today I would definitely add 3M company (MMM) , AbbVie Inc. (ABBV) , and Cummins Inc.  (CMI) . If I could get Air Products &amp; Chemicals (APD)  at $147 or lower, Johnson &amp; Johnson  (JNJ)  at $113 or lower, and American Express  (AXP)  at $86 or lower I would be all over it.

{"content": "July 31--Former journalist, documentarian and now Democratic congressional candidate Leslie Cockburn has pulled out all the stops in her race against Virginia Republican opponent Denver Riggleman.Actually, she's pulled out one very large stop: Bigfoot's sex lifeIn a political attack that has observers across the country and on both sides of the aisle scratching their heads, the San Mateo-born Cockburn has accused Riggleman of being unfit for office because he is a \"devotee of Bigfoot erotica.\"We'll give you a moment for that to sink in . . .Cockburn, who along with her husband has produced award-winning if controversial documentaries such as one that suggested the CIA was in the drug-trafficking business, said on Twitter that Riggleman fetishizes the mythical ape-like giant.\"This is not what we need on Capitol Hill,\" Cockburn said in a tweet. Her posts included pictures from Riggleman's Instagram account showing nude drawings of Bigfoot with his -- assuming that the made-up creature is male -- genitalia covered with a black rectangle.\"These images are very disturbing, I think everyone should just look at them to see who this candidate is,\" Cockburn said in an interview with the Associated Press, presumably with a straight face.Riggleman dismissed the allegation that he's into Sasquatch's sex life, even though the Air Force veteran has admitted that he and his military buddies have long had an interest in Bigfoot believers; Riggleman is listed as a co-author of a short online book detailing a Bigfoot hunt in 2006, though he says the drawings on his Instagram account are jokes. Oh yeah -- he's also writing a satirical book called \"The Mating Habits of Bigfoot and Why Women Want Him,\" so perhaps Cockburn could be forgiven for misinterpreting her opponent's obsession with the Sexy Hairy One.As the bizarre back-and-forth continues between the candidates, the rest of the world is weighing in with their own observations, via Twitter, on the brouhaha now consuming the contest to decide the next representative for Virginia's 5th Congressional District, which stretches from northern Virginia to the North Carolina border.___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "266"}
{"content": "New lenses have arrived on Snapchat, and they\u2019re a little different than the current ones available. Unlike others, they\u2019re capable of recognizing speech, and they display different animations upon hearing certain triggers. ( Tero Vesalainen | Pixabay )Snapchat is continuously trying to innovate its lenses, this time by making them a tad bit more interactive. The company has just launched a bunch of new ones that can display different effects when talked to.Among the new lenses are ones that will ask users to say \"Hi\" or \"Love\" or \"Wow,\" after which they will trigger certain animations. Another lens displays a little cat paw gesturing the okay symbol when the user says, \"Okay.\" There's also one that automatically launches a zooming effect when the user says, \"Yes.\"This isn't the fire time Snap Inc. has released lenses that incorporate audio in some fashion, but these new lenses are actually the first to recognize speech and promptly respond to them.Snapchat Outs New Lenses With Speech Recognition AbilitiesThe company plans to make around five to six different lenses available to all users within the next week. They're poised to appear periodically in the lens carousel along with the others starting Wednesday, Aug. 1. They will work just like any regular lens, but Snap Inc. says it will display instructions to guide users along the way.Weird, unique, and fun lenses have always been one of the core elements of Snapchat and a huge part of what makes it stand out among the social media landscape. It has continuously launched lenses with useful functions too such as Word Lenses that add augmented reality elements to any given scene, selfie-based games, and lenses that let users manipulate the world around them. Rumor has it that Snap Inc. is working with Amazon to create a feature called Visual Search, which will apparently be able to recognize products and then bring up their Amazon listings.The Future Of Snapchat LensesFor Snap Inc., lenses are crucial to its business because they help maintain Snapchat's core identity even as other major companies \u2014 cough, Facebook, cough \u2014 try to clone it. They also keep users engaged, and could potentially be a platform for advertisers and broadcasters down the line, as TechCrunch notes.As it stands, Snap Inc. is bleeding money. It has noted in the past that it will focus on keeping its user base loyal to Snapchat instead of aggressively chasing after new ones \u2014 in other words, quality over quantity. Creating unique lenses is one such way of convincing current Snapchat users to keep on opening the app and sharing content, but the company has to do more than that if it intends to topple Facebook.", "id": "267"}

{"content": "July 26--SANTA CLARA -- Coach Kyle Shanahan and general manager John Lynch spent 30 minutes Wednesday fielding questions from the media, then for the next hour the 49ers offered up Jimmy Garoppolo, Richard Sherman, Joe Staley and DeForest Buckner. Here are the top three highlights:1. The Sherman Plan:1. The Sherman Plan: Sherman is cleared to come back from Achilles repair, and the 49ers plan to practice him back-to-back days and then let him recover the next day. Sherman said he is 100 percent, adding: \"I never had any doubt. ... It's one of those things you allow yourself to really see what you're made of when you go through things like this, and I appreciated the journey.\"Sherman reportedly had a $2 million bonus kick in by being medically cleared for camp. He credited not only the 49ers training staff for his rehabilitation but also former Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant, who also overcame an Achilles tear and gave Sherman pointers on how to get a jump on the healing process.\"We trust what he thinks and how he works,\" Shanahan said. \"A lot of it is up to Richard. If he's being too aggressive, it's our job to pull him back.\"Sherman eased into workouts in June as the offseason program drew to a close, when the Seattle Seahawks castoff was restricted to individual position drills.\"He's one of the most intelligent football players I've ever been around, the way he understands concepts and offense,\" general manager John Lynch said. \"He hasn't been on the field much but he's already had a huge impact on the guys around him.\"Added Jimmy Garoppolo: \"He's a very smart, savvy football player. He was here all summer so we got time to talk to each other. Just a great mind to get into.\"2. Offseason headliners: Jimmy Garoppolo and Reuben Foster made the most waves this offseason, and both received votes of confidence from Shanahan in how they comported themselves.As for how Garoppolo is handling his fame -- see: last week's TMZ report of him dating an adult-film actress -- Shanahan blushed and downplayed the matter.\"I've never in my life commented on a player's date in July, so I won't start today. Because I don't think it really matters to us,\" Shanahan said. \"But it is a good example that sometimes you have to learn how under the microscope we all are. It's not just the quarterback; it's all players. The quarterback definitely gets more than anyone else. But it's a good learning experience for him.\"Said Garoppolo: \"Life is different now. My life off the field, I've never been very public with things. Even social media, I'm not out there a ton. But my life's looked at differently. I'm under a microscope and, like Kyle said, it's a good learning experience. You just have to take it in stride. It is what it is.\"Sherman slid in a joke about Garoppolo's social life when asked what they've talked about as teammates. Said Sherman: \"We talk about a lot: the strength and weaknesses of certain defenses, passes that he likes, people he likes to take on dates. (Laughs). No, we just talk ball and got to know each other better.\"In Foster's case, his career was in peril until a San Jose judge in April dismissed domestic-violence charges against him, following testimony from his accuser that she fabricated her claim.\"He's done a great job just handling it,\" Shanahan said. \"What they originally charged him with is as bad as a thing you can imagine. That would mess a lot of people up. I was very impressed how Reuben handled it, and after it got dropped, how he handled himself since.\"Foster has not spoken to the media since his offseason arrests, which resulted in a two-games suspension.3. Malcolm Smith among injured: Within the last week, linebacker Malcolm Smith sustained an unspecified leg injury and will start camp on the non-football injury list, Lynch announced. Smith missed all of last season after tearing a pectoral muscle a week into training camp.\"Something popped up,\" Lynch said. \"We're not concerned about it. We've looked into it. Prudent thing is to give him a couple days at the start to make sure he feels good.\"Three players will start on the physically-unable-to-perform list: guard Jonathan Cooper (knee), wide receiver Trent Taylor (back) and outside llinebacker Dakoda Watson (calf). None of the injuries appear major and it sounds as if all three could be activated within the first week. By starting camp on PUP, they can't practice until medically cleared and could miss the first six weeks of the season if they are still on PUP come Week 1:Also on the NFI list are two draft picks: safety Marcell Harris (Achilles) and defensive tackle Kentavius Street (knee), the latter of whom will be out all his rookie year.* * *Extra points:-- Guard J.P. Flynn, a favorite among many veterans while he spent last season on injured reserve, re-signed on a two-year deal. Defensive linemen WillSutton and Cedric Thornton also were signed. Waived were safety Don Jones, offensive lineman Jamar McGloster and defensive lineman Blaine Woodson.-- Lynch doesn't sound like he's actively shopping for a veteran wide receiver in free agency (see: Dez Bryant) or via trade (see: Julio Jones), stating: \"We're always looking and trying to improve our team. But we've been steadfast in that we like our receiving corps. We like having Pierre back and working with Marquise, Trent, Kendrick, Dante.\"-- All players were due to report Wednesday for training camp, ahead of a 1:30 p.m. conditioning drill and 6:30 p.m. team meeting. The first 20 days of which will be held in Santa Clara before it wraps with two days of joint practices in Houston ahead of an Aug. 18 exhibition against the Texans.-- Wide receiver Dante Pettis, a second-round pick, is expected to sign Wednesday, Lynch said. All other 49ers draft picks are under contract.-- Sherman, who is on the NFL Players Association board, said they had a conversation Tuesday with NFL officials about the league's national anthem policy leaving potential discipline up to individual teams. \"We've started to get suggestions from players and the league has been very open to hearing those suggestions and been amicable to potentially making adjustments to that policy,\" Sherman said.-- Left tackle Joe Staley, on entering his 12th camp: \"No one in that locker room is saying we've arrived. We know we have a ton of work to do. We were a 6-10 football team last year. We were pleased how we finished but that's in the past.\"-- Right guard and punter are two starting spots up in the air, Shanahan confirmed. Whereas Joshua Garnett and Mike Person will eventually battle Cooper at right guard, the punter competition is a bit of a surprise, as incumbent Bradley Pinion must stave off Jeff Locke, who's apparently more than just a left-footed camp leg.-- DeForest Buckner declined to disclose his sack-total goal, after producing three last season (seven short of his goal). \"We're striving for the feeling we had at the end of last year,\" Buckner said. \"It's always a great feeling when you win. We had a taste of it last year and we want it again.\"-- One factor that led to left guard Laken Tomlinson's recent contract extension was the need to counter the Los Angeles Rams inside tandem of Aaron Donald and Ndamukong Suh, Lynch said..___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "269"}
{"content": "Just how much drinking can actually affect dementia risk? A new study says drinking too much or too little booze can both raise dementia risks. ( Pixabay )Results of a new study show that both heavy drinking and abstinence from drinking increases the risk of dementia. Experts urge the public to treat the findings with caution. Alcohol And Dementia RiskDementia remains to be one of the diseases that scientists and researchers are still trying to understand. When it comes to the factors that may increase or decrease dementia risk, there is still no common contention as to what really affect a person\u2019s risks and how it does so.Particularly when it comes to alcohol, some researches show how drinking a little wine can help prevent Alzheimer\u2019s disease whereas others found how even moderate drinking can lead to brain damage that can lead to dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease.Not Too Much And Not Enough?According to a new study published in The BMJ, the safe zone may be somewhere in between as their findings revealed that both abstinence and heavy drinking increases the risk for dementia. For their study, researchers examined over 9,000 participants between the ages of 35 and 55 at the beginning of the study, and followed them for the next 23 years.Researchers regularly assessed the participants\u2019 alcohol consumption and potential dependence using a questionnaire and records of alcohol-related hospital admissions, and also monitored hospital records for possible dementia, heart disease, or diabetes diagnoses. Of the participants, 397 developed dementia.Evidently, the data revealed that those who abstained from drinking alcohol in midlife, as well as those who drank alcohol heavily had higher risks for dementia compared to those who drank moderately. Further, those who decreased alcohol consumption with age were also found to be more at risk of dementia.Alcohol Consumption ThresholdThat said, researchers state that the results of their study should not motivate non-drinkers to start drinking, for there are still many possible detrimental health effects of alcohol consumption such as cirrhosis, cancer, and neuropsychiatric disorders.What they do encourage is the lowering of alcohol consumption thresholds so as to set a limit on the amount of alcohol consumption considered as \u201cheavy drinking,\u201d thereby promoting cognitive health.\u201cGiven the number of people living with dementia is expected to triple by 20503 and the absence of a cure, prevention is key,\u201d researchers note.In an editorial reaction to the study, several experts urge the public to be careful of their interpretation of the results, and stressed the significance of alcohol consumption levels in the efforts to understand and reduce dementia risks. They also highlight the importance of safe alcohol consumption levels when it comes to overall health and lifestyle.\u201cWe know that a healthy lifestyle, including cutting down on too much alcohol, can improve health and reduce dementia risk, and a good motto tends to be, what is good for your heart is good for your brain,\u201d said Dr. Sara Imariso, the head of research at Alzheimer\u2019s Research UK.", "id": "270"}

Deep Space is a gloriously fruity-bitter-boozy hop bomb that's impossibly easy to drink. It's the rare Half Acre IPA featuring darker malt in the mash, which leads to a sweeter, bready character, thicker mouthfeel and a darker hue amid the flood of juicy hops.In the can: Dank sticky fruit -- mango, apricot, papaya -- leap out in the aroma (which deserves a hearty appreciation before the first sip), tempered by notes of pine, caramel and a touch of bread pudding. Deep Space offers robust fruitiness -- the same mango, apricot and papaya with a touch of grapefruit rind -- in a viscous body (there's the malt at work) and tempered by a lingering earthy, bitter finish. Deep Space is bold, balanced and beautiful.Alcohol: 10 percentFind it: Available on tap and in 16-ounce cans at both Half Acre taprooms (4257 N. Lincoln Ave. and 2050 W.

{"content": "July 31--The authority that oversees the region's transit agencies is trying a new approach in its effort to sound the alarm for more government funding for new trains, buses, stations and other transit infrastructure.The Regional Transit Authority has produced a $35,000, five-minute video, with toy wooden trains and a little comedy, to ask for the billions of dollars needed to get the transit system in a state of good repair.The video, which can be seen here, was first aired Tuesday at a discussion on the region's transit future at the Metropolitan Planning Council, a policy research group.The goal of the video is to make the case in an accessible, easy-to-understand way that the CTA, Metra and Pace need a sustainable source of funding, or they are going to continue to fall apart, which will hurt the region's economy, RTA officials said. The state has been without a capital plan to pay for major infrastructure improvements since 2009. The authority has tried making its case in Springfield, at community forums and in multipage, detailed reports.RTA executive director Leanne Redden acknowledged that the average person is not going to wade through the RTA's five-year regional plan, \"so it's good to have something that's a little more palatable across the region.\" Redden, who spoke at the forum, said the video \"succinctly makes the case.\"The video, which shows riders talking about how much they depend on trains and buses to get to work, and uses visual jokes like a shiny new toy bus being opened up like a Christmas present, was made by RTA spokeswoman Susan Massel and former Chicago newscaster Mary Ann Childers.\"We are hoping to reach riders and nonriders with this video,\" said Massel. \"We can't just assume our system is going to be here without making these critical investments. We have to make transit a priority.\"The video is being shared on the RTA's web site and on social media networks, including YouTube.The RTA says that $30 billion of priority transit projects are not fully funded in the region, including CTA projects like new buses, trains and rail-line improvements, new Metra locomotives, bridges and track, and new Pace buses and facilities. The authority said that capital investment for transit should increase by $2 billion to $3 billion annually.mwisniewski@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "273"}
{"content": "July 30--Another Earthquakes player from the past is gone.Central midfielder Fatai Alashe has been traded to expansion FC Cincinnati for $1350,000 in allocation money that can be used next year, the Quakes announced Monday.Alashe, 24, has been loaned to Cincinnati, which won't join Major League Soccer until 2019, for the rest of the season. That means the former No. 4 overall draft pick will play in the second-division United Soccer League for the remainder of the year.Alashe made 85 appearances and had five goals and three assists in 3 1/2 years in San Jose. He will be remembered for scoring the first goal at Avaya Stadium, which opened in 2015.But Alashe's final appearance July 7 at Portland also will be remembered. The player entered the game as a substitute with four minutes left in the first half. Then he was replaced just before the second half began although he had gone back onto the field unaware a change was happening. As Alashe departed he got into a heated sideline argument with coach Mikael Stahre.The Quakes said Alashe had suffered a hamstring muscle strain, prompting the sudden change. Since then, the midfielder from Michigan State did not play with the Earthquakes (2-12-7, 13 points), who have MLS' worst record.Alashe became expendable with Florian Jungwirth of Germany moving into the central midfield this season, as well as the rise of rookie Luis Felipe and second-year player Jackson Yueill.The Quakes have only seven players left from the era before general manager Jesse Fioranelli was hired in 2017 to reshape the team's soccer operations from the youth academy to the senior roster.Already gone were Leandro Barrera, Victor Bernardez, David Bingham, Darwin Ceren, Cordell Cato, Kip Colvey, Simon Dawkins, Andres Imperiali, Lino Mfeka, Marc Pelosi, Kofi Sarkodie, Matheus Silva and Marvell Wynne.Those left are Quincy Amarikwa, Anibal Godoy, Nick Lima, Shea Salinas, Andrew Tarbell, Tommy Thompson and Chris Wondolowski.San Jose will receive $60,000 in targeted allocation money and $75,000 in general allocation money in 2019 in the Alashe trade. It also will receive future considerations if Alashe reaches specific statistical benchmarks next season.___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "274"}
{"content": "Tariffs are a good-news bad-news story. Tariffs can help off-price retailers, such as TJX Cos. (TJX) , Ross Stores Inc. (ROST) , Burlington Stores Inc. (BURL) , and the dollar stores, Dollar Tree Inc. (DLTR) and Dollar General  Corp. (DG)   and hurt full-price retailers like Nordstrom Inc. (JWN) , Macy's Inc. (M) and Target Corp. (TGT)  . Nordstrom is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS member club. Want to be alerted before Jim Cramer buys or sells JWN? Learn more now. At least, that's according to Ron Friedman, a partner at Marcum LLP, an accounting firm, and a long-time consultant for clothing manufacturers, who spoke with TheStreet on Monday, July 30. Friedman believes with the current upbeat economy shoppers are heading to full-price retailers rather than discounters such as TJX, the industry leader, or Ross Stores, because they have more money to spend.  \"The economy is good. People are going out to restaurants, clubs, movies and they're shopping at the Nordstrom's and Macys of the world,\" said Friedman. If tariffs kick in and retailers need to pass them on to consumers, he said, it may send them into the arms of off-price retailers for bargains. However, analyst Simeon A. Siegel, of Nomura Instinet Equity Research, told TheStreet on Monday, \"That [any exodus to cheaper stores] will last about a week, before full-price retailers start discounting.\" He takes a long view of tariffs in that they are one of the many elements, like the costs of labor, cotton and other materials, and freight, that retailers and manufacturers must circumvent to make their operations more efficient. As for what determines whether consumers face higher prices, he said, generally depends on the pricing power of retailers and manufacturers. John Gold, vice president, supply chain and customs policy of the National Retail Federation, said all retailers and customers will feel the pinch from higher prices if tariffs, which so far have sidestepped broad categories of clothing and footwear, are put in place. \"As the President further escalates tariffs against China\" he added, \"those categories will most certainly be on the list and subject to a tariff.\" As for the off-price retailers, Siegel thinks off-price retailers have nothing to fear because their business is up and will continue. Year to date, TJX is up 26%, and Ross, up 7.6%.", "id": "275"}

Even at this stage in their careers, this is a must-see showdown.Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson\u2019s careers have been intertwined for decades. However, when the stakes were the highest, they never quite got together for the type of match that can only be made on Sunday at a major championship.While they\u2019re both pressing on and competing in their 40s, don\u2019t think that competitive fire is out just yet. After some start-and-stop negotiations were revealed in July, we appear to have both a date and location of the potential $10 million round.Sources told ESPN\u2019s Mike Greenberg that the match will take place on either November 23rd or 24th, the Friday and Saturday immediately after Thanksgiving. The host course will be Shadow Creek in Las Vegas.When news broke that this event was even in discussion last month, it instantly became one of the must-see sporting events of the year. Tiger Woods is 42, and Phil Mickelson is 48, but they\u2019re inarguably the two biggest golf stars of the 21st century so far.While the sheer volume of victories (and majors) the two have amassed is naturally slowing down, they may easily one day be looked at as this generation\u2019s Arnie and Jack. The story is like something out of a movie: a rivalry created as much by the viewing public as each other, mellowing into the friendship of two stars who were never really that different, after all.Oh, yeah, and the money. The two have traded plenty of friendly barbs over the sum of money that will be put up, but they\u2019re also well aware that hey, $10 million bucks is still a big number, even for two men who barely blink at anything smaller.\u201cIt\u2019s a ridiculous amount of money,\u201d Mickelson told Golf.com\u2019s Alan Shipnuck last month. \u201cNo matter how much money you have, this amount will take both of us out of our comfort zone.\u201dMeanwhile, both players have plenty left on their plates between now and the holiday season.

It's just, 'You're not alone. You are not alone.'\"The Auditorium Theatre has been hosting Hearts to Art campers for 14 years. Camp is split into two sessions: one for 7-10 year olds, one for 11-14 year olds. At the end of the first week, campers perform a talent show filled with the hobbies and pursuits they brought to camp. At the end of the second week, they perform a final production showcasing what they learned at camp -- music, theater, dance. Because it's heavily subsidized by arts foundations and private donors, most campers pay $50 or less for the two weeks.\"I don't even think of this place as camp,\" Konyae White, 14, told me. \"It's a place where people who can relate to each other talk and have fun and say and feel however they want. You get to think for yourself and think outside the box and use your imagination. Honestly, I never want to leave.\"White was 7 years old when his dad had a severe heart attack and died.\"When I lost my dad, it was like part of me left for a long time,\" White said. \"When I came here, that part of me returned.\"The kids have lost parents in every way imaginable, Illiatovitch-Goldman said. Homicide, suicide, disease, car accidents. Some were infants when their parent died. Some arrive at camp just a few weeks after their loss.The Auditorium Theatre partners with licensed clinical social workers from Loyola University for healing sessions throughout the camp. Clinicians also meet with the campers' caretakers to offer resources for trauma recovery.\"We have three promises -- not rules, promises,\" Illiatovitch-Goldman said. \"Be respectful, be safe and participate. They all sign a promise sheet, and that's kind of our guiding light. Anything else is up to them -- you can be happy, you can be sad, you can be wherever you are that day.\"Some campers, she said, arrive with a fully realized love for the performing arts. Some have never stepped foot on a stage.\"I'm not worried about the final performance being good by the standards of other performing arts camps,\" she said. \"It's about the performance being powerful by the standards of the campers offering something of themselves and just going one step beyond what they came in here with. It's an opportunity for them to heal and grow through the power of opening themselves up and trying something new and experiencing that connectivity and community and expression that come through the arts.\"Cathy Nelson, 14, wanted nothing to do with it when her mom first proposed the camp. She and her twin sister, Teresa, lost their dad to heart disease when they were 12.\"I thought it was going to be a drag,\" Cathy Nelson said. \"I thought it was going to be two weeks of nonstop talking about your loss. That sounded really depressing.\"\"When I first got here, I was really confused why everyone would be so happy at a camp about your loss,\" Teresa Nelson said. \"Then I started to make friends, and I realized why they're all so happy.\"Hearts to Art arranges reunions for the campers throughout the year. Typically they meet for a pizza party and a performance; last year they watched the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater. They also stay connected through Snapchat.\"Kids are very comfortable bouncing from thing to thing that they're feeling,\" Illiatovitch-Goldman said. \"They'll throw out, 'My dad got shot in the head. Do you want some chocolate milk?' They don't always sit with their grief the way adults tend to do.\"Camp, she hopes, is a place where they feel unconditionally seen and understood.\"My dad died when I was 12, so I knew him not just as my dad but as kind of a friend,\" Cathy Nelson said. \"He was part of my identity, and I talk about his death kind of casually, like multiple times of day, as kind of a coping mechanism. I don't think my friends here are weirded out about it.\"\"It's like family,\" White said. \"Old campers and new campers, they all feel like my family.\"Which is maybe one of the greatest gifts the camp can offer -- the knowledge that family isn't defined by blood or marriage or history. It's defined by love, an infinitely renewable resource.\"There's a real kindness among them,\" Illiatovitch-Goldman said. \"Love and kindness and acceptance that are unparalleled.\"It takes a whole lot of courage to create those out of loss. I watched 41 kids do it masterfully.hstevens@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "277"}
{"content": "Colonization of the moon has been a long-time dream of science-fiction writers but, if it ever actually happens, we may turn out to not be the first life-forms to live there. At least, that is the theory laid out by researchers from Washington State University and the United Kingdom\u2019s University of London. In a recently published paper, they make the case that, at some point in history, the moon\u2019s atmospheric conditions were such that it could have been possible for life to, well, live.\u201cBased on [findings concerning] water being present in lunar rocks and magma, including the likely presence of a magnetic field, we [arrived] at the picture of an early moon \u2014 3.5 billion years ago \u2014 which was a temporarily habitable planetary body with a significant atmosphere and liquid pools of water on its surface,\u201d Dirk Schulze-Makuch, an astrobiologist at Washington State, told Digital Trends.There are two periods during the moon\u2019s formation in which these lunar conditions would have been such that life could have existed, the researchers argue. While these were many, many, many millennia apart, though, we\u2019re still talking about a long time ago in both instances. As noted, one was 3.5 billion years ago, during the moon\u2019s peak volcanic activity, while the other occurred even longer ago \u2014 at 4 billion years. Considering that the first sexually reproducing organisms only appeared on Earth 1.1 billion years ago, that means that \u2014 even if this is correct \u2014 there was almost certainly no crossover between Earth and moon life.The potential lunar life-forms, provided they existed, wouldn\u2019t have been much to write home about either. (If home at the time had been anything more than a barren hellhole in which the oceans perpetually boiled away into scorching steam atmospheres.) \u201cLife would only be on the microbial level similar to sulfur bacteria on Earth,\u201d Schulze-Makuch continued.Still, as Jeff Goldblum once said in Jurassic Park, \u201clife, uh, finds a way.\u201d Even if that life turns out to be extinct moon sulfur rather than the promised Little Gray Men!The research paper, titled \u201cWas There an Early Habitability Window for Earth\u2019s Moon?\u201d, was recently published in the journal Astrobiology.", "id": "278"}
{"content": "With Jermaine Johnson now committed, Georgia Football is loaded up on pass rushers like we\u2019ve never seen before. Could it become Pass Rush U?Georgia Football has developed a reputation over the years. Quite rightly, the Dawgs have become known as RBU thanks to all of the running backs they have put into the league. Needless to say that Sony Michel and Nick Chubb didn\u2019t hurt that image one bit. Nor will the fact that they currently have three 5-star running backs on campus right now.But there is another position where UGA might be even more loaded. Over the past few years, Georgia has recruited pass rushers at a rate that I for one have never seen. The 2017 class had Walter Grant and Robert Beal, both of whom are really talented. That was then surpassed by 2018 with three more top talents coming in. Now the 2019 class could be even better than that as UGA once again added two top talents.Grant and Beal are in the rotation already and could really make an impact this year. With some very talented young players behind them, I fully expect both of them to find a way to raise their level this year and make some plays. They are going to force the freshmen to try and take playing time away from them. That\u2019s not a given by any means and any pass rusher is going to have to earn every rep.All of which should excite UGA fans. Lorenzo Carter and Davin Bellamy were both DGD\u2019s who made huge impacts in Athens. However, neither possessed the raw pass rushing skills that Mel Tucker will have at his disposal going forward. All of this talent is making me just one thing. Is Georgia going to start to become known as the school that puts pass rushers into the league like they do running backs? If they do, then UGA could well become pass rusher U.", "id": "279"}

Apple's Fiscal Q3 earnings on Tuesday, July 31 Apple Inc. (AAPL) is slated to release its earnings after the bell on Tuesday. According to FactSet, analysts believe that the company will announce earnings of $2.16 a share.  Apple shares will likely out-perform once it beats earnings estimates says Ken Berman, a strategist with Gorilla Trades. \"I predict an all-around beat, possibly by as much as $1 billion in sales (over $53 billion) and up to seven cents ($2.26) on per-share earnings driven by a heavier mix of higher-priced iPhones, momentum in iPads and strength in services. Apple will be the first company in history to reach this milestone, but others will quickly follow, notably Amazon, then Alphabet, which I forecast will arrive before Microsoft,\" said Berman in an email. The earnings will bring FAANG's (Facebook, Apple, Amazon (AMZN) , Netflix (NFLX) , Alphabet (GOOGL) ) earnings season to a close. Here's why Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS team remain Apple bulls.

{"content": "Have you ever had a panic attack before? If you have, then you are aware that it is an overwhelming feeling. Although there are many descriptions for it, the best one would be that it feels like you are at war with your mind and you are the only soldier fighting against it. You have a feeling of impending doom, your body goes into fight or flight mode and it feels like you are going to die. However, there is a solution. Training yourself is the key to holding any type of panic attack at bay. With that thought, here are some steps you should keep in mind for guarding against an anxiety attack:Education is the first stepEducating yourself about your anxiety attacks can help you a great deal. Simply put, you need to figure out what triggers you and how to avoid it. Some out-of-the-box thinking could possibly be required. For example, if you are in a committed relationship, there is some research that co-sleeping with your spouse or significant other can make a huge difference on your emotional well-being. Furthermore, you should utilize education to help you understand the nature of your panic attacks, what to expect regarding your panic attacks and how to combat them when they occur.     Identify the signs of a panic attack and practice self-talkAlthough anxiety can happen at any time of day, one of the keys is to know what to do when you are having one. The signs are generally the same: you have heart palpitations, chest pains or sweaty Palms. Sometimes when you realize you\u2019re actually having one, many people exacerbated by going into full panic mode. However, you can utilize your realization of a panic attack to your own advantage. You can practice self talk, saying something to the effect of, \u201cthese are just signs that I\u2019m having a panic attack. Nothing bad is going to happen to me.\u201dTake deep breathsAlthough this can seem really hard, one of the most powerful techniques for overcoming anxiety attack would be to simply breathe deeply. Since this is easier said than done, many medical professionals recommend that you practice, starting with this little as 10 minutes before bed, in the shower or while you\u2019re doing some other type of household activities. The main endeavor is to breathe for 4 minutes, hold for 4 minutes and let out for another 2 to 4 minutes. Focus on the breathing in and breathing out and imagine all of your anxieties and fears going away with it. Increase the time on this technique every time you practice.     Practice grounding yourselfWhen you are having a panic attack, one way to counter balance it would be through grounding. This is an excellent form of natural treatment because it helps you rationalize your brain and helps you to avoid fighting with it. Moreover, it can be a great distraction tool. Some of these grounding strategies would include focusing on your feet on the ground, placing your hands on the steering wheel, or examining the texture of a wall. This helps you decrease focus on your stressful thoughts and decrease your anxiety.Use affirmative phrasesUsing affirmative phrases is all about replacing your negative thoughts with positive ones. Simply put, do you need to convince yourself of the positive. That means you say such things as, \u201cThis is just a panic attack. I\u2019ve been through worse.\u201d if you are not sure what to say, simply Google something to the effect of, \u201cmantras for anxiety\u201d and this will help you promote positive self-talk.Get some fresh airAnother great way for overcoming your anxiety attacks will be to simply just get a breath of fresh air. If you are out with friends, all you have to say is something like, \u201cexcuse me, I\u2019m going to get a little bit of fresh air.\u201d no one will judge you for it, because everyone, at times, needs exactly the same.Utilize the \u201cAware\u201d techniqueIf you have a considerably serious case of anxiety, this might be the way to go. First of all, be aware that the \u201caware\u201d technique is simply a literary device (see what I did there?) for conquering an anxiety attack that is made up of the following steps:A \u2013 Accept your anxiety attack symptoms.W \u2013 \u201cWatch over\u201d your attack, playing like you are someone else observing you.A \u2013 Act as if nothing has happened at all.R \u2013 Repeat these steps until you relax.E \u2013 Eliminate negative thinking and expect the best.ConclusionHaving an anxiety attack is no fun, but diligence is the key to avoiding your panic attacks. Educate yourself on the various techniques and there is no question in my mind that you will find a strategy that will work for you. Above all else, don\u2019t judge yourself; anxiety attacks happen to the best of us.", "id": "281"}

Could the lack of top-heaviness be a promising sign for the conference\u2019s future?When looking at each high-major conference\u2019s presence in the NCAA Tournament, it is quite clear that the Pac-12 has struggled to make a good impression on the selection committee.The Pac-12\u2019s total of 24 bids in the last 5 seasons is fewer than the Big East, Big 12, Big Ten and ACC. While it is equal to the SEC\u2019s total, the Pac-12 has not been moving in the same positive direction.While some of this can be attributed to the overall mediocrity of the Pac-12\u2019s middle, it could be argued that the top-heaviness of the conference has made the middle teams look worse. In fact, this became an issue for the Big 10, which had a decade low four bids last season.The teams in the Pac-12 have taken steps this offseason to improve and compete for more NCAA Tournament bids. The three teams predicted to be at the top \u2013 Oregon, UCLA, and Washington \u2013 are excellent, but the gap between them and the rest of the league is not as wide as in the past two seasons.Bids for the NCAA Tournament are based on overall team performance, not just their competitiveness in the conference. However, Pac-12 teams on the edge coming out of the non-conference should have a good shot at making a positive impression.While the other high-major conferences may still be stronger top-to-bottom leagues, the Pac-12 has a good chance of turning their reputation around. There is still a long way to go, but the Conference of Champions is heading in the right direction.", "id": "282"}
{"content": "Google introduced the Titan Security Key during its Google Cloud Next \u201918 convention, a physical USB-based device that eliminates the need to enter usernames and passwords. The FIDO-based device includes firmware developed by Google\u2019s engineers that verifies its integrity, so you can log onto your favorite sites worry-free. It\u2019s available now for Google Cloud customers followed by a full mainstream availability \u201csoon.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve long advocated the use of security keys as the strongest, most phishing-resistant authentication factor for high-value users, especially cloud admins, to protect against the potentially damaging consequences of credential theft,\u201d the company states.Google\u2019s key is based on the FIDO U2F protocol, short for \u201cuniversal 2nd factor.\u201d Borrowing from the smart card concept, you merely insert the key into a USB port or tap it against an NFC-compatible smartphone. When you create an online account (or update your existing security preferences), your PC will create two encrypted tokens: one public and one private.Later when you log into the account, the service containing the public token will send a \u201cchallenge\u201d requiring you to touch a button on the key, thus unlocking the private token for verification. There\u2019s no personal information sent across the internet, and the private token used to unlock the service remains solely on the physical key.Google and Yubico originally developed this protocol along with support by NXP but now its maintained by the FIDO Alliance. Yubico already offers its YubiKey series for desktop and mobile, such as the YubiKey 4 supporting multiple protocols, the Android-friendly YubiKey NEO, and the Security Key with out-of-the-box support for Gmail, Facebook, and more.That said, Google\u2019s new Titan Security Key will be in direct competition with Yubico\u2019s products. The difference is that one of Google\u2019s models will rely on a Bluetooth Low Energy component, a standard Yubico helped build but decided not to use because \u201cit does not meet our standards for security, usability, and durability.\u201d Bluetooth, according to Yubico, doesn\u2019t offer the same security level as NFC and USB.There\u2019s no information about the Titan Security Key\u2019s manufacturer, but Google plans to sell both USB- and Bluetooth-based models in a bundle for $50 or separately for around $25 each \u2014 possibly in the sub-$10 range in the future. Moreover, the Titan Security Key won\u2019t have anything to do with Google\u2019s Titan-branded chip used to protect cloud-based servers.\u201cTitan Security Key gives you even more peace of mind that your accounts are protected, with assurance from Google of the integrity of the physical key,\u201d Google says.Although smartphones are good for two-factor authentication, SMS-based messages can be intercepted. Even more, if your smartphone is lost or damaged, it takes your private keys with it. A USB-based key can get damaged as well, but it can hang on a keychain and doesn\u2019t require a network connection. According to Google, the Bluetooth model can supposedly remain active for six months on a single charge.Google will initially target customers who need the Titan Security Key the most: Journalists, business executives, politicians, and the like.", "id": "283"}

{"content": "July 27--SAN JOSE -- The development alongside the Tamien station, a joint light rail and Caltrain stop, would include an estimated 568 residential units and 3,000 square feet of ground-floor retail, according to planning documents on file with the city of San Jose.\"The idea is to put market rate and affordable housing units right next to transit stations like Tamien,\" said Konstantin Voronin, land acquisition director with Republic Urban, the principal developer of the project.The ground-floor commercial space would likely be a child care center or the type of local-serving retail seen in a big residential project.\"The entire development is 24 percent affordable\" and will contain a \"mix of 1-, 2- and 3-bedroom units,\" according to a presentation prepared by the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority, or VTA.Of the 568 residences being planned, 433 units, or 76 percent of the total, would be market rate apartments, while 135, or 24 percent, would be offered as affordable domiciles, the VTA report stated.The 135 units would be set aside for people in three categories of low-income households, using a complex formula derived from the U.S. Housing and Urban Development average median income in Santa Clara County of $125,200.One-third of those would be set aside for people with household family incomes of roughly $68,860 a year, another third would be offered to households with a yearly income of approximately $53,200 and one-third would be available to people with an annual household income of about $40,690, based on information derived from a VTA presentation.The site, located on Lick Avenue near Floyd Street and between Willow Street and West Alma Avenue, is at present a parking lot for the Tamien Station and also is the site of a Bright Horizons child care center. Republic Urban wanted to retain Bright Horizons as part of the new residential project, but the children's facility didn't want to stay. So Republic intends to find another child care company for the future development.The prospect of a major development boom in downtown San Jose -- some of which is already underway -- helped fuel the plans for the new residential project.Google has proposed a transit-oriented community of offices, residences, shops, restaurants and open spaces near the Diridon train station, a development where 15,000 to 20,000 of the search giant's employees would eventually work.San Jose-based Adobe Systems intends to build a new office tower next to its existing three-building downtown headquarters campus, marking a big expansion fueled by major employee growth.\"You have Google coming in with 20,000 jobs, and we would be just down the line from Diridon Station,\" Voronin said.Republic hopes that the seven-acre development fits the concept of a transit-oriented project that could help people live near their work, have access to a rail connection with links to other parts of the Bay Area such as San Francisco and the East Bay, and rely less on their cars.\"We will try anything to get housing closer to transit, and we want this to be as dense a project as possible, with as many units as possible,\" Voronin said.___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "285"}
{"content": "Scheduled routines is finally coming to Google Assistant. With it, users can set routines that automatically go off even without asking Google to do them. ( Alex Wong | Getty Images )Google promised it would add the ability to schedule routines within Assistant earlier this year, and now it's honoring its word.In addition to multi-step routines, which allow users to perform several actions \u2014 toggle the lights, ring the alarm, turn on smart home appliances \u2014 with just one command, Google is adding scheduled routines to make the feature even more useful.How To Schedule Routines On Google AssistantDroid Life first spotted the apparent rollout on Reddit, with some users saying they saw the option appear on the Google Home app. To craft routines, go to Settings, then Routines, and then tap the \"+\" sign. There should now also be an option to \"Set a time and delay (optional).\" For those who aren't seeing that last option yet, check back after a day or two; Google says it's rolling the feature out over the next few days.Why is scheduling routines useful? Well, for people actively using routines, this could be a pretty convenient way of setting up their Assistant-enabled devices so as to automatically perform actions at a set time and date. For example, a user can schedule a routine every morning where Assistant turns off the lights or toggles the phone off its silent mode instead of asking Google each time. It doesn't just work for mornings, by the way: users can also set afternoon or nightly routines as well. Just as long as a user has the necessary smart home equipment needed to perform a function, it can be included in a scheduled routine.Is Google Locking You Into Its Ecosystem Again?While a lot of these devices already have built-in scheduling features that can be toggled on via third-party apps, Google making scheduling native to Google Assistant brings everything under one roof, as TechCrunch notes \u2014 this might just be part of Google's increasing attempts to keep people locked into one app. The company recently rolled out a feature on Search that displays nearby events in a clean, convenient layout, so people are less likely to go to, say, other events app for the same functions.Of course, Google Assistant doesn't have the power or sufficient tools \u2014 for now, at least \u2014 to replace default smart home apps entirely. In any case, allowing users to schedule routines is a smart move, one that takes Assistant a notch above Alexa, Siri, Bixby, and other digital assistants.What do you think of Google Assistant routines?

{"content": "Plastic surgeons are concerned because more and more people are getting plastic surgery to look like their favorite Snapchat filters. What exactly is Snapchat dysmorphia? ( Isaac Moon | Pixabay )People nowadays are getting plastic surgery based on their favorite social media filters. Doctors from Boston University School of Medicine write about an emerging phenomena called Snapchat dysmorphia.Filtered PhotographsToday, apps such as Snapchat give members of the public a chance to change their appearance at the push of a button, whether one chooses to have a dog ears, a flower crown, or smoother skin. While this is just plain fun to many, the rise of such accessible photo editing technology also gave way to a new phenomenon called Snapchat dysmorphia.According to a paper published in JAMA Facial Plastic Surgery, more and more people nowadays get plastic surgeries in order to look rather like their filtered versions, with many wanting to have features such as bigger eyes, fuller lips, and thinner noses.While such procedures are not really rare, the authors note that it is the prevalence and easy access to photo editing and filters that feed the people\u2019s desires to change their appearance. For instance, in the past, when photo editing was not as readily available, people refer to celebrities and models for beauty inspiration, but now that even coworkers, classmates, and relatives get to alter their appearance at the click of a button, it brings about feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem in some and may trigger body dysmorphic disorder (BDD).Snapchat DysmorphiaThe phenomenon is now being referred to as Snapchat dysmorphia because of its link to social media influences. It is based on BDD, which is marked by an excessive preoccupation with a perceived \u201cflaw\u201d in physical appearance and the persistent need to change the said flaw. Often, people with this disorder visit dermatologists and plastic surgeons in order to change their appearance.Now, with the widespread use of photo editing and social media apps, people have started changing the way they see themselves. In fact, the American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery reported that about 55 percent of people who go to plastic surgeons do so because they want to look better in selfies.Social Media And Mental HealthMore worrying, however, is how such a phenomenon is affecting the mental health of many users. In a recent study, it was found that the adolescent girls who manipulated their photographs had higher levels of concern with their bodies and tend to overestimate their body weight and shape. The same study also revealed that those with a dysmorphic image of their bodies tend to use social media as a means of self-validation, and that those who are actively trying to present a specific image of themselves in social media tend to have a higher level of body dissatisfaction.\u201cThese apps allow one to alter his or her appearance in an instant and conform to an unrealistic and often unattainable standard of beauty,\u201d the doctors note, also stating that such apps may place pressure on people to look in a certain way and may make people lose touch with reality because of the idea that people have to look perfect and filtered in reality as well.Earlier this year, another paper also analyzed the issue of Snapchat dysmorphia, and authors concluded that plastic surgeons now need to be on the lookout for such patients and to know when to advise them to seek counseling instead of plastic surgery.Snapchat has not commented on the matter, but representatives for Facetune argue that their app is actually breaking the illusion of body ideals since everyone is using it.

{"content": "July 26--At the age of 80, the Michigan-born Martha Henry has played many of the roles in the Shakespeare canon during her 44 years at the flagship theater of her adopted Canada. As 10 artistic directors came and went, Henry wended her way through Lady Macbeth and Lady MacDuff, Goneril and Cordelia, Titania and Paulina. Heck, she played most every significant woman of Shakespeare's imagination, beginning in 1962 with Miranda, opposite William Hutt's Prospero.But here is what Henry had not done until this summer in director Antoni Cimolino's production of \"The Tempest\": played opposite no one.This year, Henry is Prospero herself. And there never was one more qualified.Prospero -- widely viewed as the Shakespearen alter ego, if not his vehicle for saying \"so long, suckers\" at the end of his playwriting career -- delivers the Bard's greatest climactic monologue, a plea to the audience to be freed. And in all my years watching shows at this theater, a miragelike fountain of excellence among the flat farmed lands of Ontario, I have never seen anything quite like the experience of watching Henry get to say, her cheeks wet with tears, \"Gentle breath of yours my sails must fill, or else my project fails, which was to please.\"As far as I know Henry is not retiring, and Cimolino surely has no intention of sending one of his most valuable actors prematurely up to the heavens.But there is no mistaking how this pair, in tandem with the mystical design of Bretta Gerecke, have together approached the end of \"The Tempest,\" which is to fuse the biography of a great and now aged Shakespearean actress finally freed, through the magic of Prospero and our halting progress as a species, to play a powerful man with agency. Henry gets to say lines that no woman has ever said at this theater -- and that every creature of the theater covets. When she gets to the last three words of \"Now I want spirits to enforce, art to enchant,\" she hammers them home partly like someone delivering their own eulogy but also like a high school valedictorian who cares about arts education. And then she disappears up into the sky, an artist transformed into spirit.Acting can be a crummy life, but as I watched, I kept thinking about how this theater was at least allowing one of its true greats one heck of an exit. Most workers -- should they be lucky enough not to already be put out to pasture at age 80 -- end their careers with a cake or a hurried after-work beer, if not a brutal pink slip. Henry gets Shakespeare's finest gust of wind in her sails. How lucky for her.There is more to \"The Tempest,\" of course, than Henry's Prospero, including a fascinating performance from Mamie Zwettler, making her Stratford debut as Miranda. Young Zwettler, who looks at Henry as one so compelled as to have no other choice, is reminiscent of the British actress Carey Mulligan, or so you think, at least, until you see the pictures from 1962 of Henry playing Miranda. I have no idea if such casting was conscious, but it certainly feels like Henry is acting right alongside her ingenue self.It's all a reminder of the pleasures afforded to an audience by long-term commitments of employment to great actors such as Henry, who age in their work. We see this all too rarely in the theater now, which is pretty much the embodiment of the gig economy. Only administrators grow old in their jobs. But Stratford has understood (and been able to fund) better than most the truth that the theater is in the business of relationships, and that beloved performers always fuse with their characters, which is precisely how and why Shakespeare wrote his plays.'Coriolanus'Maybe \"The Tempest\" is not the aesthetic equal of director Robert Lepage's dazzlingly precise \"Coriolanus,\" surely the greatest contemporary staging of this play that I ever have seen. But I know which of the festival's two marquee Shakespeare productions made me feel more, and that had everything to do with Henry, and Cimolino's embrace of her most personal legacy.You could argue, of course, that such is mere sentiment. And that can cloud clarity of observation of the human condition. Lepage would surely make that case. Lepage, working at Stratford for the first time and never known as the touchy-feely type, has been obsessed with controlling what the audience sees as long as I have been watching his work.Lepage achieves that narrative control -- and dazzlingly so -- partly through focus and rigorous detail: in this production, he has an idea for every scene, and an idea that works. But his other method is the literal shading of the stage though his trademark black boxes; he constantly is closing down one vista and opening up another. At times, all you can see is a single well-positioned face of an actor, soon to be sucked into the void. No one can do the theatrical equivalent of the movie close-up, or a cinematic blackout, quite like Lepage.At its core, \"Coriolanus\" is the tragedy of a great leader, a war hero, who is thoroughly irritated by the pesky democratic notion that a politician should be accountable to the people. You might see shades of the current president or his Russian counterpart but, frankly, most politicians, especially those with a military past, come to have complex relationships with the \"being liked\" part of the job. The longer they serve, the more they think they know better than the great unwashed. Maybe they do. Maybe they don't. That's what this lesser-known play is all about.Shakespeare -- whose sympathies, like George Bernard Shaw, often seemed to be more with the intellectual elites than the deplorables -- does not hesitate to show us the downside of the populace, as he does in \"Julius Caesar,\" through the presence in \"Coriolanus\" of his fine pair of Brutus (Stephen Ouimette) and Sicinius (Tom Rooney). Like many populists, these two leaders know how to exploit those who only intermittently pay attention to the facts. But there is, of course, no alternative to suffering the errors of the ballot box. Not beyond either fascism or dictatorship.Setting the show in modern-day Rome, Lepage, who both directs and set designs with a level of auteur control unusual at this collaborative theater, shows us many vistas on this conundrum. Coriolanus is discussed in restaurants and at fat-cat eateries until he is forced to flee in his car. He ultimately is brought to his senses by Volumnia (Lucy Peacock), his own mother, an assertive pragmatist if ever there was one in Shakespeare's world. But it's too late for him to turn back.Lepage, his company Ex Machina, and his Stratford collaborators somehow wrangle a difficult play into a heart-stopping narrative that puts you in mind of a Martin Scorsese film, a noir melange of whispered conversations, insecure familial bonhomie and an overall air of imminent unfettered doom for democracy. There is even a knockout scene of exposition by texting, replete with an emoji that, in this mercurial staging of an unstintingly wide-eyed drama of the omnipresent consequences of human fear, makes all the sense in the world.The raging but buttoned-down star of \"Coriolanus,\" Andre Sills, seems not to know himself at all, which is precisely what the play demands. He could not be further from Martha Henry, of course, just as Lepage and Cimolino are polar opposites.But on one remarkable weekend of Shakespeare, one offers insight into the painful reality on our television screens, and the other just a hint of immortality.If only, Ms. Henry!'The Rocky Horror Show'Once Richard O'Brien's \"The Rocky Horror Show\" went to the pictures, it could never be the same,Thanks to a thousand flea-pit midnight showings of the 1980s, and beyond, the tawdry 1973 London satire of B-movie pulp became an interactive bacchanal fueled by Bud Light and dominated by Gen Xers looking to earn their letter. And, in the years that followed, this appropriation mostly confused the live theater and its patrons.Was cosplay something to encourage? Oughtn't the door be shown to those who loudly added the line \"for the football team\" when Janet said she was saving herself?Most live renditions of \"The Rocky Horror Show\" fell somewhere in between and, as a consequence, were about as awkward as virginal Brad and Janet before they meet Frank N. Furter, the hands-on counselor and advocate of the life pleasurably lived. For what else we got going?At Stratford, though, the director Donna Feore has gone all in. Not only has she embraced the show's R-rated but singular place in the cultural gestalt, her production has made its verbal interactivity a scripted part of the attraction, even if people are asked to remember, should they feel the urge to throw something, that these are live actors. Audience plants lurk in the house, helping patrons remember what to do and, at the rather staid matinee I saw, doing it for them. It's less organic, for sure, but it also allows the actors to know what's coming and work it into what they're doing. When you add a scenic environment from Michael Gianfrancesco that feels thoroughly digital until it thrusts into the necessary third dimension of sexual congress, you get a winning hybrid of the cinematic and the very much live.I imagine O'Brien, who was never ambivalent about what happened to his baby, took some persuading to go along with this. And I further imagine the board of trustees at a theater with an audience dominated by teachers and erudite souls of a certain age had some pause. But \"Rocky Horror\" really is kind of a triumph, in its ridiculous way, in that it feels like a re-creation of a lost property with a score which is, to my mind, and I know some differ, very much the equal of, say, \"Little Shop of Horrors.\" And, palpably, it's a hit, with the (somewhat) younger audiences all theaters covet arriving in droves from Toronto and beyond, entirely ready to party.None of this would work without bravura vocals and charm from Dan Chameroy as the sweet transvestite from transsexual wherever and, notably, from Jennifer Rider-Shaw, who gives Janet a power in delicious contrast to her usual demure persona. Add in a very muscular and funny Rocky (George Krissa) and a frenetic Columbia (Kimberly-Ann Truong) and the eye hardly knows where to look.Feore is far better than many Broadway directors at finding a legit rock sensibility, as distinct from a fussier theatrical one, which she achieves through attitude, pacing, volume, pyrotechnics of song, and, most significantly, a raucous sensibility. Many elements of \"Rocky Horror\" affront current sensibilities -- for one thing, Frank N. Furter exchanges in plenty of consent-free manipulation of identity. This show can only work now if everyone feels safe and the time-warped world nonthreatening, which Feore somehow achieves while also maintaining enough edginess that you feel at least a whiff of fear for human sexuality when Frank's idealized sex doll flexes his perfection.Hmm. Not so sweet after all. And, now, not so far from reality.'The Music Man'Closer, certainly, than \"The Music Man,\" which, improbably, Feore takes on in the same season.The repertory system always is fun for the audience, but there is something especially entertaining in watching the weirdos of \"Rocky Horror\" transform themselves into demure Iowans, all failing to avoid trouble in River City despite their pretty attire. It's hard to get the force of the contrast in style and assumption out of your mind. I saw \"The Music Man\" the very same day. There was theatrical whiplash.But it's also true that Frank N. Furter and Harold Hill have a lot more in common than first meets the eye. Feore's star, African-American actor Daren A. Herbert, is very much the disrupter of Iowan complacency, just as Frank goes after those heteronormative rules. In fact, Feore is both delivering the kind of \"Music Man\" that can attract 1,800 people or more to the Festival Theatre -- her own choreography is richly engaging and plenty showy and, on the surface, the show checks every box that any Ontarian might wish -- while also emphasizing the radical ideas that lie at the core of Meredith Willson's musical.In this production, Hill mentors the young townsperson Tommy Djilas, who is also played by an African-American actor, Devon Michael Brown of course, he turns the world of Marian the Librarian, played with longing and sadness by Danielle Wade, completely topsy-turvy. The other counterintuitive element to Herbert's very clever performance is that he turns a crucial theme of this musical -- that self-confidence is all it takes to succeed in America -- on its head.We all know that it was never true and, when it matters the most, Herbert and Feore allow you to see inside Harold and Marian's fears. What kind of life are they going to have in this town, you think, especially once folk stop obsessing over the band. It's as if you're watching \"The Music Man\" fused with \"Get Out.\"You have to want to see this, of course. But if you do, it's there. Feore operates on many levels; she's overdue for Broadway.Chris Jones is a Tribune critic.cjones5@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "288"}
{"content": "The Dallas Stars cut ties with all of their UFAs on July 1, 2018, but not all of them landed on their feet immediately. Dan Hamhuis went over three weeks without a new contract. But on Wednesday morning, he got his deal.Dan Hamhuis spent the past two years of his career playing for the Dallas Stars. But for the two seasons ahead, he\u2019ll be in a constant battle against the Stars.On Wednesday morning, the Nashville Predators announced that they had signed the defenseman to a contract. The deal, which is for two years and carries an AAV of $1.25 million, came a little later than most expected.When the 2018 free agency frenzy opened up on July 1, Hamhuis seemed to be one of the top defensive UFA options on the market. After a solid 2017-18 showing with the Dallas Stars, the 35-year-old was in search of a new deal to give him one last chance at competing for the Stanley Cup before calling it a career.It\u2019s probable that the Stars at least considered bringing Hamhuis back on a new contract. The veteran defender had already talked one-on-one with new head coach Jim Montgomery and was seen as an affordable option where Dallas already knew what they were getting. And with the overwhelmingly young defensive group forming on the Stars\u2019 blue line, any veteran help would be welcomed.But on July 1, the Dallas Stars went in a different direction, signing right-handed defenseman Roman Polak to a one-year contract. It was a cheap deal for a weathered defender and eliminated any chance of Dallas bringing Hamhuis back.With that, Hamhuis entered free agency in search of another home where he could compete. His extensive resume and fairly consistent 2017-18 performance made him out to be one of the ideal options for a team looking to add depth and experience to their blue line.But while four of the Stars\u2019 six UFAs signed new deals on July 1, . And while Lehtonen is still on the market, looking for a new gig, Hamhuis is now locked in with Nashville for two years.In his two years with the Stars, Hamhuis showed all the signs of being a capable leader and producer on defense that could play anywhere in the lineup. He skated top minutes with John Klingberg as well as playing a depth role alongside Greg Pateryn or Stephen Johns during his two seasons in Dallas.He isn\u2019t known for his offensive talent, but instead for his ability to play a smart and solid two-way game. His 24 points ranked third among Dallas defenders last season and his possession numbers were respectable. He can also play big minutes (he averaged 20:11 this past season), is an effective penalty killer, and moves the puck well.Hamhuis was a flexible defender for the Stars that filled a hole and gave Dallas options on the blue line and on special teams. He built his career back up this past season after a few years of recession and earned himself a new contract at the age of 35.Nashville will likely use him in the same role as Dallas did, giving him a depth opportunity and time on special teams. And with his workhorse style, they might also use him in tight contests where the game is on the line. Confidence is key, and Hamhuis has it.The Dallas Stars meet up with the Nashville Predators five times in the 2018-19 season, so Dallas will get a chance to see a lot of Hamhuis on the other side. He was a dedicated soldier for the Stars\u2019 blue line for two seasons and now has yet another chance to compete for a Cup. And with his move, the Central Division battle once again becomes moreDallas first plays Nashville on Nov. 10 at the American Airlines Center. Make sure to get your tickets if you want to see the grizzled vet back in the city.Only one Dallas UFA left on the market.", "id": "289"}

{"content": "Aug. 01--As Bears first-round pick Roquan Smith continues his holdout over contract language regarding the new NFL helmet-contact rule, his teammates will be the first players to put the rule to the test.Nobody is quite sure how it will play out.\"It's going to be an extremely hard play to officiate, other than the super obvious,\" defensive coordinator Vic Fangio said Tuesday after the Bears' final practice before the Hall of Fame Game against the Ravens on ThursdayThe new rule makes it illegal for players on offense and defense to lower their heads and initiate contact with their helmets. An infraction will result in a 15-yard penalty. A player can also be ejected if he lowers his helmet to establish a linear body posture before making contact, if he had an unobstructed path to his opponent and if the contact was clearly avoidable.Fangio said the Bears have been teaching the new rule in meetings and showing a lot of video of plays that would be affected. They have had some live tackling sessions during training camp, but they haven't had a ton of opportunities to make sure they are avoiding the types of plays that will be penalized.\"There are some plays that will be hard to adjust,\" Fangio said. \"We'll just have to keep working on it. One of the most non-football rules ever put into football was the 5-yard illegal contact rule. If coaches from the '60s rose from the dead today, they would want to go back in their grave with that rule. And we've adjusted. I think they'll eventually adjust.\"Fangio and special teams coordinator Chris Tabor expect officials will throw many flags in exhibition games as teams and officials adjust, and the Bears will look at penalties as teaching moments for the regular season.\"We're going to have to change a little bit as we go throughout the year,\" Tabor said. \"And as penalties arise from that play, I think it will just be 'teach tape' for us in what they can and can't do.\"Despite Fangio's doubts about regulation of the rule, he understands the reasoning behind the change.\"Everything to improve the safety of the game is good,\" Fangio said. \"And the motives behind the rule are good. I'm just not sure in some cases if it's feasible.\"As for Smith, who is seeking financial protection from the Bears should he be ejected under the new rule, Fangio didn't bite on a question asking if he understood players' and agents' concerns.\"I'm not going to give you a line that you're going to print,\" he said.ckane@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "291"}

{"content": "There has been a lot of talks lately in regards to the role of Cleveland Cavaliers forward Cedi Osman this upcoming season.Cedi Osman had a wonderful summer league in the few games he played in, helping lead the Cleveland Cavaliers to a 2-1 record prior to the tournament\u2019s commencement.Going back to last year he had several moments where he flashed his full potential and what he can be capable of. But can he put everything together this season without LeBron James?Cedi was the 31st pick in the 2015 NBA draft. Originally drafted by the Timberwolves, his rights were immediately dealt to the Cleveland Cavaliers. He played overseas in the Turkish BSL and the Euroleague with Anadolu Efes before he ultimately coming to Cleveland.At 23-years-old, Cedi is the definition of a developmental player. He certainly wasn\u2019t a big name when he came into the league but through opportunities and showing his worth in the G-League he was able to gain some valuable playing time last year.In the middle of the year, he came up from the G-League and saw some valuable minutes with the Cavs. His best performance was against the Knicks last year in a breakout game where he posted 18 points, 7 assists, and 6 rebounds.Some people project Cedi as a starter this upcoming year due to all the roster changes that are happening within the Cavs organization.The opportunity is perfect for Cedi. This season could be the year for him to break out and grow into a starting role.He certainly has all the attributes to become a starter for the Cavs.As a 6-foot-8 forward he has the ability to spread the court with his length. He has a respectable shot and from the looks of his summer league performance, it\u2019s only getting better. Shooting 36.8 percent from three, he can even space the court adequately.He spent limited time in the NBA last year, so this year having a full season to play will help not only his stats but his skill set to increase significantly.What Cedi must do is produce consistently on the offensive end, something that the Cavaliers will struggle with this season. They only had two players who averaged double figures, meaning their team didn\u2019t have elite depth like they boasted.In addition to producing on the offensive end, Cedi must be efficient in doing so. On the defensive end, he has the tenacity, energy and size to cause havoc. Can he do that while playing 25 minutes per game instead of 11 though?His reputation of being a hustle player may quickly come to an end and Cedi the star much appear. This could be his breakout season but will he be able to take the heightened pressure?", "id": "295"}

According to court documents, McCartney told Santa Clara police detectives that he and Hyde went to drink at the park the previous night after a shift at the nearby Safeway supermarket on Homestead Road, where both men worked as butchers.Police stated that beforehand, the two had dinner at a local McDonald's, and returned to the supermarket to buy a bottle of liquor. They were seen in surveillance footage \"dancing in the video and appeared to be in good spirits and intoxicated,\" police said. That was around 11 p.m., and marks the last time Hyde was seen alive in public.McCartney reportedly told detectives that Hyde made several sexual advances toward him and that he punched and choked Hyde to keep him away. At one point, McCartney acknowledged that he \"put his hands on each side of the victim's neck and squeezed, causing him to fall to the ground,\" according to court documents.Police stated that McCartney told them \"he was shocked about what happened and was furious with the victim for making sexual advances toward him\" and that \"his instinct took over,\" but that he left the park believing he only left Hyde unconscious.Family and friends who appeared at Friday's hearing declined to comment to reporters. The Santa Clara County District Attorney's Office also declined to comment after the hearing, citing the pending arraignment, but issued a statement saying only that there is no evidence suggesting a racial motive in the attack.McCartney's claims about Hyde could be immaterial if he were to use them to defend his violent response: Presenting a so-called \"gay panic,\" or \"trans panic,\" defense was formally outlawed in California in 2014, making it the first state in the United States to do so.The ban was inspired by cases like the fatal 1998 beating of Matthew Shepard in Wyoming and the 2002 murder of Gwen Araujo in Newark, by attackers who presented gay and trans panic defenses at their trials.Rhode Island and Illinois are the other states to have banned this type of criminal defense, and Congressional legislation has been introduced to implement a federal ban. The American Bar Association has similarly called for an end to the defense in the broader criminal-justice system.Because of a lack of obvious signs of trauma, Hyde's death was not ruled a homicide until after an autopsy was performed, according to police. But early on, detectives suspected foul play and built on that suspicion after interviewing Hyde's family and friends.Police said Hyde \"was in the company\" of McCartney before he was found dead. McCartney was arrested Wednesday night at his home and booked into the Santa Clara County Main Jail, where he is being held without bail.McCartney declined a request for a jailhouse interview with this news organization.Besides being remembered as a warm and friendly presence in the Santa Clara community where he worked, Hyde was also known for his powerful singing voice at Cathedral of Faith church in San Jose, which he attended for the past three decades. The church plans to hold a celebration of Hyde's life.Anyone with information about the case can contact Detective Sgt. Nick Richards at 408-615-4814..___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "298"}
{"content": "Here is the biggest obstacle each team must overcome during the NFL 2018 season.With training camp officially underway for the NFL 2018 season, it\u2019s only a matter of time before Week 1 officially arrives in September, as all eyes will on which teams are talented enough to make a run at the Super Bowl in Atlanta. One of the best things about this time of year during training camp is every team is in a similar situation when it comes to having a fresh start for a new season, although that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean there still won\u2019t be obstacles along the way.For example, around this time last summer, the Dallas Cowboys were drawing praise as one of the early favorites to represent the NFC in the Super Bowl after emerging out of nowhere the year before by finishing with the best record in the conference. Normally, this wouldn\u2019t seem like that big of a deal when looking at the talent Dallas had to work with, but it was the idea they managed to do so while being led by two rookies on offense in Dak Prescott and Ezekiel Elliott that made it such a surprise.Unfortunately, between Prescott taking a step back by not making as much of an impact under center along with Elliott dealing with the fallout of a four-game suspension that seemed to change each week, the Cowboys came up short of earning a trip to the playoffs. And while Elliott will look to bounce back during his third NFL season with no distractions, the challenge with Prescott will be to learn from his mistakes as a sophomore.Otherwise, Dallas will find themselves at risk of watching the playoffs at home for a second year in a row. But before getting into more details on any obstacles the Cowboys may be facing in 2018, let\u2019s take a look at what some of the other teams across the league will be dealing with as well.", "id": "299"}
{"content": "Physicists proposed that black holes are actually giant balls of fuzzy energy, not the bringers of doom they are believed to be. The idea is based on string theory, which suggests that the universe is made of subatomic strings of energy. ( NASA | Wikimedia Commons )New research into the nature of black holes proposes these regions of immense gravitational force are not as ruthless as some experts may suggest.In fact, scientists at The Ohio State University say black holes are nothing more than giant harmless balls of cosmic strings that create imperfect copies of whatever falls into them.This runs counter to an earlier argument advanced by other experts, who said that black holes are enveloped by a curtain of energy that lights up whatever crosses its edge.Black Holes Are Massive Fuzzballs Of EnergyIn a new paper published in the Journal of High Energy Physics, a team of physicists led by Samir Mathur of OSU says black holes are massive fuzzballs that gain more mass as they suck more objects in.They say, as an object is drawn to the event horizon, the point at which there is no going back for anything that gets too close, the black hole's fuzzy surface rises up to meet the object before it can reach the part of hottest radiation.Black holes are regions in space with extreme gravitational pull. Even light, once it falls in, fails to get out. They are formed from the death of supermassive stars that condense all that material into a small, super-dense core. Scientists believe that black holes compress any object they pull in into infinite density.Hawking's Information ParadoxMathur and his team believe their fuzzball theory provides the best explanation for Stephen Hawking's information paradox.In the 1970s, Hawking said that any object that falls into a black hole could never escape. Unfortunately, this is in complete contradiction of a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics, which states that information can never be destroyed.In 2003, Mathur advanced the idea that black holes have defined surfaces covered in fuzzy strings of energy. Objects that get drawn in by a black hole's strong gravitational pull do not actually fall into the object; they fall onto it.Hawking later conceded that objects that fall into a black hole do not get destroyed. They simply become a part of the black hole, which means each black hole is a unique result of all the objects that fall into it.Firewall TheoryBuilding on Mathur's earlier work, scientists at the University of California, Santa Barbara, arrived at a different conclusion. They proposed that, instead of a fuzzy curtain, black holes are surrounded by a firewall. Any object that travels too close gets burned to a crisp as it enters the ring of fire.Here is how they came to that conclusion. Hawking and colleague Jacob Bekenstein observed that black holes emitted a soft glow of radiation. This was made of entangled pairs of particles near the event horizon.For every particle that is emitted, it has a pair that gets sucked into the event horizon. Eventually, however, the continuous radiation will have the black hole shooting out all particles, which means that all the information was not destroyed after all.The problem happens when quantum mechanics is taken into account. For every entangled particle that escapes as radiation, it requires an entangled pair to fall in. A particle can only be entangled with one other particle at a time. However, if information is not destroyed, the particle has to be entangled with more than one particle, which causes the information paradox.The proponents of the firewall theory argue that the particles escaping the black hole are entangled with more than one particle. However, the entanglement breaks the second it forms. This, they say, generates massive amounts of energy that creates a deadly border that annihilates any object passing through.Upending The Firewall Theory\"The firewall argument had seemed like a quick way to prove that something falling through the horizon burns up,\" says Mathur. \"But we now see that there cannot be any such quick argument; what happens can only be decided by detailed calculations in string theory.\"String theory attempts to marry Einstein's relativity theory and quantum mechanics to explain the way the universe works. It proposes the radical notion that the universe is made of vibrating strings of subatomic energy that is always changing shape.According to Mathur, if a person is tangled up in strings, there is no way to decide how he will feel. In 2015, Mathur said the world could pass through a black hole, and no one would be any wiser about what was going on. The black hole would simply create an imperfect copy of the world, and both would continue to exist as before.The debate over the fuzzball/firewall issue has enormous implications for the study of physics. If black holes are indeed fuzzballs creating copies of whatever touches their surface, the universe may actually be a hologram that sits on a surface in more dimensions than we know.\"If the surface of a black hole is a firewall, then the idea of the universe as a hologram has to be wrong,\" Mathur said.", "id": "300"}
{"content": "Aug. 02--In a dramatic change from recent years, the state's largest health insurer is proposing lowering the premiums on many of the plans it sells through the state's Obamacare exchange next year.Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois wants to lower average rates slightly for many of its plans for individuals, by anywhere from 0.84 percent to about 1.5 percent, according to data released by the federal government Wednesday. It's the first time Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois has proposed an average rate reduction since the exchange opened, said Blue Cross spokeswoman Colleen Miller. The insurer is proposing one average increase, to its BlueCare Direct plans, but only by 0.25 percent.Other insurers that sell plans on Illinois' Obamacare exchange are proposing increases in next year's premiums, but not of the magnitude of years past. Celtic Insurance Co. is proposing increases of about 1 percent or less. Cigna is proposing an average increase of 10.7 percent. And Health Alliance Medical Plans is proposing average increases of about 10 percent or less.At this time last year, average proposed rate increases ranged from 5 percent to 43 percent.The proposals released Wednesday are the result of a complex series of calculations made by insurers and will likely be finalized in coming months. Open enrollment to buy coverage through the exchange will begin Nov. 1, for coverage beginning Jan. 1.The proposals come as the Trump administration continues to try to weaken Obamacare, more formally called the Affordable Care Act. The administration has already taken a number of steps to offer consumers alternatives to purchasing exchange plans, and Congress passed a tax bill last year that will, starting in 2019, eliminate Obamacare's requirement that everyone buy insurance or pay a penalty.Most consumers get health insurance through their employers or through government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. But this year, more than 300,000 Illinois residents are covered by insurance plans purchased on the exchange.In its rate filings, Blue Cross said it took a number of factors into account when proposing rates, including the administration's changes.\"We know that health coverage still remains out of reach for many,\" Miller said in an email. \"It's critical that we find the right balance of affordability for consumers and stability in the market so premiums don't vary dramatically from year to year.\"Cigna took into account customer claims, expected medical costs and overall market performance, among other things, said Cigna spokeswoman Holly Fussell in an email.\"The long-term success of the individual health insurance market starts with rational, competitive pricing, as reflected in our filing,\" Fussell said.Cigna, Blue Cross and Celtic all offered exchange plans in Cook County, among other places, this year.Illinois is one of a number of states where insurers are actually proposing price decreases after years of double-digit jumps.Insurers hiked rates for this year amid uncertainty over changes to Obamacare at the time they were setting their rates. In some cases, however, insurers might have set rates too high, and they're now correcting for that, said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at Georgetown University's Center on Health Insurance Reforms.\"I think the worst of it was felt this year and, in many cases, was actually an overshooting on the part of the carriers, and I think maybe some of the carriers may feel they've weathered the worst of the storm,\" Corlette said.In other cases, such as in Minnesota, states got permission from the federal government to set up reinsurance programs, in which the state and the federal government kicked in to help insurers handle high cost claims -- a strategy that helped lower premiums this year, she said.The information released Wednesday by the federal government shows only by how much insurers plan to increase or decrease premiums for exchange plans for next year, on average. The Illinois Department of Insurance plans to release more detailed information about plans and costs in October, once they're finalized.The proposed rate increases came out the same day the Trump administration relaxed rules to allow consumers to use short-term health insurance plans longer, as an alternative to buying exchange plans. The short-term plans could be used for only three months at a time, but the Trump administration will allow them now to be used for a year and renewed for up to three years.They are generally cheaper than plans offered on the exchange, but they often don't cover things like maternity care, pre-existing conditions or prescription medications.Illinois lawmakers recently passed bills that would limit short-term plans' use to six months in the state, amid concerns that their lower levels of coverage could leave consumers on the hook for pricey medical care and that they could attract large numbers of healthy consumers, leading to higher premiums for those who continue buying insurance on the exchange.Those bills are now before Gov.

{"content": "If the bar for Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk was to make it through an earnings call without calling anyone a \"boring bonehead,\" consider it met. A subdued Musk muttered his way through Tesla's June quarter earnings call with investors, at one point apologizing for being tired -- \"I've been working in the body shop,\" he said -- and at two other points apologizing to analysts for what he called his \"bad manners\" on Tesla's May earnings call, also citing a lack of sleep.  \"I hope you'll accept my apology,\" he said to Joseph Spak of RBC Capital, the analyst Musk cut off for being too dry before turning to a Tesla cheerleader on Youtube. The apology was accepted, and the awkward moments brought some color to a call that otherwise meandered from topics including production rates, and plans for funding a Gigafactory in China to its insistence that it won't need to raise any capital as it continues to spend heavily on Model 3 production.  Tesla's earnings release was a mixed bag: The carmaker reported slightly more revenue than expected, at $4 billion versus an analyst consensus of $3.9 billion, but higher losses than expected at an adjusted loss of $3.06 per share versus a consensus of $2.92. Tesla also said that it had hit its goal of producing 5,000 Model 3 cars per week \"multiple times\" throughout the month of July, and projected that they would produce between 50,000 and 55,000 Model 3 units over the whole of Q3. The earnings call seemed to serve a dual purpose of elaborating on Tesla's progress and showing a humbled Musk who also made a point of lavishing colleagues with praise for their \"mind-blowing\" achievements in the past quarter. Musk reiterated the company's position that it will turn a profit in Q3, and took the forecast further in declaring that Tesla will be profitable for every quarter from there on out. With a few caveats at least: It will be profitable barring events like a recession, or \"needing to pay back a loan,\" Musk said. (Tesla has about $1.2 billion in convertible debt obligations maturing later this year and in early 2019.) Asked how Tesla will fund massive projects like a China Gigafactory, he said that it would turn to Chinese banks. \"I think our default plan would be to essentially use a loan from the local banks in China and fund the Gigafactory in Shanghai with local debt... we certainly could raise money but I think we do not need to.\" Musk also denied that a notice from the SEC is preventing Tesla from raising money, per the rumor that a Wells notice is what's keeping the company from fundraising. \"Are we running low on money? The answer is no,\" Musk added on the call. Tesla reported lower cash burn than expected, forecasting capital expenditures for 2018 of less than $2.5 billion versus prior estimates of less than $3 billion. In the earnings release, Tesla reported a cash pile of $2.2 billion.  Its Model 3 production numbers and sales are \"the most salient issues\" for Tesla, said automotive analyst Jeremy Acevedo of Edmunds: \"What they're forecasting for Q3 seems fairly aggressive and on pace. It'll be interesting to see if that's sustainable through next quarter,\" said Acevedo. Investors took Wednesday's events as good news on the whole, with Tesla's stock up about 9% in after-hours trading.", "id": "302"}
{"content": "July 30--REDDING -- A moment of silence was about all they had before suiting up at the fairgrounds to try to control the Carr Fire that had already burned nearly 100,000 acres in Shasta County over the past week, and destroyed 966 structures, including 723 homes. Over the past two-and-a-half weeks, two firefighters have died in the Carr fire and two others -- including an 82-year-old bulldozer operator -- died in the Ferguson Fire in Yosemite, an unprecedented number of fatalities so early in the fire season.\"I want you to take care of yourself,\" Mike Ming, who leads Cal Fire's employee support services program, told the gathering. \"Take care of your crews. Take care of your families. Just know that we're all hoping, and I'm sure you're all hoping, that you're going to return home, happy and healthy, to your families when this thing's all over.\"As 17 wildfires rage across California, stretching Cal Fire resources, the men and women battling the flames are doing so while also reckoning with their own grief and unease as the firefighter fatality count ticks up to an alarming height.Four firefighter deaths so far this year is more than were killed in California wildfires in all of 2017, Cal Fire Battalion Chief Jonathan Cox said.It's taking a toll.\"We're battling two fronts -- we're battling the fire, but we're also kind of battling this mourning that we're as firefighters processing as well,\" Cox said. \"It's not easy. It's by no means easy. But we do what we do in everybody's honor who put their lives out there for us.\"The death count is growing partly because this year's fires have been larger, more destructive and more frequent, Cox said. That's caused by the merging of several factors, he said, extreme weather -- hotter days and hotter nights -- and increased development in rural areas, coupled with a heat wave and wind. The Carr Fire was driven by an unusual \"fire vortex\" or \"fire tornado\" that generated its own devastating weather and path of destruction.Along with the firefighters, four Shasta County residents have also been killed, including a 70-year-old woman and her two great-grandchildren and someone who was found in an evacuated home.On Monday, cooler temperatures and calmer winds were good news for firefighters who by morning had the Carr Fire 20 percent contained. Cal Fire send 17 helicopters to drop water on the blaze.\"It means that hopefully the fire activity will be not as great as it was in the first few days of the fire, where you saw the fire tornado,\" Cal Fire public information officer Daniel Potter said in an interview after the briefing, \"because the winds won't be there so it will be a less productive fire, so we can get more containment done faster.\"Firefighters on Monday were focused on keeping the blaze out of the towns of Lewiston to the northwest and Igo to the south. Another incentive to keep the fire from moving south -- winds tend to pick up in that region, and can routinely reach speeds of 30 mph.The four firefighter deaths came with intense heat in Northern California. Brian Hughes, 33 of Hawaii, was struck and killed by a falling tree while fighting the Ferguson Fire on Sunday. At the same fire July 14, Braden Varney, 36, was killed when his bulldozer rolled over.At the Carr Fire, Jeremy Stoke, 37, a fire inspector with the Redding Fire Department, was killed. In a grim reminder of firefighters' work ethic, Stoke's funeral is being postponed until his colleagues, still battling the blaze, can attend.Don Smith, an 82-year-old bulldozer operator and private contractor from Pollock Pines, was also killed in the Carr Fire, when he was overrun Friday by the flames east of Whiskeytown Lake. His advanced age raised concerns about his fitness for the challenging duty and whether a heart attack or other cardiac event could have been a contributing factor.\"Most people aren't out there operating dozers and fighting fire at that age,\" said Cliff Allen, president of Cal Fire Local 2881, the union that represents Cal Fire employees, \"so it's pretty unusual.\"A coroner was investigating the death of Smith, a contractor with Robert Dominikus General Engineering, to determine if other factors were involved.Sixty firefighters died on duty last year, according to the National Fire Protection Association's annual report. Of those, more than half of the firefighters over age 40 succumbed to heart attacks or other cardiac events. The rate for firefighters age 60 and over was 2.5 times the average.Cal Fire spokeswoman Lynne Tolmachoff said Monday there is no mandatory retirement age for contractors and no physical tests they must perform. It's up to each contractor to ensure their employees' fitness, she said.In Shasta County, dozens of roadways remain closed, including large portions of state Highway 299 and Highway 273. Another 5,012 structures remained in harm's way, Cal Fire said.The Ferguson Fire near Yosemite, burning for more than two weeks, has burned 56,659 acres and is 30 percent contained, according to Cal Fire.The Ranch and River fires, dubbed the Mendocino Complex fires, began in Mendocino County and have since crossed into Lake County. Together, the two fires have scorched 56,000 acres.At the Carr Fire command post at the Shasta District Fair and Event Center in Anderson, firefighters wore black bands of mourning over their badges. Many of the firefighters eating breakfast after returning from 24-hour shifts either knew or knew someone who knew someone killed in the fires this year.\"It's very sobering,\" Captain Chris Auby of the Redwood City Fire Department said, \"and it makes you realize that this is a dangerous job and that there's a lot of risks.\"In the midst of weeks-long stretches of 24-hour shifts, firefighters don't have much time to reflect on the risks, or to grieve.In the meantime, firefighters are battling more than a dozen fires throughout the state with limited resources. Cal Fire had 3,388 first responders fighting the Carr Fire on Monday, with more crews on the way -- some coming from as far as Florida.The intense need for personnel has forced Cal Fire to rethink its typical strategies, said Alameda County Fire Captain Sam Lobese. Typically he responds to fires with a team of firefighters from his county. But on Sunday, he found himself working with people from St. Helena, Forestville and American Canyon.\"What's unique about what you see here -- they call it a rainbow strike team because we're from different counties,\" he said. \"And when you see that, that means things are stretched really thin in California. They're just trying to get rigs from any fire department, put them together, go. Homes are burning, go.\"That means everyone is working long, demanding shifts.Auby's day started at 5:30 a.m. Sunday, when he woke up in a trailer on the command center grounds. He and his crew headed up Quartz Hill Road in Redding to put out hot spots and prepare the neighborhood for residents to return. During the 24 hour shift, they took about three 30-minute breaks.\"It is tiring,\" he said. \"It's very exhausting.\"Auby, who lives in Danville, expects to be in the Redding area for two weeks -- but it could be longer. In the meantime his life and the lives of everyone on his team have been put on hold.That's been hard for Jeff Kirkish, also a Redwood City firefighter, who left his six-month-old babybehind in Aptos to fight the Carr Fire.As he put it, \"It's just tough.\"___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "303"}
{"content": "July 26--American Airlines passengers may find themselves fighting harder for overhead bin space this fall after the airline decided to allow carry-on bags for customers flying on basic economy tickets.Starting Sept. 5, passengers who book the cheaper, more restrictive fares will be able to fly with a personal item and carry-on bag, like regular coach flyers, the Fort Worth, Texas-based carrier said Thursday in a news release.Getting rid of the bag restrictions on shorter flights will make its basic economy fares more competitive with airlines that include a full-size carry-on in their cheapest fares, American said.Neither American nor Chicago-based United Airlines allowed basic economy flyers to bring carry-ons that had to be stored in overhead bins when they began selling the few-frills fares last year, though some frequent flyers and airline credit-card holders were exempt from the restrictions. Basic economy travelers who pay to check bags would quickly see those fees eat into savings on their fare.Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines, which already had its version of basic economy, was more generous, letting all coach passengers bring a carry-on and personal item.American's basic economy fares were generally still high enough that they weren't competing with true budget carries for the most price-conscious passengers, while travelers willing to pay a little more might have picked another carrier with fewer restrictions.\"If they really could get people to pay extra to avoid basic economy, that would be great, but the other side of it is how much business they lose as a result,\" said Ben Schlappig, author of the travel blog One Mile at a Time.Last year, United credited basic economy with reducing the number of carry-on bags checked at the gate when overhead bins fill up. But Schlappig said he'd also seen the limits on carry-on bags hold up boarding when basic economy flyers who said they were unaware of the rules argued about having to pay a fee to check their carry-on.\"I think it's great for consumers,\" Schlappig said of American's policy reversal. \"At least it's a nonpunitive option.\"American's policy change also brings rules for domestic basic economy passengers in line with those for customers flying between the U.S. and Europe. Travelers choosing the cheaper fares still can't choose a specific seat in advance for free and aren't eligible for upgrades.Both American and United began offering cheaper but more restrictive fares on some trans-Atlantic flights earlier this year, and both allow each passenger a personal item and larger carry-on. United described those new fares as a step toward an international version of basic economy.United didn't respond immediately Thursday to a request for comment on whether it is considering allowing basic economy passengers to fly with a carry-on bag.lzumbach@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "304"}

{"content": "There is still one unrestricted free agent forward that I would like to see the Toronto Maple Leafs pursue.Nick Shore is his name and he would be an excellent addition to the Toronto Maple Leafs in the role of fourth line centre or depth player.Currently the Leafs fourth line centre role could go to any number of players: Frederick Gauthier (or an actual goat), Per Lindholm, Adam Brooks, or Josh Jooris.  None of those guys really screams out for the job, but Per Linholdm is 26 and coming off a point-per-game season in the Swedish Elite League.  He may have the inside track, and he might even be better than Nick Shore.I\u2019ve never seen him play and I don`t have any advanced stats to go by, but Lindholm is a definite option. It wouldn\u2019t hurt to have a few options, however.Nick ShoreShore is 25 and spent most of his career with the Kings, but also played with the Senators and Flames last season. He has scored less than one point every four games throughout his career, so he`s not a scorer, and that is probably why he`s available.Over three seasons in LA, Shore was consistently a positive possession player relative to his team, and he is known for his excellent defense.Looking at the Leafs roster, you don`t see many defensively minded players. That is a good thing \u2013 the best defense is a great offense, but it wouldn\u2019t hurt to have a strong defender or two. The Leafs allowed way too many shots against last season and they also went through the season without a strong defensive centre. The best they could offer was the shadow of of Tomas Plecanek\u2019s former self and a very aged Dominic Moore.Shore brings something the team is clearly missing, and he could be signed cheaply since he currently is without an NHL job. The Toronto Maple Leafs made a similar move earlier when they signed Tyler Enis to a risk free deal with almost no cap hit. Or when they made this move of complete and baffling brilliance.  If they could pull off the same move with Shore they\u2019d have a nice back-up option if Per Lindholm can`t make the team, or in the case of injury.The Toronto Maple Leafs have only three spaces left on their 50 contract limit, but signing Nick Shore would be a good use of one of those slots. He is a solid NHL player that could be had for almost nothing and who can fill a role and a position that the Leafs are weak in.", "id": "306"}

However, it is noted that despite the wide use of disinfectants, cases of Enterococcus faecium infections have been increasing of late.According to a study that was recently published in the journal Science Translational Medicine, E. faecium has been growing increasingly tolerant of alcohol-based disinfectants. To get to this conclusion, researchers collected nearly 140 E. faecium isolates from hospitals between the years of 1997 and 2015 and tested to see the alcohol-tolerance of each one.10 Times More TolerantWhat they found was that the isolates from after 2010 were significantly more tolerant compared to their older counterparts. In fact, they found the newer isolates to be 10 times more tolerant of alcohol than the older samples, meaning that they are significantly less likely to be killed with the disinfectants. Further, a mouse gut colonization model even revealed that the alcohol-tolerant bacteria resisted the standard 70 percent isopropanol disinfection.\u201cThere are two things we are working on. One is understanding exactly how the bacteria are becoming more tolerant ... The second is what's going on in other parts of the world, and we are working with colleagues around the world to address that,\u201d said Tim Stinear of the University of Melbourne, co-author of the study.E. FaeciumEnterococcus faecium is actually a common gut bacteria but can cause serious illness when encountered at a hospital, with the illnesses ranging from urinary tract infections to bloodstream and surgical wound infections.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Enterococcus spp. are the fifth most common cause of health care-related infections They are becoming even more problematic by the fact that they are also becoming antibiotic-resistant, making them a major global public health issue.Keep Alcohol CloseDespite the results of the study, experts still urge the public to keep alcohol as an ally against germs and bacteria. While the results do show that it is possible for bacteria to become resistant to alcohol disinfectants, it\u2019s worth noting that the study deals specifically with one type of bacteria that has been responsible for increasing infections in hospitals and that the situation is different for everyday hand sanitizer use and the use of such products in health care facilities.In hospitals, it is vulnerable patients who are being exposed to such bacteria in a closed environment, whereas everyday users of hand sanitizers and alcohol use the disinfectants to kill germs and prevent foodborne illnesses.Simply put, the situation in hospitals is wildly different from that of everyday disinfectant use, and hand sanitizers remain to be an important part of keeping germs and illnesses at bay.", "id": "307"}
{"content": "Aug. 04--Urban Meyer and Zach Smith broke their silence Friday afternoon -- a college football giant and a fired assistant coach trying to restore their reputations.Meyer, who is on paid leave as Ohio State's head coach, said in a statement that he \"failed\" during interviews at Big Ten media days in Chicago when he claimed he had no knowledge of Smith's 2015 domestic-violence allegations.\"My intention was not to say anything inaccurate or misleading,\" Meyer said in the statement. \"However, I was not adequately prepared to discuss these sensitive personnel issues with the media, and I apologize for the way I handled those questions.\"More important, Meyer insisted he \"followed proper reporting protocols and procedures\" regarding the 2015 incident and made it clear he will not resign from Ohio State, where he is 73-8 over six seasons with a national title and two Big Ten championships.\"I ask that you continue to support the incredible coaches and student-athletes in our program, and I look forward to rejoining them soon,\" Meyer said in the statement addressed to \"Buckeye Nation.\"Smith, meanwhile, in an interview with ESPN denied committing acts of domestic violence against then-wife Courtney, even though an extensive report by veteran college football reporter Brett McMurphy included seemingly damning photos and text messages between Courtney Smith and Shelley Meyer, Urban's wife.Zach Smith -- whom Meyer fired July 23 as his wide receivers coach after a charge in May of criminal trespassing for driving to his ex-wife's residence -- told ESPN that athletic director Gene Smith called him to campus in 2015 after Courtney Smith said she had been assaulted by her husband.Zach Smith said Urban Meyer confronted him, saying, \"What the hell's going on? What is this?\"Smith said he told Meyer: \"Apparently my ex-wife is trying to get me charged with domestic abuse from incidents that happened years ago and some more recent. (Meyer) looked at me (and said), 'If you hit her, you're fired immediately.'\"I said, 'Coach, if I hit her, I wouldn't even come to work. I would know it was over.' \"Regarding the photos that show bruises and blood on Courtney Smith, Zach Smith said Friday during an interview on Columbus, Ohio, radio station WXZX: \"I'm not discounting that (they are authentic). I don't know where or what they are from. I have no idea. There were several times things got out of hand between us, and I may have restrained her to get out of the house.\"Courtney Smith told McMurphy: \"He took me and shoved me up against the wall, with his hands around my neck -- something he did very often. My (then-3-year-old) daughter was clinging to my leg. It obviously registered with him what he was doing, so he took my (then-5-year-old) son and left. So I called the police.\"Regarding Meyer's statement, Sports Illustrated legal analyst Michael McCann tweeted: \"Urban Meyer's statement seems written with contract law in mind. It denies any grounds that Ohio State could use to fire him with cause. At the same time, it acknowledges his answers to journalists' questions were inadequate -- a personal failing that doesn't violate his contract.\"tgreenstein@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "308"}

The Dolphins defeated the Vikings 30-9. (Photo by Hannah Foslien/Getty Images)There are sure to be at least a few surprises to come out of training camp. It looks like one is already emerging at Dolphins camp and it\u2019s a pleasant one.Through three days of Miami Dolphins 2018 training camp, we have been closely following a few position battles. One of the closest followed and most important is the starting cornerback job opposite Xavien Howard. This battle is particularly important because, if you don\u2019t win this job, you likely fall almost right out of the rotation since Bobby McCain is locked into the nickel corner slot with Minkah Fitzpatrick most likely the next guy up in the slot.The battle seemed to be between second year man Cordrea Tankersley and the returning Tony Lippett off a lost season due to injury. We now have a new participant making waves in this battle.2017 undrafted free agent Torry McTyer has entered the mix after a hot start at camp. It\u2019s fair to say almost nobody saw this coming, at least not from the outside looking in. We did see him get on the field last season, but there was nothing particularly memorable about his limited opportunities.However, he worked tirelessly this offseason and packed on eight pounds of muscle. When you combine his bulked up frame with his 4.3-second 40-yard dash speed, the Dolphins may really have something here.Head coach Adam Gase has taken notice to McTyer\u2019s development as he was given first-team reps on Day 3 of training camp Saturday. He has impressed with tight coverage, rare speed and outstanding anticipation leading to big plays on defense. No one is going as far to say that he is going to win this job over Lippett and Tankersley or that he is even close to being a favorite. Nevertheless, he has turned heads and almost certainly earned himself a spot on the 53-man roster.", "id": "309"}
{"content": "July 27--Triple-digit temperatures and super-concentrated heat -- not heavy winds -- are spinning funnels of fire that have twice erupted in the dangerous Carr Fire, tormenting the city of Redding in Northern California as firefighters contend with a rare meteorological foe.Witnesses likened one Thursday night to a tornado. Another ominous fire cloud Friday reached nearly five miles high, so tall it cast a shadow and caused wind gusts of 50 mph.This unusual weather phenomenon, called a \"fire vortex,\" is creating dangerously erratic conditions, complicating efforts to contain the steadily growing Carr Fire in Shasta County, said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California at Los Angeles.\"This giant rotating cylinder on top of the fire, composed of smoke, pulls burning embers and smoldering debris thousands of feet into the atmosphere,\" he said.It allows fire to jump over barriers, such as roads, rivers and bulldozed firebreaks, he said. \"It causes it to do crazy, very unpredictable things.\"What's behind the phenomenon?The Redding fire is not driven by stiff winds, as witnessed in Santa Rosa, the Oakland hills and other fatal California wildfires, he said. Instead, the fire created its own heat source, aided by an afternoon sun that baked the ground with air temperatures to 113 degrees.As super-hot smoke ascends, it creates a wicked updraft -- so strong it begins to rotate.\"It rises, stretches and spins, like a ballerina,\" Swain said.Incredible video captured by bystanders show an enormous tendril-like plume whirling near Redding, spewing smoke and poisonous carbon monoxide gas into the air.Most \"fire whirls\" are small and brief spin-ups that occur almost continuously on the margins of major fires.But the Carr Fire fire-induced vortex was unusually deep and tall, according to scientists.\"Full-on rotating convective column. Scary as hell,\" tweeted Neil Lareau, assistant professor of atmospheric science at the University of Nevada at Reno.It was so powerful that three high-voltage transmission towers were melted and blown over, according to journalist Damon Arthur of the Redding-based Record Searchlight newspaper. He witnessed mature trees that escaped the flames -- but were uprooted and stripped of all leaves.\"The Carr Fire is unprecedented in that strong winds were not driving the fire, but rather the plume rotated and intensified creating its own weather. For a fire to burn into Redding like that is very unique,\" said professor Craig Clements, Director of the Fire Weather Research Lab at San Jose State University. \"Hot temperatures, dry air, and critical fuel conditions. The fire danger today is extreme for Northern California.\"Last October's catastrophic fire in Santa Rosa was ignited by downed power lines and fierce wind gusts. The 1991 Oakland Hills fire was driven by hot, dry Diablo winds up to 65 mph, which ignited stands of eucalyptus and dead Monterey pines. The December 2017 Thomas Fire in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties was propelled by unusually strong and persistent Santa Ana winds, causing it to jump from ridge to ridge.In Redding, the winds were essentially dead calm, said Swain. But temperatures reached the triple digits, peaking at 113.\"It really did create its own weather system over the city of Redding,\" he said.Similar columns of fast, rising hot air are often seen over the Sierra in the summer, resulting in bubbly cumulus clouds. That's because those mountain peaks act as a heat source, warming the local atmosphere. The heat causes little pieces of the atmosphere to rise, condensing and forming clouds -- even triggering thunderstorms.While rare, it is not unknown to firefighters. One of California's most famed \"fire tornadoes\" occurred in 1926, when lightning struck large oil tanks near San Luis Obispo. Thousands of whirls were formed, lofting one house into the air for 150 feet, killing two occupants.But they are difficult to predict, said Swain.\"California's fire-fighting agencies are second to none,\" with strong connections to the meterologic community, he said. \"They were well aware of the potential for this to happen.\"\"In this instance, it all came together,\" he said, \"at the worst time and worst possible place.\"___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "310"}
{"content": "Until there's a clear winner in the trade war with China, Jim Cramer told his Mad Money viewers, investors should expect a lot more volatility in the stock market. The forecast, he said, is still likely to be delicious gains followed by maximum pain. It's clear that President Trump is willing to sacrifice some of our best industrial companies, at least over the short term, in the name of fair trade, Cramer said. With the Chinese economy showing signs of slowing, Trump may be willing to increase the stakes even more for maximum pressure. What would a win on trade look like? Cramer said allowing U.S. companies to operate in China without the need for a joint partnership that steals our trade secrets would be a good start. With the industrial stocks in limbo, the market turned to Apple (AAPL) , an Action Alerts PLUS holding, for leadership. Cramer said while Apple marches towards a $1 trillion valuation, the stock offers little pin action for the rest of tech. While problems at Facebook (FB) may have implications for the rest of the industry, what's good for Apple is largely just good for Apple. But that doesn't mean there aren't buying opportunities out there. The banks are a superb investment with more interest rate hikes on the horizon, as are the retailers going into the back to school shopping season. Investors who can't handle the volatility should consider investing in index funds, Cramer added, because once the trade wars are over, the entire market will see a terrific bounce to the upside. What Consumers Really Want  What lessons could Procter &amp; Gamble (PG) learn from Apple? Both companies reported earnings yesterday, and Cramer said the differences between the two were stunning. Cramer has long said that Apple is not a technology company, but rather a consumer goods maker, just like Procter. But while Procter struggles with changing consumer behaviors and declining customer loyalty, Apple is the exact opposite, with a 98% customer satisfaction rating on its latest iPhone and a services stream with accelerating growth. Organic growth is the truest metric by which to value consumer stocks, Cramer explained, but while Procter delivered just 1% organic growth, Apple's remains in the double digits. Yet despite the disparity, shares of Procter trade at 17 times earnings while Apple remains at just 15 times earnings, and that's before factoring in the company's massive cash hoard.

One of the greatest feats in the history of publishing, \"The Iliad\" and \"The Odyssey\" of young adult literature, the book that gave voice and solace to generations of adolescent girls the whole world over ... on the big screen.Maybe.On Thursday night, author/legend/hero/goddess Judy Blume (Margaret's maker, if you didn't know) tweeted to her 552,000 followers: \"So which of my books, kids and/or adult would you want to see adapted for series or movie? I ask because I'm in LA meeting with many talented people. I think the time has come.\"The correct reply, obviously, is \"all of them.\" Plenty of her followers said as much.The second best reply is \"Are You There God? It's Me Margaret,\" Blume's 1970 story about a sixth-grade girl who struggles to fit in her new town without friends or a religion -- everyone hangs out either at the Jewish Community Center or the YMCA, and her Catholic-raised mom and Jewish-raised dad swore off organized religion years ago.Margaret tackles training bras, kissing, periods, middle school rumor mills, spirituality and friendship in a way that still, some four decades later, feels honest and true.By Friday morning, more than 1,000 replies had rolled in. \"Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing\" popped up multiple times. \"Deenie\" made a few appearances. \"Summer Sisters\" came up a lot. All of the \"Fudge\" books as a Netflix miniseries was proposed.\"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret\" is clearly a fan favorite, though. A sampling of replies:\"I love them all, but Are You there God ... would be amazing.\"\"Another vote for Margaret!!! Please please please!!!\"\"Don't make me choose!!! (but Are You There God? would be first choice)\"My favorite reply came with specific instructions: \"Summer Sisters as a miniseries, Are You There God It's Me Margaret as a TV show. No updating either. I want them set in the time they were originally written in -- Margaret has to use those period belts or I will riot.\"I had the great good fortune of interviewing Blume in 2015 at the Chicago Humanities Festival. \"In the Unlikely Event,\" her novel based on the real events surrounding a string of plane crashes in the early 1950s, had just been released, and we talked about it (among other topics) in front of a sold-out auditorium at Francis W. Parker.I can only describe the energy in the room that night as kinetic. Hundreds upon hundreds of women wearing \"I (heart) Judy\" pins. Screams of delight when she walked on stage. An hourslong line to have books signed afterward.And I can only imagine movie theaters would buzz with that same energy if women had the chance to grab their friends, their moms, their daughters, their sisters, to watch Margaret writ large.Are you there, God? It's us, Judy Blume's fans.

When the Cleveland Browns have better players and a better coaching staff, you know your team messed up.Andy Dalton, the former TCU quarterback, current Bengals quarterback does little to cause opposing teams to fear the Bengals. Dalton is known as a limited passer that struggles to have back-to-back great performances together. Last season, Dalton failed to reach the 60 percent completion percentage that most people believe to be a requirement to run an NFL offense.For offensive skill players, the Bengals have wide receivers John Ross and superstar receiver A.J. Green. However, because of the talent playing quarterback, Cincinnati\u2019s receivers are not able to play up to their potential.The Bengals have a stable of running backs but none of them are of the caliber of Ezekiel Elliott, Todd Gurley, or Tevin Coleman. Joe Mixon, the second year back from Oklahoma looks like the player to have the best chance at reaching a 1000 rushing yards.Defensively, this Bengals team is old along the defensive line and is not athletically elite at the linebacker position.

{"content": "The HP bug bounty program, the first of its kind in the printer industry, is offering as much as $10,000. Hackers who sign up look for software vulnerabilities, which attackers may use to infiltrate wider networks. ( HP )HP launched a bug bounty program that is offering a reward of as much as $10,000 to hackers who can discover security vulnerabilities in its printers.Bug bounty programs are certainly nothing new, as various technology companies such as Google and Nintendo have offered rewards for reporting Android exploits and Nintendo Switch hacks. However, HP is the first company in the printer industry to launch one.HP Bug Bounty ProgramThe HP bug bounty program is offering as much as $10,000 to hackers who will be able to find vulnerabilities in the company's printers.The program was actually quietly started in May, with a total of 34 researchers having signed up for it. It is already paying dividends for both HP and the researchers, as a $10,000 bounty has already been paid out to a hacker who discovered a serious flaw. HP is able to fix the problem before it is widely exploited by attackers, and the researcher pocketed a cool amount of cash for reporting it.The HP bug bounty program comes at a time when attackers are becoming more aggressive. With printers connected to wider network systems, it is increasingly important for HP to patch up vulnerabilities before hackers take advantage of the computer accessories.HP simply does not want one of its printers being the cause of an attack against a company, and the bug bounty program is looking to avoid such a disaster.Printer Security RiskTom's Hardware said that according to a recent Bugcrowd report, hackers have increased their focus on targeting endpoint devices, such as printer, over the previous year. Over that time, the vulnerabilities discovered in printer software have increased by 21 percent, showing the higher risk of owning printers, especially in business environments.Printers have not been considered as major security threats. However, as hackers keep looking for ways to infiltrate otherwise secure networks, unpatched printers are becoming a possible entry point.\"As we navigate an increasingly complex world of cyber threats, it's paramount that industry leaders leverage every resource possible to deliver trusted, resilient security from the firmware up. HP is committed to engineering the most secure printers in the world,\" said HP Chief Technologist of Print Security Shivaun Albright.Hacking HP printers for the bug bounty program will be kept private for now, as the company wants to see how things go first before opening it to the public. HP may also be trying to delay the disclosure of any vulnerability that researchers involved in the program discover, as some enterprises are slow to installing updates for their networks and devices.", "id": "318"}
{"content": "July 30--\"Safe Houses\" by Dan Fesperman, Knopf, 416 pages, $26.95In Baltimore-based spy master Dan Fesperman's latest, the past eerily overlaps with the present via two artfully linked stories.In 1989, Helen Abell, a lowly 23-year-old CIA worker stationed in Berlin, witnesses a high-ranking agent sexually abuse a woman in a safe house and comes out of hiding to stop the attack. Though warned by her superiors to back off the case, Abell becomes determined to make the agent pay for what she learns is only the latest in a series of such assaults. She goes rogue from the Company and the compromised CIA operative with whom she was having an affair.Twenty-five years later, while living in a farmhouse on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, she and her husband are shotgunned to death. The murder is pinned on their mentally challenged 24-year-old son, Willard, but his older sister Anna knows he never could have committed such an act. She hires an investigator to help her uncover the truth, not knowing anything about her secretive mother's past.Like the best espionage novels, \"Safe Houses\" brilliantly traces the distance between high moral ground and low. Part of the fun of the book is reading it for a second time and seeing how the narrative seeds of the first part enrich and deepen what occurs in part two.\"The Throwaway\" by Michael Moreci, Forge, 318 pages, $25.99Best known for his comic books and sci-fi fiction (\"Black Star Renegades\"), Chicagoan Michael Moreci makes a serious foray into espionage fiction with this brisk and timely thriller.His odd man out is Mark Strain, a sometimes shady Washington lobbyist whose happy future with his pregnant wife, Sarah, is upended when federal agents invade their bedroom, accuse him of being a Russian spy and hand him over to Russian intelligence -- supposedly as part of a prisoner exchange. This comes after a done-deal with a client of Strain's to provide the Pentagon with its security software is unexpectedly scotched. What cutthroat sold him out? What state secrets are so at risk that he is expendable? He has plenty of questions that need answering after he escapes the clutches of the Russians and fights his way back to Washington.\"The Throwaway\" boasts a wide assortment of cliches and stock characters, and Strain pulls off at least one unlikely \"Mission: Impossible\"-type scheme. But Moreci is good at action scenes, a friendly female double agent livens things up, and you can bet the Russkies are going to go after Sarah after losing their man. Moreci's unassuming style also pays dividends: This is that rare contemporary thriller that is happy to treat the reader to a clean, linear narrative -- no parallel plots or time jumps to slow things down.\"Rip the Angels From Heaven\" by David Krugler, Pegasus, 336 pages, $25.95The year is 1945. Rarely has a double agent been in more over his head than naval intelligence man (and Chicago native) Ellis Voigt. He is being targeted not only by the Russians he has infiltrated -- they suspect he had something to do with the disappearance of the head of their Washington spy ring -- but by the FBI, which thinks he's a Commie who murdered a Navy officer.At the heart of the plot is the passing of crucial intel about the atomic research going on in New Mexico. As in \"The Throwaway,\" the hero hooks up with an attractive female playing both sides of the street. Before luring the Russians into a disinformation scheme in Los Alamos (where Richard Feynman makes a guest appearance), he must endure a grueling torture session you may want to skip past. He also is tormented by his failure to save a young boy from getting shot.\"Rip the Angels From Heaven\" has its own cliche problems, not to mention unfortunate lines such as, \"My mind raced as I tried to keep my composure.\" But author David Krugler, who acquired his doctorate at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, is terrific at period details and atmosphere, and makes a complicated plot tick -- and go off.Lloyd Sachs, a freelancer, writes regularly about crime fiction for the Tribune.___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "319"}

As The Verge notes, it appears Chrome is slowly turning into the next Internet Explorer 6 \u2014 with developers primarily favoring Chrome then working on rival browsers later.Not only does YouTube load slowly when using other browsers, but the experience can often be far from pleasant as well. For example, when visiting YouTube, it keeps pestering users to download and install Chrome with various pop-up notifications. When users do install Chrome, they find that YouTube loads much faster, causing those unaware to think that perhaps Edge, Firefox, and Safari are just bad browsers.As to why Google is doing this, Peterson wrote:\"I assume Google has metrics showing that the Polymer redesign increases Firefox and Edge user engagement more than the slow polyfills hurt it.\" Interestingly, \"YouTube still serves the pre-Polymer design to [Internet Explorer 11] by default so they could choose to serve it to Firefox and Edge too.\"How To Fix The 'YouTube Is Slow On My Browser' ProblemFortunately, there are workarounds to this problem, and they're pretty easy to do. Check out the instructions below.\u2022 For Edge Users: Edge users need to download Tampermonkey from the Microsoft Store. Afterward, go to Settings, find the \"extensions within edge\" option, and enable Tampermonkey. Download this script to force YouTube to the classic mode.\u2022 For Safari Users: Similarly, Safari users must download the Safari version of Tampermonkey. Click \"Trust\" when the browser brings up an installation prompt. Then, download the same script linked above to force YouTube to the classic mode.\u2022 For Firefox Users: Firefox users only need to download this YouTube Classic extension to force the site to load properly.", "id": "320"}
{"content": "The idea of brain-training apps able to improve our cognitive abilities by playing games seemed like the perfect middle finger to everyone who ever told us to stop playing Sega and get on with some homework. Sadly, a new piece of research suggests that maybe we should have listened to our parents after all. According to a recent study from neuroscientists at Canada\u2019s Western University, brain-training apps are great at \u2026 making you good at playing that particular brain-training app.The researchers in the study examined whether playing one brain-training app for a period of several hours would make someone good at another brain-training app, utilizing the same part of the brain. Should this be the case, they theorized it would show that such apps can indeed improve a person\u2019s working memory, which is crucial for countering memory loss and helping us better retain information.This isn\u2019t what they found, though. Instead, high scores racked up in the first game had no impact whatsoever on performance in the second game. In fact, scores were pretty much identical to those attained by a control group who hadn\u2019t had the benefit of training on the first app.\u201cWe hypothesized that if you get really, really good at one test by training for a very long time, maybe then you\u2019ll get improvement on tests that are quite similar,\u201d Bobby Stojanoski, a research scientist in the Owen Lab at Western\u2019s Brain and Mind Institute and lead author of the paper, said in a statement. \u201cUnfortunately, we found no evidence to support that claim. Despite hours of brain training on that one game, participants were no better at the second game than people who tested on the second game, but hadn\u2019t trained on the first one.\u201dThis doesn\u2019t conclusively prove brain-training apps are useless, of course. It doesn\u2019t act as a qualitative study of all brain-training apps, for one thing. It would also be interesting to see a follow-up which examines whether these apps could play a role in stopping the decline of neural function in older groups of people, similar to how people report doing crosswords or sudokus to keep their mind active.For most of us, though, it seems that *sigh* we\u2019re better off eating healthier, exercising regularly, and doing our homework on time in order to really train our brains.", "id": "321"}
{"content": "Aug. 02--CUPERTINO -- Apple first reached its trillion-dollar market capitalization when its share price topped $207.05 shortly before 9 a.m. PDT Thursday. Analysts calculated Apple's market capitalization by multiplying the share price with the outstanding share count -- or how many shares are currently in the market.Apple shares later surged above the $207.05 share price that put its market value at the $1 trillion level, given the company's new outstanding share count released Wednesday.Apple's outstanding share count was at 4,829,926,000 as of July 20, according to the company's 10-Q filing to the Securities and Exchanges Commission on Wednesday.By around 11:08 a.m. PDT, Apple shares traded at $208.14, up about 3.3 percent on the day.The milestone is the culmination of Apple's persistent growth and continued delivery of products that at times have been revolutionary and other times evolutionary, but nevertheless popular worldwide with consumers. From the early days of the Macintosh computer in the 1980s to later, more portable innovations such as the iPod, iPad, iPhone and Apple Watch -- offering platforms for app-based services -- Apple's products and vision have lifted the company to new heights for a U.S. public company.Experts pointed to the leadership shown by Apple's late co-founder Steve Jobs and current CEO Tim Cook as pivotal to the company's enduring success.\"Symbolically, it's an important milestone which speaks to how transformational, successful and unparalleled the Apple ecosystem is that Jobs and Cook have created in succession,\" said Dan Ives, GBH Insights' head of technology research. \"It just speaks to how revolutionary the iPhone's been.\"While Wall Street and the world watched for Apple to reach the $1 trillion market capitalization early Thursday, the company apparently managed to get a little ahead of itself in marking the milestone. Apple's own Stocks app inadvertently reported Apple hitting a $1 trillion market cap before its shares actually reached the $207.05 level that made that historic market value a reality. The cause of the glitch reportedly was that the app didn't reflect the latest company filing showing that Apple had bought back more of its shares, which meant its stock price had to hit a higher share-price threshold than was necessary under the previously reported count of outstanding shares. Apple's Stocks app, which is built in to the company's iPhones, reportedly pulls data from Yahoo Finance as its source of stock price information.Although Apple did get to the $1 trillion market value soon afterward, it wasn't the first corporation worldwide to reach that market capitalization. Chinese oil giant PetroChina Co. did it first in 2007. But PetroChina's trillion-dollar market capitalization was short-lived, and it's now trading at a market value of around $214 billion, Forbes reported Wednesday.Unlike PetroChina's speculative explosion that propelled the oil company to the trillion-dollar pinnacle, Apple's climb has been a slow, steady advance built on consecutive quarters of solid growth. The final push followed Apple's strong fiscal third-quarter earnings and good revenue guidance for the fourth quarter on Tuesday.Apple has paved the way for other technology companies, like Amazon, to reach the summit, according to analysts.\"Silicon Valley wouldn't be what it is today without Apple,\" said Ives. Ives also forecast Amazon -- currently still shy of a $900 billion market cap -- could join Apple in the trillion-dollar club in 2019.After its $38 billion one-time tax payment to the United States government in January under the new tax reform, Apple announced a $100 billion stock buyback plan to reduce the share count in the market.Cupertino-based Apple reported Tuesday that sales of its iPhones only increased 1 percent in its fiscal third quarter from the same period a year earlier, but because of the popularity of its pricier smartphone models like iPhone X driving sales, total revenue from iPhone sales jumped 20 percent from the same period a year ago.As iPhone revenues continued to jump, Apple's most lucrative revenue growth came from services like Apple Music and Apple Pay and wearables like AirPod earphones and Apple Watch.\"They extracted more revenue and more profit from the most incentivized customers in the market,\" said KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Andy Hargreaves. \"As for the wearables, after early stumbles and not knowing quite what to do, Apple hit its stride. They added increments of growth surrounding the iPhone.\"However, geopolitical risks in the near term have the potential to derail some of Apple's momentum. A looming trade war between the United States and China could possibly result in China slapping tariffs onto Apple products such as the Apple Watch.In a conference call with analysts Tuesday, Cook said he hoped that \"calm heads will prevail\" in both Washington and Beijing.Depending upon how it unfolds, the China-U.S. trade dispute could be particularly painful for Apple as mainland China remains a huge consumer base and the hub of most of its manufacturing, Hargreaves said.But Creative Strategies' consumer technology analyst Carolina Milanesi said the \"impact of new tariffs on phones has been short-lived\" in the past.\"My proof points are South Korea and their increase in tax of a few years ago and Russia, where there was a crackdown on import duties between 2010 and 2012,\" said Milanesi. \"In both occasions, prices grew, and the market slowed down for a few quarters before picking back up.\"Analysts suggested Apple's new U.S. market cap record will have almost no impact on the company's day-to-day operations or its consumers. Furthermore, they said they don't expect the milestone to galvanize investors to sell or buy more Apple shares.\"From a day-to-day perspective I am sure it is business as usual (for Apple),\" said Milanesi. \"Does it matter for Apple? Sure, it proves that investors believe in the path they are on, especially given some of the bets they made with iPhone X pricing and the focus on services.\"But analysts noted that Apple reaching the trillion-dollar market capitalization does have some significance.\"I'd be a fool to say there is literally no importance to it,\" said Hargreaves. \"It is a notable moment. It just doesn't mean much in a practical sense. Like, is turning 50 (years old) any different than turning 49?\"Staff reporter Rex Crum contributed to this article.___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "322"}
{"content": "July 27--SAN FRANCISCO -- Hader stole headlines during the All-Star Game last week when racist and homophobic tweets that he sent out as a 17-year old surfaced during the Midsummer Classic. On Thursday, he pitched on the road for the first time since the controversy ignited, taking the mound in a city that's known for being the birthplace of the gay rights movement and a bastion of liberal thought.The Brewers reliever received a round of scattered boos as he replaced starter Wade Miley with two outs in the sixth. But the response was relatively mild considering that he warmed up in the bullpen along the right field line guarded by a police officer and a security guard.Before the game, Hader insisted that he wasn't worried about getting heckled by the Giants faithful or liberal activists in attendance.\"Obviously, I've made mistakes,\" Hader said. \"But hopefully, these fans will get a chance to know who I really am and not be judgmental about my past mistakes.\"After the All-Star game, Hader, 24, apologized to his teammates and expressed regret during a news conference, insisting the seven-year old tweets aren't reflective of the person he is today. When he took the mound at Miller Park Saturday, he received a standing ovation from Brewers fans, the type of reaction typically reserved for no hitters, milestones and farewell tours.The response will be much different as he makes his way around the Majors, pitching in hostile environments, such as Wrigley Field in Chicago and Citi Field in New York.Hader, who's entered the game with a 1.43 ERA and a 0.79 WHIP in 33 appearances, insisted that he'd be ready for whatever Giants fans threw his way. He backed up his words, inducing a ground out to end a Giants rally in the sixth before tossing a hitless seventh with two strikeouts.\"I'm not really expecting anything,\" Hader said Thursday afternoon. \"Whatever they want to say to me, if it's good or bad, I'm ready for anything.\"I really don't know how they will react. I'm here to do my job and not let any distractions get to me, whether it's my past mistakes or the crowd.\"___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "323"}

{"content": "The 2018 NFL season will arrive much faster than people realize. Not only that, but it will carry its fair share of surprises by the time it does.People always tend to underestimate how big of an impact training camps and preseason can have on the outlook of an NFL roster. Players who might\u2019ve been considered a third-stringer or backup can suddenly thrust themselves into a starting job if things go right. Players written off as lost causes regain their footing and rebound in a big way. This is what can make pro football so intoxicating at times. It\u2019s so unpredictable.Most camps are barely a week old and already some fascinating nuggets have surfaced. Ones that lead to the belief some unexpected events will transpire by the time opening day arrives this coming September. So here are five early predictions based on what\u2019s been heard thus far.Teddy Bridgewater steals the Jets starting QB jobThe euphoria of the draft is fading away. Sam Darnold is expected to become the franchise guy for the New York Jets but that\u2019s kind of hard to do when you haven\u2019t even signed a contract yet. Darnold is one of just two 1st round picks who remain unsigned and each passing day he\u2019s away from camp, he\u2019s losing ground in the bid to win the starting job.This is especially misguided since he\u2019s going against Teddy Bridgewater, a former Pro Bowler who signed with the team back in March. Whispers out of camp are the coaches and several teammates are already taken by him. His natural leadership and work ethic are shining brightly. So much that it\u2019s not hard to imagine him being the starter opening day.", "id": "325"}
{"content": "July 25--President Donald Trump's \"Buy American and Hire American\" executive order last year appears to have led federal immigration officials to deny more requests for the controversial H-1B visa, according to a new report.The H-1B, intended for highly skilled foreign workers and heavily used by Silicon Valley's technology industry, has become a flashpoint in the debate over immigration, with critics pointing to reported abuses and claiming holders of the visa take jobs from Americans.Now, the non-profit research institute National Foundation for American Policy is reporting that denial rates for the H-1B shot up significantly toward the end of last year. And this year, officials were continuing to nix applications for skills-based visas at a high rate, the institute reported. It said the upswing in denials was \"likely due to new Trump administration policies.\"The H-1B denial rate jumped to 22 percent in the last quarter of the last fiscal year, from 16 percent in the third quarter, a 41 percent increase, according to the institute, which said its findings were based on data from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration. The institute also said its conclusion that denial rates for skills-based visas were high so far this year was based on interviews with lawyers and companies, plus other data.Denials of H-1B applications started to rise soon after President Donald Trump issued the \"Buy American and Hire American\" executive order in April 2017, the institute said.Trump's order said the U.S. will \"rigorously enforce and administer the laws governing entry into the United States of workers from abroad.\"Data suggest H-1B denials rose as Trump administration political appointees began guiding the decisions of visa adjudicators at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration, according to the institute.___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "326"}

{"content": "July 27--Uber and Lyft have long advertised their ride-hailing services as deterrents from traffic congestion in dense cities. But a new study found the services -- even their shared rides -- leading to at least a 160 percent increase of cars driving on urban streets.The study from New York City-based firm Schaller Consulting examined published reports, news articles, a national travel survey and trip data from the past 18 months to deliver a report on the impact of transportation network companies -- better known as ride-hail or ride share, such as Uber and Lyft.The study published Wednesday concluded that without wide-reaching public policy regulations, \"big American cities are likely to be overwhelmed with more automobility, more traffic and less transit.\" And once ride share enters the self-driving arena, the study forecasts, these cities will grow even more overwhelmed in the future.\"Tech companies, automakers and others are currently racing toward an autonomous future that envisions shared, door-to-door ride services weaning people from personal autos and combining the convenience of TNCs with the space efficiency of shared trips,\" reads the report. \"Today's TNC experience, however, calls into question theviability of the door-to-door shared service model.\"Uber and Lyft, in statements to this news organization, pushed back on the study, saying it was \"fundamentally flawed.\" Lyft spokesperson Campbell Matthews called Bruce Schaller, the study's author, a \"known taxicab consultant,\" who works in an industry most adversely affected by the advent of ride-hailing companies. Schaller previously worked for New York City's Department of Transportation and the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission.Matthews pointed to various studies contradicting Schaller's findings. One was from the public-interest organization Shared-Use Mobility Center, which earlier this year found \"no clear relationship between the level of rush-hour TNC use and longer-term changes in public transit usage.\"\"These studies also show that Lyft users are more likely to use public transportation, not less,\" Matthews said.Uber spokesperson Matthew Wing said the company \"wholeheartedly agree with several of Mr. Schaller's proposed public policies,\" but said the study ignored important facets, such as the mobility benefits ride shares provide to low income groups in traditionally underserved neighborhoodsFor years, Uber, Lyft and other companies argued their services -- particularly shared rides -- can drastically help reduce traffic in urban cities. In a 2017 online essay titled \"The End of Traffic\", Lyft co-founders John Zimmer and Logan Green argue that if all New York City single-occupancy taxi rides were replaced with Lyft Line shared rides, it would cut 75 percent of vehicles off the road.Reducing the number of cars in urban centers, the study went on to say, is the only way to reduce traffic congestion. The study proposed limiting parking supply and limiting or banning low-occupancy vehicles from certain streets; mandating TNCs meet certain occupancy levels or time with passengers during trips to increase efficiency; and provide frequent bus service and rail service wherever available.\"The overall vision is thus for less traffic and greater ease of movement for everyone regardless of mode for a given trip,\" reads the report.For shared rides in nine of the densest metropolitan areas in the United States, TNCs added 2.6 new miles of traffic for every 1 mile it took off from personal cars -- a 160 percent increase. Private rides were slightly worse for traffic, as TNCs added 2.8 new miles of traffic.The study argues lofty goals set by TNCs to increase share rides won't reduce traffic. For example, Lyft will add 2.2 new miles of traffic, even if it met its goal of share rides composing at least 50 percent of all Lyft rides by 2022.New traffic miles are added as most users switch from non-auto modes of transportation, such as public transportation, walking and bicycling, to use TNCs and drivers often face long distances to reach their pick-up location, according to the study. And even at times, shared rides involve just one passenger, inflating the mileage.TNCs continue to grow in popularity in the United States. TNCs transported 2.61 billion passengers in 2017, a 37 percent increase from 1.90 billion a year prior, according to the study. And 70 percent of Uber and Lyft trips occurred in nine metropolitan areas, including San Francisco.Despite the growth of TNC riderships, the demographics of riders remain limited, according to the study. People living in or nearby city centers, aged between 25 and 34, college-educated and making more than $50,000 used TNCs at least twice as much as their less wealthy, suburban and older counterparts.___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "328"}
{"content": "July 25--City Inspector General Joe Ferguson Wednesday said he favors requiring Chicago police to document incidents in which an officer points a gun at a person.Whether they should have to is the lone sticking point in negotiations between the city and the state attorney general's office over a proposed court agreement intended to govern reforms in the Chicago Police Department.Ferguson said Wednesday he had a gun pulled on him by a robber who stuck up a gas station where he worked as a youth -- and then had police pull their weapons on him minutes later when they responded and thought he might have been the culprit. He contended it's a life-altering experience.\"It is a fundamentally perspective-changing event,\" he said. \"And so, it's a really important thing to fold into how it is that we monitor use of force.\"Ferguson was appointed by Emanuel to the police accountability task force the mayor created in late 2015 to recommend ways to improve oversight of the Police Department in the wake of the release of video of the police shooting of black teen Laquan McDonald.Ferguson is not involved in negotiating the consent decree, and said he isn't sure who is taking which position regarding the possibility of the data being kept on officers pulling their guns. Attorney General Lisa Madigan's office said Friday the sides reached consensus on most of a draft consent decree spanning more than 200 pages that covers topics including use of force, training, supervision and officer accountability.Officials in Madigan's office have said they want the incidents documented.Lawyers for Madigan and City Hall were back in court Wednesday but said they had not broken their impasse over the issue. The attorneys indicated they plan to litigate it while moving ahead with the rest of the consent decree.The Chicago Fraternal Order of Police, whose leaders want the litigation over the consent decree dismissed, is seeking to intervene in the case, though the judge has not ruled on whether the union can be involved. The union's attorney, Joel D'Alba, said in court that the issue of documenting the pointing of guns is \"very critical to the safety of officers.\" He voiced concern that forcing the department to document the incidents would cause officers to second-guess themselves.The parties are scheduled to be back in court Aug. 6.Ferguson said police officers shouldn't oppose the clause, since if they are behaving properly and following department protocols when they pull their guns, the data wouldn't be held against them. The forthcoming draft represents a starting point for a potentially divisive battle over the details of an eventual court agreement.Efforts to hammer out a court order are poised to take place in the last months of Emanuel's campaign for re-election. The mayor faces multiple challengers who could use his efforts at police reform to cast him as either unconcerned about police abuse or too eager to restrain police in a city plagued by violent crime.jebyrne@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "329"}
{"content": "The Toronto Maple Leafs could make the best power play the NHL has ever seen.Last season the Toronto Maple Leafs were second in the NHL with a PP% of 25.0. This season they have the opportunity to make a power play that can dominate any team at even strength.With the likes of Auston Matthews and John Tavares on their roster, the Leafs have one of the best offensive cores in the NHL. This will translate well when they are on the man advantage.Toronto can go two ways with their power play. They can either make one unit (like the Pittsburgh Penguins) that has their best players on the ice for just about the full two minutes. By the way, Pittsburgh led the NHL with a PP% of 26.2 so they are clearly on to something. The other strategy is to make two equally dominating power plays. Separate Matthews and Tavares and have them running their own power plays.Option OneOkay kiddies, close your eyes and imagine this. Auston Matthews. John Tavares. Mitch Marner. William Nylander. Morgan Rielly. Just sit there and think about it, a power play with those five players on the ice. So how would the lineup work? It is quite easy actually.Matthews \u2013 Tavares \u2013 NylanderRielly \u2013 MarnerConsidering how much the Leafs love to cycle on the PP, they could make it to Rielly and Marner on their opposite side so set up one timers. For now, I will keep every body on their strong sides.Tavares and Matthews are both amazing tippers (no not in restaurants, though they could be). By tipper I mean standing in front of the net and tipping the puck to change the direction and speed it moves at. Those two are in a group of elite tippers. Having one of them (preferably Tavares) is lethal in itself.Now what happens if the shot that Tavares is tipping is coming off of a shot by Matthews or off of a pass by Marner? It will most of the time find the back of the next. That is how good these players are. But Michael, if they get tired who would we put out?Again, this is quite easy. You still have Nazem Kadri, Patrick Marleau, Kasperi Kapanen, Andreas Johnsson and Jake Gardiner sitting on your bench. Kadri is the net front presence, you have the speed of Kapanen and Johnsson, the offensive smarts of Marleau and Gardiner. This lineup can take the other 30 seconds of the PP, while the top line takes the first minute and 30 seconds.If the Leafs do this option they could easily have the best PP in the NHL.Option TwoThe Leafs have offensive depth that is unmatched in the NHL. They could put out two PPs that are very dominating.Marleau \u2013 Matthews \u2013 NylanderGardiner \u2013 KapanenKadri \u2013 Tavares \u2013 JohnssonRielly \u2013 MarnerWith these two lines there is no top power play. Some games the Matthews line will excel while the Tavares line will excel other games. Now just imagine this, Matthews\u2019 line is all over you, you are exhausted and then\u2026Tavares\u2019 line comes on.If the line change is used at a perfect time, the Toronto Maple Leafs could use the fresh leagues of the other unit to really go hard on the tired defending team. That is what makes this team so lethal, they have the speed and skill to tire out the opponent and keep the puck away from them.So which unit do I think the Toronto Maple Leafs will use? Both. I think they will use the second option more but will use the first option when they really have to get back into the game. This is going to be a fun season.", "id": "330"}
{"content": "July 30--SAN DIEGO -- Two days after reporting serious pain in his right elbow, Johnny Cueto was placed on the 10-day disabled list and is out of the team's rotation for the foreseeable future. He'll be joined by Pablo Sandoval, who injured his right hamstring in Sunday's win over the Brewers while scoring on a sacrifice fly.Cueto missed two months earlier this season with a sprained elbow and considered season-ending Tommy John surgery as a possible treatment. Instead, the right-hander opted to rest and recover before trying to pitch again, but he said the pain he felt in Saturday's start against Milwaukee was the same type of pain he dealt with earlier this year.The Giants recalled Kelby Tomlinson from Triple-A Sacramento and returned Joe Panik from his rehab assignment. Panik actually began the day as the starting second baseman for the Sacramento River Cats and went 1-for-2 before being removed from the game and traveling to San Diego.Panik is recovering from a groin strain he suffered July 6 while running the bases against the Cardinals.With Sandoval and first baseman Brandon Belt on the disabled list, utility player Austin Slater is starting at first base in Monday's series opener against the Padres.

Rolling out starting Wednesday, August 1, the new Lenses animate using specific trigger words.First spotted by TechCrunch, the new lenses use speech recognition instead of facial recognition to identify when to trigger an animation. Think asking Alexa for something, only using single word triggers to animate the augmented reality mask. Saying \u201cOK\u201d for example will bring up the hand symbol in one while saying \u201clove\u201d brings dancing hearts in another. On-screen instructions let users know what word will trigger the effect.The update follows the first audio reactive lenses earlier this year, but react to specific words instead of changing with the volume like the lenses launched this spring. Snapchat also has Lenses that play audio and voice-altering options. The voice-activated Lenses join other animated options, like opening your mouth to barf rainbows to gain a slobbery puppy tongue.The animated lenses could prove popular with video, using the keywords to add the effect at a specific point in the recording. The Lenses also work for taking stills, before, after or during the animation. Since there is no requirement to stick your tongue out or raise your eyebrows, you can smile, duck lip (but please don\u2019t) or make whatever expression you can maintain while saying, or just after saying, the keyword.The audio-sparked Lenses are already heading out to the Lens carousel, but some users may not see them for a few days as the feature rolls out. Like other Lenses, Snapchat says the app will update periodically update with new options.Augmented reality lenses are a major focus for the social network, this year alone launching custom face filters in Lens Studio, Lens Explorer to find new Snapchat\u2019s new Snappables Lenses are AR games you play with your face, and Snappables. The latter are game-like Lenses, where the game is controlled by your movement or the touchscreen. Other games use the user\u2019s photo.Earlier this year, the social network launched a new way to monetize the app\u2019s popular Lenses with shoppable AR filters. The filters are unique to the specific product and include a link to the product.", "id": "332"}
{"content": "Aug. 04--OAKLAND -- Looking to add a spark in the outfield, the A's called up hot-hitting Ramon Laureano from Triple-A Nashville.Laureano, 24, is hitting .297 with 14 home runs, 35 RBIs and 11 stolen bases over 64 games in what is his first year at the Triple-A level. But it's the last month where Laureano has really started to turn it on, having hit .373 in the month of July with eight home runs, 18 RBIs and six stolen bases. He arrives to Oakland on an 11-game hit streak, with seven multi-hit performances over that stretch.Nashville manager Fran Riordan pulled Laureano to the side during Wednesday's game to inform him he had been called up to Oakland. Though Laureano said he was \"shocked\" at the time, he knew his numbers were deserving of a promotion.\"I'm just trying to stay patient and control what I can control. I'm just gonna play hard,\" Laureano said. \"I always get a little hot in July, so I knew if it was gonna come, it was gonna come now.\"It's been a nice bounce back for Laureano, who had to miss the first month of the season after breaking his left hand March 12 in a spring training game on a pitch from San Francisco Giants reliever Roberto Gomez.Laureano is considered an athletic outfielder with plus-speed and bat speed who has impressed the A's with his defense this season. The majority of his playing time has come in right field this season, but Laureano can play all three outfield spots.\"We'll start him in center and see how it goes,\" A's manager Bob Melvin said. \"He moves around really well and has a plus-arm. I think he leads Triple-A in assists. I knew at some point in time if he overcame the injury that he would be here.\"Once an Astros prospect expected to patrol the Houston outfield alongside George Springer and Kyle Tucker for years to come, struggles at Double-A made Laureano an expendable piece. He was traded to the A's in November 2017 in exchange for minor league pitcher Brandon Bailey.Though it was a tough 2017 for Laureano as he lost his status as one of the top prospects in Houston's farm system, the outfielder said the poor season may end up a blessing in disguise when he looks back at it now that he's getting a shot with the A's.\"I knew everything was gonna be okay and I was gonna learn from it,\" Laureano said. \"It's in the past so hopefully one day I can say that was the best year of my life.\"With the A's facing left-handers in four of the next five games starting Friday night, Melvin said Laureano will get a good chance to show what he can do at the big league level with plenty of action over the next week.\"When we acquired him I know Billy (Beane) and David (Forst) were talking about how he was basically untouchable with the Astros just a year before and tough to get. When we finally did acquire him he made a great impression in spring,\" Melvin said. \"He's handling left-handed pitching really well, so I think the timing to get him here now is good.\"Dustin Fowler was sent down after Wednesday's game in order to make room for Laureano on the roster. Batting just .231 overall and .176 in July, the A's would like the outfielder to get his confidence back up by playing every day in Nashville, something that diminished over the past month with the emergence of Nick Martini.\"I think he got to a point where he needs to be a little more aggressive in everything he does, whether it's stealing bases or in the outfield,\" Melvin said of Fowler. \"We still feel like he's gonna be the center fielder of the future, but we weren't doing him any favors here by not playing him. He was basically inactive last year and needs consistent at-bats. We will see him back here at some point.\"___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "333"}
{"content": "Aug. 01--It often seems that the phrase Department of Motor Vehicles and the word bureaucracy are synonymous.But this year the California DMV has taken the equivalency to an entirely new level. Getting a driver's license renewed or vehicle registered at a local office now takes hours, often entire days. Even with an appointment.The line-waiting is out of control.The DMV measures average wait times at offices, but they only start the clock once a customer (and they are tax-paying customers, something DMV officials seem to forget) gets inside the door.To them, the time spent in lines winding around the building and down the block doesn't count. As reporter Erin Baldassari documented last month at the Walnut Creek office, customers can be stuck outside in 90-degree heat with little shade and no chairs.It's unacceptable. It must be fixed. And those managers who failed to address the mounting line waits should be replaced.On Aug. 7, the state Assembly Budget Committee will hold a hearing on the fiasco. The following day, the Joint Legislative Audit Committee will hear a request for a state investigation into what went wrong.Both are essential. Action is needed now, but the audit, which will take months, is also critical to determine how things went so horribly wrong.This is a crisis of the DMV's making. The driving factor is the longer time it takes to process a new type of driver's license required by the federal government.So-called \"REAL ID\" identification will be needed to board an airplane starting Oct. 1, 2020. Licenses used for that identification require more stringent -- time-consuming -- processing.VIDEO: Across the Bay Area, average wait times have more than doubled for people with and without appointments, according to the DMV. This is largely due to the demand for the new Real IDs that will be required by the state in October 2020.The DMV started processing applications in January. And the lines, which were already unacceptably long, grew exponentially.We would be sympathetic, but for one key point: The DMV had known this federal requirement was coming for more than a decade. And, despite receiving additional state funding, they failed to adequately prepare.Moreover, when they launched REAL ID, it was supposed to come with new Saturday hours. But they didn't make those Saturday hours available for all transactions, only for REAL ID.In other words, they didn't relieve some of the Monday through Friday pressure so that they could accommodate REAL ID applications during the workweek as well without creating long lines.Finally, starting this week, 60 field offices will be open for full service from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. each Saturday. The DMV in July also launched a new service allowing customers to fill in forms at home before they get to the office, saving data entry time for workers.How much these changes will make a difference remains to be seen. But this problem will not be solved until customers with appointments can walk in, take care of their business and leave without enduring lengthy lines.They should be treated with the respect they deserve.___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "334"}
{"content": "With the Pac-12 championship, San Francisco Bowl and national championship all slated to be played in the Bay Area this season, many are hoping to prove that the region will embrace college football.  Of course, the threeames also will be a boon to the area\u2019s pro teams. 49ers general manager John Lynch said he wasn\u2019t sold on first-round pick Mike McGlinchey until he saw the Notre Dame offensive tackle in person at Stanford. \u201cI\u2019ll be at the national championship for many reasons. One of them is the story of Mike McGlinchey,\u201d Lynch said at Monday\u2019s Touchdown Tailgate luncheon in Santa Clara. \u201cYou saw him on tape over and over and over, but one of the things that sold me was seeing him in person against Stanford. \u201c I was down on field in the Notre Dame end zone during pregame warm-ups and watched his attention to detail. It was like he played a game before the game. For college football players, sometimes it\u2019s the little things that differentiate them, and those are the things you can see in person. \u201cI can\u2019t wait for this game to be here.\u201d Tight End U: After receiving a text from 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan about an injured tight end, Lynch joked that he\u2019d just borrow one from Stanford. The Cardinal, who probably run as many two-tight-end sets as anyone team in the country, are adding 6-foot-4, 230-pound freshman TaeVeonLe to a group that included Kaden Smith, Colby Parkinson and Scooter Harrington. The returners combined for 36 catches, 521 yards and nine touchdowns last season. \u201cI was going to call my buddy David Shaw, because I know he just stockpiles tight ends up at Stanford,\u201d Lynch joked. \u201cIf we could take one on loan, so we don\u2019t have to fly someone out for a couple of days, that would be great.\u201d  Just for kicks: Brent Brennan said he learned a ton during his first season as San Jose State\u2019s head coach, namely letting Bryce Crawford attempt field goals from yardage that other coaches wouldn\u2019t even consider. Crawford had five field goals of at least 50 yards last season. Including Crawford\u2019s five, the school has had 17 such kicks in its history. \u201cLast year as first-time head coach, I made a couple of stupid decision to go for it on 4th-and-short from just past the 50,\u201d Brennan said. \u201cI should have just let him bang another 55-yarder. I\u2019m learning as I go.\u201d 3.0 for No. 9: About a year ago, Brennan told Boogie Roberts that he could wear a single-digit jersey number if he maintained a 3.0 or better grade-point average. The senior defensive lineman has gotten at least a 3.4 since then and is listed as No. 9 on the roster. Lockdown corner? Brennan played receiver at UCLA from 1993 through \u201994, and Shaw played receiver at Stanford from 1991 through \u201994, so naturally, Cal head coach Justin Wilcox, a defensive back at Oregon from 1996 through \u201999, was asked how he would have covered the Bay Area\u2019s other head coaches. \u201cProbably a lot of double coverage,\u201d joked Wilcox, who didn\u2019t allow a touchdown reception his senior season. \u201cWe\u2019d try to make them run the ball. We\u2019d force their hand and make them run it.\u201d  Rusty Simmons is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.", "id": "335"}
{"content": "The first Amway Coaches Poll of the 2018 college football season was released this past week. How different will the AP Top 25 look later in the month?Like pretty much every college football writer around the country, I spend the better part of a half hour hitting refresh on my computer Thursday afternoon, waiting for USA Today to publish the first Amway Coaches Poll of the season.It was late, but there were very few big surprises.One of those few surprises was how high the coaches had Notre Dame at No. 11. Given what we know the team lost from a personnel standpoint, combined with all that we\u2019ve read since the end of last season, I thought the Irish would be lower.Apparently the coaches aren\u2019t buying into a sharp drop-off for Notre Dame in 2018.I also found it interesting that the coaches had Michigan lower than Notre Dame. Between the Shea Patterson hype and returning the bulk of what many national writers and pundits have called one of the nation\u2019s best defenses, I was expecting to see the Wolverines higher than the Irish \u2014 possibly in the top ten.It also makes you look at the line for the Michigan-Notre Dame game and rethink what the wise guys in Vegas have been saying. Even though the game is at Notre Dame, the Wolverines are favored across the board.Something tells me that when the first AP Top 25 rankings come out on August 21st, Michigan and Notre Dame will be flip-flopped. The media treats both programs different than the coaches do. They have more bias, and their loyalty often is to a region or conference. The coaches, on the other hand, are loyal to their programs and their friends.In addition to the Wolverines being ranked ahead of Notre Dame in the AP Top 25, don\u2019t be surprised to see other 2018 Irish foes like Stanford and Southern Cal ahead of the Irish.At the end of the day, you want to think what happens on the field is all that matters. We have seen, however, that where you start in the preseason polls can drive the narrative, set the tone and contribute greatly to where you finish the season \u2014 regardless of what actually happens on the field.", "id": "336"}
{"content": "Anxiety relief may seem like a far-fetched idea when you are sweating and immersed in a stressful situation. The good news is that there are anxiety relief techniques that can be used to help you recover from these feelings. By immediately applying one of these techniques as soon as you start feeling the uncomfortable symptoms of anxiety, you can lessen and ultimately eliminate the negative feelings associated with the stressful situations that cause these out of control feelings.Here are some anxiety relief techniques to help you feel calm:1. VisualizationThis is one of the many anxiety relief techniques that enjoys great popularity. You have to imagine a favorite spot that is peaceful. Some examples might include the beach or your grandmother\u2019s kitchen. You can focus on any place that you have a vivid memory of that makes you feel calm.     It is important that you focus on the experience through your senses. Recalling the sights, sounds and smells of that place will soothe your nerves. Closing your eyes and sitting in a comfortable spot can help. For instance, if you are imagining the beach, you might hear the seagull\u2019s call and the waves crash against the shore. Think about your toes in the sand and the warm sun on your face. Can\u2019t you smell the sea and taste the salt on your lips.2. Deep BreathingOne of the most widely accepted anxiety relief techniques is deep breathing. One of the pieces of advice we\u2019ve all heard when things are falling apart is to \u201ctake a deep breath.\u201d When life gets a bit too exciting or stressful, deep breathing from the diaphragm is a great first step to take.     According to clinical psychologist Marla Diebler who was quoted in Psych Central, deep breathing removes your body from the stress reaction known as flight-or-fight response returning your body to a more relaxed response. Count to four as you inhale deeply and steadily, then hold your breath for four more seconds, finally exhaling slowly while once again counting to four for anxiety relief.3. Autogenic RelaxationThe word autogenic refers to something that generates from within, or inside you. Anxiety relief techniques can be used to relax muscle tension. Repeating certain words that calm you down can help you reset your body and mind, returning to a better state. Telling yourself to calm down over and over again while sitting comfortably and visualizing pleasant imagery can work wonders to reduce the impact of an anxious situation, resulting with a slower heart rate and better state of mind.4. MeditateMeditation is an ancient technique that has been used for centuries to center your thoughts as one of the most long-standing anxiety relief techniques embraced by many cultures. Some people meditate daily and swear by the many benefits provided. According to psychologist, Robbie Maller Hartman, PhD as quoted in WebMD, daily meditation is believed to actually change your brain\u2019s neural pathways, essentially making you more capable of managing stress.     Sit up straight in a comfortable chair and relax with both feet placed squarely on the floor. Close your eyes to get rid of distractions and start reciting positive words that calm you. Reciting a mantra such as, \u201cI am filled with peace\u201d or \u201cI love my life,\u201d will help you recover from stress.There are many different types of meditation techniques. Finding the one that works best for you may take some experimentation. Based on the number of people who claim that meditation has changed their life, it is certainly worth a try.While these types of movement oriented ancient arts won\u2019t work for all people, many have practiced these physical practices to distract from negative feelings. Added benefits include improved balance. In particular, yoga has soared in popularity in the U.S. in recent years.ConclusionThere is no reason to suffer from anxiety symptoms. You can take charge of the situation and use anxiety relief techniques to calm down. While there are medications you can take to relieve severe anxiety issues, it makes more sense for most people who suffer from anxiety to use the techniques above instead. Since it is impossible to eliminate stress from life, learning to cope with it in a positive manner is a practical solution that all people can use for a happier life experience.", "id": "337"}
{"content": "Aug. 04--The Midwest has lots of strange and wonderful regional dishes, and I feel safe saying no person has documented them as exhaustively as Titus Ruscitti.On his website, Smokin' Chokin' and Chowing With the King, he posts about nearly everything he's eaten, from barbecue in Austin, Texas, to jerk chicken in Jamaica. But the bulk of his posts are about cruising around the Midwest in search of the best local food.Have a favorite burger joint in the small Midwest town near where you grew up? Ruscitti has probably been there. That was definitely true for me when he wrote about the tiny hamburgers at Hinkle's (204 W. Main St., Madison, Ind.).I sat down with Ruscitti at B'el Bar + Kitchen (3188 N. Elston Ave.), which specializes in serving regional Midwest dishes like pork tenderloin sandwiches and Cincinnati chili, to get his opinions on what you should look for on your next road trip. The interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.Q: What's the one Midwest food that you're surprised isn't more popular?A: Three or four years ago, I would have said smashed cheeseburgers. They originated in central Illinois. That's where Steak 'n Shake started. But now those are everywhere. The Detroit Coney dog is also great. The best places use Koegel brand natural-casing hot dogs. It's a really good hot dog. The Coney sauce is sort of like chili, but it's so smooth.Q: Are you surprised that Detroit pizza is so popular now?A: I'm not surprised because it's so good. I love it. Buddy's Pizza (17125 Conant St., Detroit) is my stop. Every time I'm in Detroit, I make sure to swing by Buddy's.Q: Explain to me the appeal of pork tenderloin sandwiches.A: Honestly, it's the whole regional food thing. If I'm in Iowa or Indiana, that's what I get. I mean, it's just fried pork. Sure, it's not the most exciting thing, but when done right, it's not much different from great fried chicken. I just like checking out the local spots. When I was in Budapest, I tried a version of pork schnitzel, because it is really popular there.Q: Is there any difference between the pork tenderloin sandwiches in Indiana and Iowa?A: Iowa is better. Or the better ones in Iowa are better than the best ones in Indiana. In Iowa, they are so juicy. It's not as much about being the biggest one; it's more about the juiciness. They use great pork, and it's thicker. That said, it's still only a once- or twice-a-year thing for me.Q: You're an admitted fan of the Detroit Coney hot dog. What about Coney dogs elsewhere in the Midwest?A: The chili cheese dog is so American. I actually love this thing called the Spanish dog in Rochester, Ind. You'll find it at B &amp; K Drive In (1201 E. Ninth St., Rochester, Ind.), which used to be a larger chain in the area. Spanish sauce is its thing. I don't think it has anything to do with Spain. Basically, it's a chili sauce, but with more tomato. They do Spanish burgers too.Q: What's an overrated Midwest food?A: Honestly, the one I'm done with is the horseshoe (toast topped with a burger patty and fries, and covered in a cheese sauce). I've had a bunch in Springfield, and they are always OK, but good luck enjoying the rest of your day.Q: What about Springfield chili (which also is not exactly light)?A: I actually like it. But you can only have one cup. There's so much grease. I like it with cheese and crackers. When in Rome.Q: And Cincinnati chili?A: I really do like the combination of chili and pasta. It's great. Last time I was in Cincinnati, I went to Price Hill Chili (4920 Glenway Ave., Cincinnati, Ohio). The shop is so old-school, and I love that vibe. You know, the classic stools and long counter.Q: You've spent some time recently in St. Louis. What do you think of the food there?A: It definitely has some of the weirder stuff. The St. Paul sandwich is so strange.Q: Yeah. It's egg foo young on white bread, and it's named after a Minnesota city, though it originated in St. Louis.A: I love those regional American-Chinese dishes.Q: What else can you find?The brain sandwich. It's sort of like a pork tenderloin, but slightly more tender. Over the river in Illinois, there's Buffalo fish. It's a very flaky fish. It's sliced and then fried, and you rip it off in pieces. I always look for toasted ravioli, and it's not exactly weird, but how can you enjoy more than two of them? And then they put Provel cheese on pizza.Q: What do you think of Provel?A: Honestly, I think it kind of tastes like cardboard.Q: People might not immediately think of fried tacos as something prevalent in the Midwest, but you've found a surprising number of them.A: I think people think of fried tacos as definitely big in California and Arizona, but they are also in the Midwest. And I don't mean places like Taco Bell that buy fried shells, but places that fry the whole taco to order. Surprisingly, Racine, Wis., has so many fried taco places. You'll also find them in the Quad Cities and East St. Louis.Q: What about further up north?A: Minnesota has the juicy Lucy, where they put cheese in the middle of a burger patty. Upstate has fry bread tacos. It's sort of an American-Indian thing. Obviously, they serve a lot of fried walleye, which I absolutely love.Q: Where is your favorite place to travel in the Midwest?A: Wisconsin is my favorite. It's just a beautiful state. It has two Great Lakes and the Mississippi River. I love fried tacos, and Racine has so many of them. And the pizza. They serve tavern-style thin crust pizza there. There are so many old-school spots like Maria's Pizza (5025 W. Forest Home Ave., Milwaukee, Wis.). And while you'll still find a lot of fried fish nights at bars, taco nights are becoming nearly as popular.Q: I'm a little confused by the loose meat sandwich, which is big in Iowa.A: I like the loose meat sandwich. When done right, it has the flavor profile of a slider. I actually get them at Leon's Drive In (3131 S. 27th St., Milwaukee, Wis.). It's called a Spanish hamburger, actually, though it has nothing to do with the Spanish dog in Indiana.nkindelsperger@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "338"}
{"content": "Aug. 01--David Casarez came west to Silicon Valley with his life in a van and startup dreams in his eyes. Within months, the web developer and would-be entrepreneur was hugging Apple CEO Tim Cook and interviewing at the legendary tech firm.But no job offer came, from Apple or any other company, and Casarez found himself sleeping in stairwells and on park benches, surviving on pouches of tuna and ramen-noodle cups, twitching at every night-time noise and weeping over his plight, he says.Now, after a random photo of Casarez standing with a job-search sign beside a Mountain View intersection went viral, he's fielding expressions of interest from some 200 companies, more than 70 in the Bay Area.\"I was just out there at the intersection hoping that somebody at least would take my resume and give me a job offer in the Bay Area,\" said Casarez, 26.From Austin, Texas, to rock bottom in California, and back up to his current perch sifting through the many missives from potential employers, Casarez embodies the classic Silicon Valley reinvention tale of dreams pursued, dashed, and dreamed again. He has, in tech-talk, failed upward.When Casarez arrived in California from Austin in September, he was already working to develop a food-service startup. He figured he'd get a job at another startup while he continued to build his own. He had three years' experience in tech jobs at General Motors, a bachelor's degree in information-systems management from Texas A&amp;M, an old iPhone, a strong faith in the \"lean startup\" method, and $20,000 from cashing out his 401k, he said in an interview this week.\"I felt very confident,\" he said.At a networking event, he met an investor interested in his startup idea, but a budding deal fell through over differences in vision, he said. The hoped-for job interviews weren't happening. He lacked connections, and concluded outsiders have a tough time getting tech work in Silicon Valley. Then an idea arrived, a way to make valuable industry connections by making a splash at a high-profile event.For three days in November, Casarez camped out in front of an Apple store in Palo Alto to be first in line to buy the just-unveiled $1,000 iPhone X. He succeeded, and made a very powerful connection when CEO Tim Cook wrapped his arms around Casarez in a congratulatory hug. Soon, Casarez was invited for an interview at Apple's campus. But the job, he said, went to someone already working for the company.The downward slide began. Casarez was sleeping in his van in Mountain View to save money, and had calculated the \"burn rate\" at which his cash reserves were dwindling. He'd figured his nest egg would last six months, maybe seven.\"I was barely scraping by in March,\" he said. He started to miss payments on his van. In early June, the vehicle was repossessed, and he was on the streets, sleeping in a park, he said.\"It was very hard, because when I was living in the van I had the safety of knowing I was enclosed,\" he said. \"I was literally at the very bottom.\"He'd never imagined his own choices could bring him so low. Depression took hold. \"I was crying a lot -- 'How did I let it get to this point?'\" he said. \"It really got to me.\"He held onto a gym membership so he could shower, but as his savings vanished, he had to sell the iPhone X. Deep inside, he held onto hope. And he decided to fight back against his self-created disaster.\"I told myself, 'I'm not going to let this break me,'\" he said.That's when he decided he needed to do something new to stand out. So he stood out, on the sidewalk where El Camino Real and San Antonio Road come together in Mountain View, and held up a sign saying, \"Homeless Hungry 4 Success Take a Resume.\" He was not taking money, he said.That was on Friday, when passerby Jasmine Scofield asked permission to take his photo, and posted it, along with a photo of his resume, on Twitter. The social media platform went mad. As of Tuesday evening, Scofield's tweet had been shared more than 138,000 times.\"I didn't think people were going to think anything of it -- there's people who stand at corners all the time, asking for money, asking for beer, asking for whatever,\" said Casarez, whose Twitter profile now features his \"Hungry 4 Success\" mantra and includes an email for media inquiries.Casarez's life was instantly transformed. Television and newspaper reporters were calling, and he had to limit his media availability after Monday so he could devote himself to responding to prospective employers who contacted him, he said.\"I really want to make the right decision, and take the time to do that,\" Casarez said. \"For it to have turned out the way it has, it's just been a blessing. It's just given me hope to move forward.\"One of those who saw Scofield's tweet was Austen Allred, CEO of Lambda School, a Pleasanton company that trains software engineers at no up-front cost, and operates a fund for homeless students in its program. Casarez's story struck a chord with Allred, who in 2016 spent months living out of his car in Palo Alto after arriving from Utah in pursuit of a tech job.\"I view it as my responsibility to help the people who are in the same position that I was,\" Allred said, adding that he admires anyone like Casarez who \"searches for a job a just hustles.\"Lambda is providing Casarez with up to three months in an Airbnb and mentoring for his interview process.Casarez's story appears headed for a happier ending than he imagined when he was sleeping in stairwells, but his struggle is not unique, said Carl Guardino, CEO of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, which represents businesses in the region.\"People desperately want to come here, work here, innovate here and succeed here, yet we're pricing out the folks who already live here and making it much more difficult for folks who want to come here, because for 20 years we've under-invested in the fact that workers and their families actually need a place to live,\" Guardino said.___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "339"}
{"content": "Just do it: open that digital checkbook and place a bet on the future of footwear using the stock market.  Despite bricks-and-mortar retailing continuing to fall apart at the hands of Amazon (AMZN) , Morgan Stanley thinks the footwear industry is one place in retail for investors to hide out and win big.  \"The athletic footwear engine has multiple cylinders: (1) innovation-led pricing power, (2) a direct-to-consumer (DTC) mix shift that's margin accretive, (3) strong brands, and (4) a near Nike-Adidas duopoly,\" says Morgan Stanley retail analyst Kimberly Greenberger.  Adds the long-time retail stock picker, \"We see global activewear (active apparel and footwear) gaining 250 basis points of [market] share over the next five years, reaching ~20% of global apparel and footwear sales.

Nike Greenberger is the most bullish on sneaker king Nike (NKE) , with good reason. Nike's scale, technological prowess and brand recognition are virtually unmatched in the footwear industry. Each should serve investors well long-term.  \"We believe Nike is in early innings of transitioning from a traditional wholesale business to an emerging retail technology company,\" says Greenberger.\" Nike is positioned to take share in the high-growth, global activewear market as well as increase profitability, which should make it one of the highest growth consumer names and one of the few to benefit from the shift to eCommerce.\" The market seems to agree: shares of Dow Jones Industrial Average component Nike have skyrocketed 24% this year.  Foot Locker Foot Locker's (FL) days as a market darling have died following a series of challenging quarters. Greenberger thinks Foot Locker's lagging stock price this year (down slightly) is a sign of what's to come in a world shifting to digital shopping. \"Foot Locker is losing traction in the emerging direct-to-consumer world,\" Greenberger says. \"With Nike products representing 67% of Foot Locker merchandise, investors assume if Nike returns to growth, so must Foot Locker. We're not convinced. Our detailed Nike/Foot Locker overlap analysis reveals that 46% of Nike.com SKUs [stock keeping units] aren't available on FootLocker.com. Plus, Foot Locker's top 10% of customers represent a high percentage of its sales and our AlphaWise survey shows 34% of 15- to 24-year-olds (Foot Locker's core customers) prefer to shop through brands' stores or online.\"  Cautions Greenberger, \"If these core customers increasingly shop directly with Nike, Foot Locker could experience outsized sales declines. Our 2018 and 2019 earnings per share estimates are 4% and 7% below consensus.\" A wager against Foot Locker would be the way to go, based on Greenberger's analysis.

Given the popularity of the Alexa-powered device, customers jumped at the chance to get it for free.It was unclear why Amazon would be giving away the white Echo Spot when its black counterpart was being sold at $99.99. That was a $30 discount, but nowhere near as valuable as getting a smart speaker for free.Was Amazon sending out free Echo Spot smart speakers to apologize for something? Was the company trying to get rid of old stock to make way for a new batch? Was the website hacked, with the attackers thinking that setting the Echo Spot price at $0 was their best move?Unfortunately for Amazon customers who were able to place an order for a $0 Echo Spot, it was too good to be true.Amazon has started to cancel the orders that were placed for the Echo Spot during the brief window when it was free.\"We noticed an error in an order you recently placed and wanted to make you aware of the issue.

{"content": "Netflix VP, Cindy Holland, is teasing a great return for Daredevil in the show\u2019s third season.Daredevil is dead. At least that\u2019s what his fellow heroes think. If you watched The Defenders, you know how it ended and we know a little more than Danny Rand, Luke Cage and Jessica Jones do about Matt Murdock\u2019s fate.The closing scene for Matt shows us the influence that \u201cBorn Again\u201d will have on the show\u2019s third season. The story arc is one written by Frank Miller in 1986 and the graphic novel includes Daredevil #227\u2013233. That\u2019s two issues more than the initial run and they were added to tie up some loose ends. If you want to know more about the general direction it looks like they\u2019ll take with season three, be sure to go read those issues.Season 2 of the show dropped way back when in May 2016, so aside from his role in The Defenders, it\u2019s been a while since we\u2019ve had a Matt Murdock-centric story. Even in the second season, there was a big focus on Elektra and introducing the Punisher.When speaking with Deadline, Netflix Vice President Cindy Holland mentioned that the new season would be a return to form.\u201cThe biggest issue was the timing of production and launching of The Defenders because what that meant is we had to shut down all of the shows, so all the actors be available for The Defendersso it\u2019s more function of that,\u201d Holland told Deadline. \u201cThere is no problem with this season, I think it\u2019s fantastic, it\u2019s real return to form in my view.\u201dAs someone who loved the first season of Daredevil, this is something I\u2019m excited to hear. The second season was more cluttered than it needed to be. While I\u2019m still not sold on most of these seasons needing to be 13 episodes, I understand that it\u2019s that way because of the initial deals they made.A \u201creturn to form\u201d doesn\u2019t necessarily mean we\u2019re going back to the all-black \u201csuit\u201d that Matt initially wore. That one isn\u2019t quite as protective as his updated, red suit, so let\u2019s all hope he keeps that one. However, I\u2019m hoping that this means we\u2019ll get back to the great storytelling that we had in season 1 as Matt went up against Wilson Fisk. It\u2019ll still be hard to top that season, but \u201cBorn Again\u201d is a classic story and I hope they use it well.Right now, there isn\u2019t a release date set for the third season, but it is expected to release in March of 2019, like the first two seasons. You can watch the first two seasons on Netflix now, though, if you need a refresher on what was going on with Matt before The Defenders released.", "id": "342"}

(Photo by Ezra Shaw/Getty Images)The Oakland Raiders defense has been its Achilles heel in recent years, but there is reason to believe it will be better in 2018.The Raiders defensive struggles are truly tough to define because in all honesty, it really shouldn\u2019t be as bad as it is. On paper, the defense looks great. Khalil Mack leads the pass rush with Bruce Irvin, Eddie Vanderdoes, and Justin Ellis. The linebackers are a different story as that position has been a revolving door for so long that it is hard to track. However, the secondary should have been much better than it has been with guys like David Amerson and Sean Smith in the past.Point is, the defense has been really bad. So bad that it is tough to watch at times. However, this year things could be different and there are multiple reasons for optimism. With a new defensive coordinator in town and plenty more talent added to the roster, the defense will look a lot different.The offense is a proven commodity and will likely be solid in 2018, so the path to success falls primarily on the defense now. If the defense can do its job and help keep the offense on the field, the Raiders could be a legitimate playoff threat. If they struggle, and the offense has to put up 35 or more every week, the Raiders will find themselves in the cellar.Luckily, there is more than enough reason to have faith that the defense will finally put it all together. Here are the three main reasons why the defense will be much better in 2018.", "id": "343"}
{"content": "There are many ways these days for investors to gain exposure to international markets. The best-know options include ETFs and open-end mutual funds. But there's also a third way, one that can provide a highly targeted approach for investors who see gold in sometimes obscure or illiquid niches that your typical ETF or open-end fund aren't designed to handle. That third way is the closed-end fund, actively managed funds that stand out for providing skilled managers with a relatively stable capital base and the ability to use leverage to boost returns. The combination of stable capital and leverage, in turn, provides closed-end fund managers focused on international markets the freedom to take more chances and seek out and profit from niches as varied as the \"Caribbean Basin\" to small-cap Japanese stocks. \"For U.S. investors, there are not a lot of options for small-cap Japanese stocks,\" says Greg Neer, at Relative Value Partners, a Northbrook, Ill., wealth management firm. Getting into the weeds Closed-end funds provide a way of not just investing internationally, but of really drilling down into the sub-terrain of foreign markets in search of market-beating profits. Just take Aberdeen Asset Management, which offers a number of closed-end funds with an in-depth focus on various international markets. Aberdeen's emerging markets fund (ABEMX) has investments in 20 different countries. While the biggest stake is in China -- including large investments in China mobile and Taiwan semiconductor businesses -- the fund also has money in Malaysia, Romania, Russia, Brazil, India, Thailand, and Turkey, among others. Aberdeen has other funds that focus exclusively on India, Japan and Australia. Herzfeld's Caribbean Basin Fund, which goes by the catchy trading name (CUBA) , focuses not just on the late Fidel Castro's erstwhile socialist paradise, but also Jamaica, Trinidad, Tobago, Puerto Rico, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and Aruba, among other islands. Eighty percent of the fund is invested in various securities, including those of U.S. companies with substantial business dealings and trade in the Caribbean. Have a yen for Japanese small-cap plays? There's There's Nomura Asset Management's $376 million Japan Smaller Capitalization Fund (JOF) , which has stakes in Okinawa Cellular, among other firms. Active management Closed-end funds that focus on international markets bring to the game something ETFs typically don't -- active management. When dealing with niche foreign markets, having a locally-based fund manager and expert leading the effort can offer a significant advantage. \"It creates the ability for some managers to not be as index orientated in some of these more specific markets,\" RVP's Neer says. Local knowledge of the market, the company, the country and the culture can all be crucial factors in determining whether an investment is successful. If the fund is focused on Chinese companies in particular provinces, then you need a fund manager based in those areas with an in-depth knowledge of the local market and the businesses that are being eyed, says Ken Nuttall, director of financial planning BlackDiamond Wealth Management in New York. \"You have to judge it on how good the manager is,\" Nuttall says. \"You have to find a guy who is very talented in finding those niches.\" There's also another advantage closed-end funds bring to the international investment game, and that's a stable capital structure. Closed-end funds issue shares during an IPO. The number of shares remains fixed and does not expand or contract based on market activity like it does with an ETF or an open-end mutual fund. The fixed number of shares means closed-end fund managers don't have to fear a big outflow if they start buying shares in a high-reward but high-risk sector. Shares can change hands in daily trading but the overall number stays the same. This structure provides managers with the capital stability they need to take on riskier investments, such as smaller companies in developing markets. \"Active management in emerging market securities is more impactful than in the U.S. large cap market,\" Neer says. \"There would be more opportunities for a good manager to outperform.\" A buying opportunity Closed-end funds with an international focus are also selling at an attractive discount to net asset value. The Japan Smaller Capitalization Fund, for example, is trading at a nearly 12.5% discount. Herzfeld's Carribean Basin Fund, or CUBA, is trading at an 18.3 percent discount. Essentially, that means their share prices are lower than the value of the portfolio of assets in the fund. There are a couple factors that help create discounts in the closed-end fund world. After a closed-end fund issues shares through an IPO, the number of shares remains fixed and does not expand or contract based on market activity like it does with an ETF. This fixed-share structure means the price a closed-end fund trades at each day and the net asset value of its underlying portfolio float independently of each other. And while this can sometimes result in closed-end share prices that trade at a premium, or higher than their net asset value, or NAV, more frequently it results in a discount situation. This can create opportunities to buy more with less, with investors able to effectively buy a portfolio of Japanese small cap stocks for a little over 87 cents on the dollar, or stakes in businesses in Cuba and other Caribbean nations for an even cheaper 81 cents on the dollar. On top of that, international equities are selling on the cheap right now as well, especially compared to the U.S. stock market, which is bouncing around at all-time highs. \"Foreign investment in general is cheaper now, but you do you have your headwinds, your trade wars out there,\" Nuttall says. However, given how high stocks in the U.S. are right now, there is probably more upside right now in emerging markets, Nuttall says. \"Emerging markets have better growth prospects,\" he says. Brian Fischer, a financial advisor at Evensky &amp; Katz/ Foldes Financial Wealth Management in Miami, agrees. \"Whenever I talk to a client interested in closed-end funds their interest almost always comes from the substantial discounts to NAV that they hear about,\" Fischer write in an email. \"Lately, with international stock valuations seemingly cheaper than U.S. stocks, there would appear to be an additional margin of safety to supplement discounted international closed-end funds.\" But Fischer adds a cautionary note -- discounts from net asset value on closed-end funds don't typically vanish overnight, offering investors a speedy windfall. Rather, it can take time for a discount to narrow and investors to reap the reward.\"It's important to keep in mind that discounts from NAV can and do persist,\" Fischer notes. \"From a behavioral perspective, this can be a huge challenge for those that aren't willing to hold on and stay the course.\"", "id": "344"}
{"content": "July 25--Facebook can no longer let advertisers exclude ad targets based on race, religion, national origin, sexual orientation and other protected characteristics under an agreement with Washington state's attorney general.A couple of years ago, the social media company was shown to have been allowing housing advertisers to exclude targets for their ads based on \"ethnic affinity,\" raising questions about whether the ads violated the federal Fair Housing Act.ProPublica was able to buy housing ads that allowed it to exclude users with African-American, Asian-American and Hispanic ethnic affinities on Facebook's self-service ad portal. Facebook told ProPublica in October 2016 that \"ethnic affinity\" doesn't necessarily mean race, and that advertisers needed to be able to exclude certain groups when they target ads. However, Facebook -- under pressure from groups such as the Congressional Black Caucus -- said a couple of weeks later that it would make changes.Facebook allowing such exclusion in ad targeting was \"unlawful discrimination,\" Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson said in a statement Tuesday, when he announced that the Silicon Valley giant had signed the legally binding agreement after a 20-month investigation by his office.Ferguson noted that Facebook continued to approve discriminatory ads as late as November 2017, when ProPublica reported that it was still able to buy ads that excluded groups including African-Americans, Jews and Spanish speakers. In late November, Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg wrote in a letter to the Congressional Black Caucus that the company was disabling advertisers' option to exclude ad targets based on \"multicultural affinity segments.\"The Washington attorney general announced broader requirements for Facebook to follow that go beyond housing, credit and employment ads. The social media giant also must not allow ad-target exclusion by ethnic groups for ads for insurance and public accommodations -- meaning all businesses open to the public. Advertisers may not exclude ad targets based on \"race, creed, color, national origin, veteran or military status, sexual orientation and disability status,\" the agreement says.Facebook must make changes to comply with the agreement within 90 days, and Ferguson said the company assured him the changes would apply nationwide.In December 2017, Facebook, Amazon and others were sued by three workers and the Communication Workers of America over alleged discrimination against older workers. The lawsuit came on the same day ProPublica and the New York Times reported that companies were able to exclude older workers in employment ads on Facebook, LinkedIn and Google.The Washington attorney general's agreement with Facebook this week does not mention age as a protected characteristic, and his office did not immediately return a request for comment Wednesday.Facebook also did not immediately return a request for comment.___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "345"}

{"content": "July 27--SAN FRANCISCO -- The Giants reinstated third baseman Evan Longoria Thursday, adding a key hitter to the lineup just in time to replace the bat of Brandon Belt, who's headed to the 10-day disabled list after hyperextending his right knee in Seattle Wednesday afternoon.In addition, the Giants recalled right-hander Chris Stratton from Triple-A Sacramento and sent down infielder Kelby Tomlinson. Amidst the flurry of moves, the team also optioned left-hander Ty Blach to Triple-A Sacramento only to recall him Thursday.The Giants ultimately decided to place Belt on the disabled list because an MRI revealed a bone bruise in his knee Thursday.\"He's going to be down for a few days, probably five days before he can start doing some activities,\" Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. \"We decided to put him on the disabled list to give him time to get ready. It's hard to go short when he probably won't be playing for 10 days.\"Longoria, who's been sidelined with a fractured hand since June 15, will hit in the No. 5 hole and play third against the Milwaukee Brewers Thursday night.The Giants are hoping that Longoria will give the middle of the lineup some much-needed pop. The team's heavy bats aren't getting the job done right now. Belt was 1 for 33 before he injured his knee while legging out an infield single Wednesday. All-Star shortstop Brandon Crawford is batting .162 with just three extra base hits in the month of July, outfielder Andrew McCutchen is hitting .212 with two extra base hits over the same period and catcher Buster Posey is stuck on five home runs and 32 RBI through 85 games.Longoria, meanwhile, has been somewhat of a disappointment since he joined the Giants in a trade with the Tampa Bay Rays last winter. Before he broke his hand six weeks ago, Longoria posted a .711 OPS with 10 home runs and 34 RBI in 67 games.The Giants are hoping his bat catches fire as they attempt to chase down the Los Angeles Dodgers, Arizona Diamondbacks and Colorado Rockies in the National League West standings.\"I assume he feels fine at the plate,\" Bochy said. \"He better because he's in there.\"The Giants are also hoping that Thursday's moves will provide some relief to the bullpen.Stratton, who started 18 games in the first half, will serve as a long man from the right side while Blach tackles the same duties from the left side. Having a pair of arms available in the middle innings could ease some of the burden placed on the shoulders of Reyes Moronta and Ray Black, who've combined to throw 14 2/3 innings this month.\"That's the idea,\" Bochy said. \"Go with the extra pitcher, lighten the load for them. If we're in a situation where we're in the fifth, I can get one of those two up and not worry about not having a long man later.\"Bochy said Belt's placement on the disabled list allowed the club to keep Blach on the roster. If the team had received a more optimistic prognosis on Belt's health, Blach would have been reassigned to the minors, which is why he was optioned and recalled Thursday.-- Joe Panik will start a rehabilitation assignment with Triple-A Sacramento Thursday.___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "348"}

{"content": "Aug. 01--OAKLAND -- Rumors swirled just before Tuesday's 1 p.m. PDT nonwaiver trade deadline that the A's had a deal in place to acquire starting pitcher Mike Fiers from the Detroit Tigers. Reports then came out about five minutes later saying contract issues would prevent the deal. Fiers is on a 1-year, $6 million deal and arbitration eligible for 2019.Turns out it was more about asking price than money.\"No, money was not an issue,\" Tigers GM Al Avila told Anthony Fenech of the Detroit Free Press. \"Really, for us, what we're trying to accumulate is the best players and talent possible so money was never an issue.\"Fiers, 33, would have represented a significant upgrade for the A's starting rotation. The right-hander has been solid for the Tigers: 7-6 with a 3.54 ERA in 20 starts with 86 strikeouts and only 26 walks over 117 innings.A's general manager David Forst said the club was in on several players over the past week and looking to make a deal, but the asking prices in terms of prospects were ultimately too high on some of the players targeted.\"A lot of things have to come together to make any deal. Ownership showed they were willing to take on money with the (Jeurys) Familia deal, so that wasn't an issue,\" Forst said. \"It's also about getting the right guy. It has to be the right fit, and it just didn't come together today.\"The A's (62-46) find themselves in a surprising playoff race. They enter Tuesday night's game against Toronto only two games behind the Seattle Mariners for the second American League wild-card spot and five games behind the Houston Astros for first place in the AL West.Other than Sean Manaea, the A's have not had a starting pitcher complete seven innings since Chris Bassitt went seven June 9 against the Kansas City Royals. Bassitt, currently in the minor leagues, is one of 12 pitchers who have made a start for the A's this season. Fiers had averaged just under six innings per start this season.Failing to add to their pitching rotation, the A's will continue hoping starters can provide five or six quality innings before turning matters over to the bullpen. The A's relief staff has been dominant. Only six teams in the majors have a lower ERA (3.42) and none can match Oakland's 28 wins.A's manager Bob Melvin might have foreshadowed this scenario Monday when asked if he thought the club would make a deal at the deadline.\"I try not to look too much into it. I don't want to be disappointed,\" Melvin said. \"I like the roster we have. If we don't do anything else, I'm happy with it. If we do, that'd be a nice surprise.\"The A's did bolster their bullpen just over a week ago with the addition of Jeurys Familia from the New York Mets, giving them what they believe are three closer-type pitchers to pitch the final three innings of games. But workload out of the bullpen will be an issue, especially as the dog days of August begin.Yusmeiro Petit currently leads all AL relievers in innings pitched, and back-end pieces Lou Trivino and Blake Treinen are both on pace to eclipse their highest innings pitched totals of their careers as relievers.There is still the Aug. 31 waiver trade deadline, which often features teams looking to shed contracts. We saw how that worked out for the Astros last year when they landed Justin Verlander.There probably won't be a Verlander on this year's market, but pitchers such as Matt Harvey and Tyson Ross could be options for the A's.\"We explored a little bit of everything. Position players, starters, and relievers,\" Forst said. \"I think we'll continue to monitor the club and figure out where the best fit is.\"Don't expect top prospect Jesus Luzardo to make an appearance in Oakland this season. Though he's been utterly dominant this season, set to get moved up to Triple-A after starting out the year at High-A Stockton, Forst said it's unlikely the A's will seriously consider him as a call up.\"It's not something we've discussed,\" Forst said. \"I don't rule anything out, but I don't expect him to be here.\"Luzardo, 20, has surprised the entire organization with his rapid progress. He's combined to go 9-4 with a 2.14 ERA in 18 starts at Single-A and Double-A this season with 109 strikeouts and just 22 walks over 88 1/3 innings pitched. The A's have placed the left-hander on an innings limit of 125 for the year.___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "350"}

Now, the Giants are 7.5 games out of first place and their highest-paid pitcher is awaiting a Sunday appointment with team doctors.\"I want to go out there like a warrior and give my best,\" Cueto said. \"I keep telling you guys and keep telling myself that I'm fine. But in reality I'm not. I just feel sad that I can't help. It's very difficult every time I go out there.\"The Giants signed Cueto before the 2016 season to keep their championship window open and build on the precedent set in the rotation by workhorses like Matt Cain and Ryan Vogelsong. After losing 98 games last season, the Giants are two games below .500 with two left to play before the July 31 trade deadline.Cain, Vogelsong and former closer Brian Wilson were honored with plaques on the Wall of Fame at AT&amp;T Park Saturday in a 90-minute ceremony that featured tributes and speeches from legendary figures within the organization.The celebration of three players who dominated opponents and pitched the Giants past every postseason competitor was a reminder of how they turned life with the Giants into success beyond their wildest dreams. But it made for a particularly brutal juxtaposition when Saturday's game started and Cueto felt miserable.\"I've got to be honest, sure there's concern there,\" manager Bruce Bochy said. \"For Johnny, we know how good he is and he's just not quite there.\"Cueto missed more than two months earlier this season following an elbow sprain he suffered at the end of April. The right-hander said he was nearly certain the injury would require Tommy John surgery, but after a visit to orthopedic surgeon Dr. James Andrews, Cueto opted to rest and recover.Since returning from the disabled list July 5, Cueto has allowed seven home runs and 16 earned runs in 21 innings. With pain continuing to limit his effectiveness, it's unclear when Cueto will make his next start and possible the Giants will consider shutting him down for the year.\"It's there, it's been about the same and it's holding ground I guess,\" Bochy said, when asked about Cueto's elbow pain. \"We're going to have to decide what we're going to do here.\"Dealing with injuries is a harsh reality for pitchers, and a feeling all three players honored before Saturday's game understand well.After closing out the 2010 World Series, Wilson underwent season-ending Tommy John surgery in 2012 and missed out on a chance to finish off the Detroit Tigers. Cain was a top starter on both the 2010 and 2012 title clubs, but he missed the 2014 postseason after undergoing surgery to remove bone spurs in his pitching elbow.Despite the time they missed, all three were leaders on pitching staffs that navigated the Giants through difficult postseasons. Though Cain, Vogelsong and Wilson can relate to the pain Cueto feels, it may be Cueto's turn to suffer through the reality he may not be healthy enough to pitch the Giants into contention.Wall of Fame criteria changingDuring Saturday's ceremony, Giants team president Larry Baer took the stage on King Street and announced the franchise has decided to amend the Wall of Fame requirements.With former reliever and three-time World Series champion Jeremy Affeldt joining other Giants legends on stage, Baer announced any player who wins three rings with the franchise will be honored on the wall.Baer's declaration clears the way for the Giants to honor the \"Core Four\" members of a bullpen that played pivotal roles for all three championship clubs and will allow Affeldt, Javier Lopez and Santiago Casilla to join their former teammates on the Wall of Fame in the future.The fourth member of the bullpen quartet that was part of all three title teams is Sergio Romo, who met the original criteria for inclusion by spending nine years with the franchise and earning an All-Star nod.___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "352"}
{"content": "Aug. 01--OAKLAND -- With a 6-2 win over the Toronto Blue Jays at the Oakland Coliseum Tuesday, the A's earned Melvin's 600th win as a manager. In doing so, Melvin became just the fourth A's skipper to reach the 600-win mark, joining Connie Mack (3582), Tony La Russa (798) and Art Howe (600).Regardless, Melvin wasn't planning to break out the expensive stuff to celebrate the milestone win.\"A bottle of mumm's when I go home,\" the A's skipper joked. \"I had no idea to tell you the truth. It's one more (win) than 599.\"The guys in Melvin's clubhouse saw the achievement in a different light.\"We're all happy for him,\" Mark Canha said after going 2 for 4 with a pair of doubles and an RBI. \"We all love that guy. He's our fearless leader. It's a pleasure to play for him.\"The A's allowed Melvin to reach the milestone by continuing the offensive assault they started with their 10-1 win over the Blue Jays Monday.Khris Davis led the charge at the plate, capping off a remarkable month of baseball by singling in the first, blasting his ninth home run of July in the third and ripping an RBI single in the sixth. Davis' 29 RBI are the second-most in July during the franchise's Oakland era behind the 35 runs brought in by Jose Canseco in 1991.While Davis' 29th homer landed a ways above the \"Holy Toledo\" sign in center, Melvin was more dazzled by his run-scoring single.\"What I'm most impressed by is the base hit single that drives in the sixth run,\" he said. \"You watch him take BP now and it's more of a hitter's BP. It's not necessarily just a power hitter's BP. He hits the other way in one continuous round and his bat control's gotten better and better since we've seen him here.\"He's drawing more walks. He's more dangerous.\"In addition to Davis' offense, Matt Olson went 2 for 4 with two RBI, bringing in Nick Martini and Matt Chapman with a single in the first.During their three-run third, the A's achieved a pair of uncommon feats on the same play. Semien and Canha pulled off a double steal, which included a swipe of home plate with Rickey Henderson present in the facility. Canha managed to sneak home after Luke Maile attempted to throw out Semien at second, sliding foot first under the catcher's tag. He said he's expecting compliments on his slide from baseball's all-time stolen base king.\"I went before (Maile) got rid of it,\" said Canha, who also stole home last season on a similar play. \"If he'd pulled that down and took a look at me, I would have been hosed.\"Chapman also participated in the 11-hit parade, doubling in the sixth after walking in the first, reaching base in a career-best 17th consecutive game. Chapman, who leads all defensive players in runs saved, also made a remarkable play in the field, chasing down a grounder with the shift on, pivoting, jumping and throwing out Aledmys Diaz as his momentum carried him toward foul territory in the eighth.Melvin called the Chapman's defense \"video game-ish,\" before suggesting that a video game probably \"hasn't seen that before.\"Starting pitcher Trevor Cahill appeared to agree.\"He just plays like his hair's on fire out there. He's all over the infield,\" the right-hander said. \"That play he made with the jump throw -- how he's able to make those throws like that off balance and it seems like they're always on the money, too.\"On a day when the A's failed to solidify their starting rotation by acquiring a starter before the nonwaiver trade deadline, Cahill (3-2) continued his dominance at the Oakland Coliseum in his 200th Major League start. He recovered from a rocky first in which he gave up a run off a double and a single, surrendering two earned runs off five hits and two walks over six innings.His only blemish after the opening frame was Justin Smoak's leadoff homer in the fourth.\"He battled,\" Melvin said. \"Early on, I'm not sure his command was as good as it normally is. He got better and better as he went along. The next thing you know he gets his six innings, and six innings makes it a lot easier on us.\"Despite the quality start, Cahill's home ERA jumped from 0.85 to 1.16 as he gave up just his fourth and fifth earned runs at the Coliseum this season.The win moved the A's to within a game of the Seattle Mariners for the second wild-card spot in the American League. They remain five games behind the Houston Astros for first place in the AL West standings.\"There's a lot of games left to be played,\" Melvin said. \"I don't think anything surprises the team with where we are right now. We're looking to do better things as we go along.\"___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "353"}
{"content": "NEW MILFORD \u2014 It\u2019s been more than a week since the town administration decided not to renew the police chief\u2019s contract \u2014 and questions remain about what led to the decision.  Was it because of officer turnover? A budgetary decision? A relatively new mayor\u2019s law enforcement philosophy?  No one knows for sure \u2014 or at least, no one is saying.  Mayor Pete Bass announced the decision not to renew Chief Shawn Boyne\u2019s contract earlier this month when someone accidentally posted the job position on the police department\u2019s web site.  Bass, who could not be reached for comments despite several attempts during the past week, took responsibility for the error but didn\u2019t give a reason for the move. He referred questions instead to human resources director Greg Bollaro, who also would not disclose what led to the decision.                              \u201cAt the end of the day, we were not able to come to terms with the contract,\u201d Bollaro said Monday. \u201cThe mayor wants to go in a new direction, but what that direction is I can\u2019t say until we have a candidate in place. But we have a lot of respect for the chief and he\u2019s done some great things with the department.\u201d  Boyne, who has previously served as a commander with the State Police and could also not be reached for comment Monday, had served as the town\u2019s chief for nearly eight years. His contract is set to expire in October.  \u201cThe chief was afforded the opportunity to work through the end of his contract,\u201d Bollaro said.    Boyne earned $122,000 last year; the chief\u2019s position is now advertised at a salary of $97,000 a year.  Town Council member Robert Muller said he is as much in the dark as the rest of the community, but would like to hear an explanation.  \u201cThe police chief is a very important position in town and if all of a sudden the contract is not getting renewed \u2014 that should be up for discussion and explained by the mayor and the director of personnel,\u201d he said.  Muller said he was surprised to hear that the chief\u2019s contract was not getting renewed, noting that there had been no discussion about the position during council meetings.  While Muller admits to missing the most recent meeting, nothing he said was mentioned on the council\u2019s agenda or within the minutes of the meeting.  \u201cFrom my perspective, when a chief is hired, that\u2019s an issue that\u2019s brought before the council, so in the same sense, if you are not renewing a contract, then the council should get the opportunity to weigh in on that decision,\u201d he said.  Muller said he would also like to hear more information on why 17 members of the police department, which has a total of 46 officers, have left within the past four years.  \u201cI would love to look at their exit interviews and see what they said on the way out,\u201d he said.  Wethersfield Police Chief James Cetran, who serves as president of the Connecticut Police Chief\u2019s Association, said to lose more than a third of your department in four years is certainly out of the norm.  \u201cThat\u2019s certainly quite a few officers to lose in just four years, but there could be a myriad of different reasons,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that is more than the normal turn over. It\u2019s not unheard of that a new politician comes to power and wants to change the philosophy. That often happens from the top.\u201d  Bass, who was sworn into in December, is serving the first of a two-year term. Boyne was hired by former Mayor Pat Murphy, who also renewed his contract four years ago.  Cetran, who has about 50 members in his department, said that if he lost 17 officers in recent years, he\u2019d probably have a \u201cheart attack.\u201d  \u201cIt can be a hard position to fill, and remember it takes more than 10 months of training before a new hire hits the streets,\u201d he said.  dperrefort@newstimes.com", "id": "354"}
{"content": "Aug. 03--Anthony Rizzo homered and went 3-for-4 Friday as the Cubs beat the Padres 5-4 at Wrigley Field to even the four-game series at a game apiece.Jose Quintana pitched six strong innings, allowing one run on four hits to register his 10th win in 17 decisions.Javier Baez and David Bote threw out runners at the plate in the eighth and ninth, respectively, to help save the day.Baez also homered and triple, pulling off his \"swim\" slide on the triple.\"I don't plan it,\" he said. \"I just react to it. I just switch my hands. I don't know how I do it, to be honest.\"The Cubs led 4-1 in the eighth when Steve Cishek fielded a grounder and threw the ball into center field for an error, allowing a run to score. Baez fielded a one-out grounder and nailed Kevin Jankowski at the plate. With the bases loaded and two out, newly acquired reliever Brandon Kintzler induced Christian Villanueva to line out to Bote at third, escaping the threat.Baez's eighth-inning triple led to a sacrifice fly by Ian Happ that made it 5-2, but Pedro Strop ran into trouble in the ninth.Strop gave up an RBI double to Cory Spangenberg to cut the lead to two runs and put the tying runs in scoring position. The Padres scored another run on an RBI groundout by Jankowski before Bote threw out Spangenberg at the plate on Manuel Margot's grounder.Strop then struck out Austin Hedges to end it, going into a gyrating, fist-pumping celebration on the mound.psullivan@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "355"}
{"content": "Aug. 02--SAN FRANCISCO -- \"My first reaction was to just smack him as hard as I could,\" Montana said, \"but when I looked at him in the eyes, I could tell he was serious. Of course, I graciously accepted.\"On Wednesday, the Hall of Fame quarterback stood at the lectern at Grace Cathedral in San Francisco and looked out at their former teammates, coaches and staff -- all graying or balding now -- who were part of the 49ers' legendary run of championships in the 1980s, a legacy that began with \"The Catch\" in 1981 that won the NFC championship against the Dallas Cowboys.\"The one thing he would always say to me, 'You know, they don't call it 'The Throw,' \" Montana deadpanned, as laughter from some 200 people attending Clark's memorial service rose up through the towering Gothic cathedral. \"So I will say, 'Yes, that's true, my friend, and I will catch you on the other side. I love you and I miss you and it was a pleasure having you in my life.'\"Perhaps no football player is more defined by a single play than Clark, who died June 4 at age 61 after a two-year battle with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis that weakened every limb. But on Wednesday, many remembered him for much more than that: his Southern charm, his courage, his loyalty, his humility, his sense of humor.\"Dwight had every gift but enough years on this earth,\" Eddie DeBartolo, the 49ers team owner during the glory years, told the crowd that filled the pews.There were hugs and tears and laughs among this family of men on Wednesday -- all who had received personal invitations to the private service -- including the great names of the era: Ronnie Lott, Jerry Rice, Steve Young, Roger Craig.Some of them, including Dan Audick and Charlie Young, remember every little detail about their contribution to \"The Catch.\" For them, it's a badge of honor to have been on the field.\"I was in the drive that led to the catch,\" said Audick, whose No. 61 jersey is visible in the famous photo of that moment as Clark pulls in the ball by the fingertips. \"I remember the whole essence of the series of plays.\"In the midst of the service, everyone who had been part of the team was invited to the front of the church, and while \"The Morning Trumpet\" was sung by the Cathedral Choir, the line of players and coaches and executives extended nearly to the stained glass windows on each side.There was also an acknowledgment of what the 49ers meant to San Francisco in the 1980s, when the city was in the midst of the AIDS epidemic and recovering from the tragedies of the People's Temple mass suicide in Jonestown, Guyana, and the assassinations of Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk.\"We were in a real downer time. It was darkness and gloom,\" said Frank Jordan, San Francisco's mayor in the 1990s and former police chief, who had also come to pay his respects. \"And all of a sudden came a team, we had something we could look up to. It gave us a burst of euphoria we hadn't seen.\"With Clark's catch, a leaping, fingertip clutch high in the end zone with 51 seconds left in the game, \"everyone in San Francisco felt united, exhilarated and 10-feet tall,\" Jordan said.Clark's widow, Kelly, sat in the front row and other dignitaries filled in, including former general manager Carmen Policy, current 49ers CEO Jed York, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown and San Francisco Rep. Nancy Pelosi.Some of the stories shared from the lectern -- or in smaller gatherings outside -- had the feel of a lively locker room. The players called Clark \"Hercules\" for his rugged good looks, or \"Tarzan\" for his animated yells after games. They joked that he was a \"Joe Namath wannabe\" for famously wearing a coyote fur coat during the first Super Bowl parade.Montana, who was drafted in 1979 with Clark, said watching his ex-teammate \"kind of dwindle away and become a shadow of himself,\" was painful. \"I tried to make him laugh as much as I could,\" Montana said.During training camp one season, he remembered the two of them -- as a prank -- locking up all the players' bikes with a giant chain. When Montana suffered a concussion during an away-game and couldn't return home immediately, Clark \"asked if he could stay and make sure I was OK.\"\"I think he found out he we were staying at the Waldorf and staying in Mr. DeBartolo's suite,\" Montana added. \"Maybe he was looking for a free meal.\"At a reception later, Huey Lewis, a San Francisco rock legend whose 1980s hits became the soundtrack for the 49ers golden age, told the story of inviting Montana, Lott and Clark to join him for a recording session of \"Hip to Be Square.\" Anyone who listens to the recording, Lewis said, will hear Dwight's voice in the final lyric, singing 'hip to be square.\"\"I should have had him sing more of the song because he sung it better than I did,\" Lewis said.Perhaps the most emotional speech came from DeBartolo, who took a deep breath before he began. Famous for taking care of his players in sickness and in health, DeBartolo was 32 when he took over the 49ers. He asked Clark and Montana to consider him a big brother and call him Eddie, but \"Dwight always insisted on calling me 'Boss.' \"He told the story of negotiating the contracts of both players at his home in Youngstown, Ohio, without their agents. Carmen Policy, who was the team president, \"didn't like the idea, but went along with it,\" he said.\"That night, Dwight, Joe and I shot pool and drank Tequila -- probably way more than we should have,\" DeBartolo said. \"Well, I got the deals done.\"At breakfast the next morning, DeBartolo told Policy he was paying Montana $1 million and Clark $500,000. When Policy asked, \"What happened? All I could say was, 'they won.' \"\"Then Carmen's jaw dropped when he saw Dwight drive off to Carolina in my brand new silver Ferrari,\" he said.DeBartolo keeps a picture of \"The Catch\" twosome at his Montana ranch. Montana signed it, \"Thanks a million,\" and Clark signed it \"Thanks a half million.\"At the ranch, DeBartolo set up the actual Candlestick Park goal post that backdropped \"The Catch.\" As Clark's life neared its end, DeBartolo invited Clark's closest teammates and friends to gather with him at the ranch and share memories. Clark wheeled himself out of the barn to the goal posts where they gathered for a final photo.His ashes are buried there now, several feet from the goal posts, about the location where he had made his infamous play. A headstone marks the spot with an inscription that reads \"The dynasty began with you.\"\"I'm so thankful I have so many moments he left me to cherish,\" DeBartolo said. \"How many of us can say that our best moments were as magnificent as his?\"Although Clark \"left all of us way too soon,\" DeBartolo ended, \"I know that Dwight was ready to soar again. This time he touched the heavens.\"___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "356"}
{"content": "Here are three reasons why the Philadelphia Eagles not playing in the 2018 Hall of Fame game is a blessing in the long run.After months of waiting and being patient, football fans will finally be able to enjoy an actual game Thursday night, as the Chicago Bears and Baltimore Ravens are set to square off in the 2018 Pro Football Hall of Fame. Despite seeing two of their former star players in Brian Dawkins and Terrell Owens finally earning their spots in Canton, some football fans may seem surprised to see the Philadelphia Eagles absent from participating in this first preseason game.However, the argument can be made that not appearing in the annual game has its benefits for the Eagles, as the defending champions will wait until the following Thursday to kick off their preseason at home against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Obviously, key Philadelphia players and fans will be tuning in for the festivities this weekend, especially when taking into consideration that Dawkins was an administrator for the team over the last couple of seasons, including last year\u2019s Super Bowl run.Waiting an extra week to get the first preseason game isn\u2019t the worst thing in the world for the Eagles since next Thursday will be here before they know it, even if Doug Pederson ends up limiting the starters.As for the Hall of Fame Game, here are three reasons why Philadelphia as a team should consider themselves lucky for not having to participate in the game since it has plenty of advantages working in their favor. Not to mention, isn\u2019t the most important factor overall that football is finally back after all these months?", "id": "357"}
{"content": "Aug. 01--Have you ever felt stuck in a relationship that went sour or trapped in a job that no longer rewards you but you just can't seem to quit? Meet the sunk cost effect. This is the same reason we have trouble getting rid of clothes we no longer wear or moving out of places we used to love that now drive us crazy (looking at you, Bay Area).A new paper published in the journal Psychological Science explores our tendency to stay all in on a botched plan even when it flies in the face of rational decision making. Why do we insist on throwing good money (or time) after bad?\"The sunk cost effect is the general tendency for people to continue an endeavor, or continue consuming or pursuing an option, if they've invested time or money or some resource in it,\" Christopher Olivola, an assistant professor of marketing at Carnegie Mellon's Tepper School of Business tells Time. \"That effect becomes a fallacy if it's pushing you to do things that are making you unhappy or worse off.\"One of the reasons we get snared in this psychological trap may be because we hate experiencing regret and admitting that we messed up, experts suggest. Sticking with the plan, even when it no longer works, is a way to avoid cognitive dissonance: the mental disconnect between paying for something and not getting the expected return on investment, Olivola tells Time.\"After we commit, we humans tend to shackle ourselves to our own decisions,\" as Smithsonian Magazine puts it.The sunk cost fallacy might also be a self-defense mechanism, a way to reinforce our confidence in the effort we've already put in--basically, a way to save face with ourselves, as University of Minnesota neuroscientist Brian Sweis told Smithsonian.Bad romance is an iconic example of \"sunk cost\" thinking. Sometimes people chain themselves to an unhappy relationship just because they've already wasted so much time on it. If they cut and run, they will have to face the failure.\"Romantic relationships are a classic one,\" Olivola says. \"The longer you've been together, the harder it is to break up.\"One of the most fascinating aspects of this tendency to stick with the plan, even when it's a total bomb, is that it appears to happen in other species, such as mice and rats as the University of Minnesota has studied. Like us, they have a hard time walking away from something once they have invested too much time in it.As Alex Kacelnik, a behavioral ecologist at the University of Oxford, told the Scientific American: \"If you find that one species makes a systematically bad choice, you can argue it's an accident of history. But if you find a very different species does the same thing--then, come on, there must be some reason why evolution doesn't eliminate this form of behavior.\"Perhaps the most compelling reason to study the \"sunk cost\" phenomena is to be able to catch ourselves when we are unwittingly succumbing to it, despite our best interests. It might help us let go of whatever is holding us back.\"What's done is done,\" as Olivola puts it. \"There's nothing you can do to regain money that's lost -- and pursuing something that makes you unhappy not only isn't going to get your money back, but it's also going to make you worse off. You're just digging a deeper hole.\"___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "358"}
{"content": "July 26--The Bears returned to practice Thursday morning after Wednesday's day off. Not only were they back in pads, they also tackled to the ground during two sessions for the first time this year.\"Live (tackling) is great for the run game, and then it's also good for the perimeter-type runs and passes to see how your corners and safeties come up and tackle,\" coach Matt Nagy said.\"And there's no excuse. If I get trucked, it wasn't that it was 'thud' (period) and I wasn't ready. If I get trucked, it's: I knew that it was live, and I got beat one on one.\"Here are five observations from Thursday's practice. Remember, these are just snapshots of players' attempts to try new things and work on techniques while they try to master the offensive and defensive schemes.1. Quarterback Mitch Trubisky has been intercepted in all three of the Bears' padded practices.On Thursday, veteran cornerback Prince Amukamara got him twice in quick succession during seven-on-seven drills. One of them resulted from an off-target throw for Kevin White that was tipped.\"Mitch had a couple interceptions today,\" Nagy acknowledged. \"The best part of that was he came back with a completion on the next play. So we're growing in that process. He's testing the waters along with the other quarterbacks.\"Trubisky continues to chase consistency. A pair of deep throws to running back/wide receiver Tarik Cohen exemplified this. Early in 11-on-11, he hit Cohen in stride down the right sideline, with linebacker Nick Kwiatkoski close in coverage. Later, though, his incomplete deep post to Cohen was overthrown, and Cohen was covered, anyway, by cornerback Bryce Callahan.Of course, Trubisky isn't going to hit all of his throws, and training camp is the time to figure out what he can complete.In the live tackling red-zone session, Trubisky threw a perfect fade to Adam Shaheen for a touchdown. The ball was high and outside the defender where only Shaheen could catch it, and the big tight end reminded us why he's such a red-zone threat.One last scribbled line in the notebook: Trubisky rushed through a gaping hole on a zone-read keeper, the type of play the Chiefs had in their playbook for quarterback Alex Smith and the Bears had in for Trubisky last season. Trubisky's read and decision-making will always be a point of focus on those plays, and he got that one correct.2. Anthony Miller showed off his strong hands on a touchdown grab and another highlight-reel catch, part of a standout practice for the second-round rookie slot receiver.He's steadily building a case to be the Bears starting slot receiver for Week 1, although that distinction probably carries less weight when considering how much Nagy moves receivers around and shuffles personnel groupings.Miller's touchdown was a fade that he caught above his head. The other catch was a spectacular leaping grab that he snatched off the back of cornerback Marcus Cooper's head. Cooper was face-guarding him near the left sideline.On both receptions, Miller secured the ball away from his body. Phil Savage, former Ravens director of player personnel and Browns general manager, described Miller's hands as \"sticky\" in a tweet after he attended practice.\"It's a really big part of my game; you've got to have strong hands,\" Miller said. \"Especially at this level, there's going to be a lot of traffic catches with a lot of guys around you. You've got to be able to catch it away from your body.\"To help his hands, Miller sometimes squeezes grip strengtheners when he's sitting around. And he kneads rice in a bucket in the Bears training room.As for the fade, it wasn't a high throw that enabled Miller to show off his hops. Instead, he won the ball with good body position.\"You want to make sure you get your position, first of all, either parallel or in front of him,\" Miller said. \"And then you want to stack him so (that) you have position over the ball when it comes over you.\"His rushing touchdown was an example of how the Bears' speedy receivers can threaten defenses on the perimeter. It's a dimension to the running game that opens all sorts of misdirection and options too.3. For rookie sixth-round draft pick Kylie Fitts to seize his opportunity to earn time in the outside linebacker rotation, he must prove he can effectively rush the passer.The Bears liked him in the draft mostly as a run stopper. As a pass rusher, they considered him to have upside. Refining his pass-rush techniques in camp is his path to the field, especially because the Bears can't count on Aaron Lynch (hamstring), who's injured for the third time since mid-April.Fitts, in one-on-one pass-rush drills Thursday, used his right arm -- and only his right arm -- to push back tackle Rashaad Coward.The move is called, appropriately enough, the \"long arm.\" Fitts never used it at Utah, but Bears outside linebackers coach Brandon Staley is big on it, Fitts said.\"Rookie camp, OTAs, I've just been trying to work on the long arm,\" Fitts said. \"You're a lot longer that way than with two arms. There are so many things that can come from that. You can chop. You can snatch them by. You can keep powering through.\"Fitts' work with the move centers on timing and hand placement on the offensive lineman. It's especially effective if the blocker's hands are down. And placement in the chest area is of the utmost importance.\"If he's over-setting, now I want to go inside (part of his chest),\" Fitts said. \"If kind of short in setting, I want to go outside.\"Those are all very quick reads and movements. Fitts prepares himself by watching Bears offensive linemen's movements and tendencies on video.\"It's a lot to learn,\" he said.4. Safety Eddie Jackson stopped a run for no gain during the live tackling period.He appeared to fit his gap perfectly by coming downhill aggressively and meeting the second-string running back in the hole.On a defense with so many known quantities, Jackson is one of the more intriguing prospects.The Bears need him to make his biggest impact in pass defense, particularly in forcing turnovers. But he's mindful of how important run defense is to what he offers the team.He came to the Bears last season with questions about his tackling, which were acknowledged by Alabama coach Nick Saban. Jackson was intent on improving his angles, and there were signs of progress amid growing pains throughout his rookie season.He appears fully willing to tackle and be physical, which is an important component of playing safety. Jackson told reporters July 22 that he put on weight in the offseason, although he didn't say how much or what he weighs now. He appears fuller than his wiry frame from last season.5. Undrafted rookie Ryan Nall's 30-yard touchdown run featured a hesitation move that made cornerback Jonathon Mincy miss in space.Nall is worth keeping an eye on in the second half of exhibition games next month. The Bears really like the undrafted rookie from Oregon State because he does many things well. This could help him sneak onto the 53-man roster as the fourth running back or at least hang around on the practice squad as injury insurance at the running back position.On his touchdown in live-tackling drills, he changed his pace as he reached the second level, and Mincy whiffed when Nall cut back.At 6-foot-2, and 232 pounds, Nall moves relatively well. On one carry in live tackling team drills, he adjusted his path behind the line of scrimmage without breaking stride or slowing down, demonstrating good vision and nimble feet.\"The nice thing with Ryan is that he's versatile in that he can run the ball, block, go out and run routes, can do different things,\" Nagy said. \"So, being a rookie coming in here as an undrafted free agent, he's done really well. We were excited to get the pads on him, and you saw in the live period that he was making plays.\"rcampbell@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "359"}
{"content": "An aggressive new move by real estate database giant Zillow aims to streamline the process by which millions of people find housing by integrating rental application functions into its most popular apps. The new tools will allow people looking to rent houses or apartments to complete a rental application and file background and credit checks on the fly, under the umbrella of a single application fee.The new tools, which will also enable renters to pay their rent directly to Zillow, could potentially disrupt the multi-billion secondary services market for companies that process the rental application market and rent payments. But Zillow says it\u2019s simply responding to the majority of renters it recently surveyed for the upcoming 2018 Zillow Group Consumer Housing Trends Report. The new survey found that most apartment dwellers have less than three months to find housing, so streamlining the process could be a huge improvement.\u201cRenters tell us they want the entire rental process to happen online, from search to application to payment,\u201d Zillow President Jeremy Wacksman said in a statement. \u201cHowever, most landlords don\u2019t have the resources to offer these services. We\u2019re excited to provide the technology to help renters and landlords have a better experience.\u201dThe tools will allow renters to engage with potential landlords through three of its most popular sites, Zillow, Trulia, and HotPads, to apply for multiple apartments through one all-encompassing application for a flat fee of $29, allowing users to send applications to as many properties that they want (that accept Zillow\u2019s application structure) during a 30-day period. That\u2019s a pretty dramatic shift for a rental market that is typically forced to pay application and background check fees of $50 to $100 per property, usually three or four times in a given search period. One real estate market that misses out on the new bells and whistles for the moment is New York City, where Zillow\u2019s StreetEasy platform is popular with those seeking housing in a dense urban center.Zillow hasn\u2019t built all the functions of its new toolbox from scratch, though. The real estate giant partnered with Checkr to handle background checks and eviction histories as well as Experian to process credit reports. Zillow will also accept rental payments directly from tenants, passing on those potential billions of dollars back to landlords via the existing Zillow Rental Manager. Zillow says it isn\u2019t charging landlords for any of these new services.It\u2019s a massive move into the property management services market for Zillow and follows hot on the heels of the launch of Zillow Offers, a new prototype service recently opened in Denver that allows home seekers to make cash offers for homes. The service is also currently available in the real estate hotspots Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Atlanta.", "id": "360"}

{"content": "July 30--Reliever Jesse Chavez returns Tuesday to PNC Park, where his 11-year major-league career began with a perfect inning of relief against the Cubs. Chavez's nine-team odyssey included one curious trade deadline detour eight years ago.\"I was walking from the visitor's clubhouse to the bullpen in Cincinnati,\" recalled Chavez, believing at the time he would stay with the Braves with the deadline minutes away. \"I was literally behind home plate as the umpires were convening (for the lineup card exchange).\"Then I was called back and told I was traded to the Royals.\"But Chavez won't need to worry about a similar occurrence this season after making a favorable impression in the short time he has been with the Cubs since arriving in a trade from the Rangers on July 19.\"He knows what he's doing,\" manager Joe Maddon said Saturday after Chavez pitched his fifth consecutive scoreless outing.\"He's very resilient. He's an interesting add.\"Chavez immediately established his value: He pitched two scoreless innings to preserve a 7-2 victory in his Cubs debut on July 21, and he pitched a scoreless sixth that allowed the Cubs to rally from a 6-1 deficit to a 7-6 walk-off win over the Diamondbacks on Thursday.\"He's got a slow heartbeat,\" said Cubs special assistant David Ross, who played with Chavez with the Braves in 2010. \"He leads by example. He knows how to pitch and have a good time.\"Right fielder Jason Heyward, who was a rookie when he played with Ross and Chavez, added that Chavez has \"withstood the test of time.\"\"There's a guy who started, relieved, started, and now relieved,\" Heyward said. \"To me, that embodies how he can figure how to help a team win in any role.\"In the last eight seasons, Chavez has persevered by pitching aggressively, staying healthy and polishing four pitches -- particularly a changeup -- that more than compensated for a blazing fastball.Although Chavez was surprised by his recent trade, he was pleased he was dealt well in advance of Tuesday's deadline.\"I've been on teams that have been on the fire sale side, and I think it's beneficial to get it out of the way for a player to get there, get to know the team, before it gets to crush time,\" Chavez said.\"The earlier you get to a new team, the better the acclimation you can make to the club -- from the catchers, scouting staff, pitching coaches, the manager. It goes down the line from the players to the clubhouse guys, getting them comfortable with you and their well-being, and help you in your own element. They want you to be comfortable.\"With all the moving Chavez has experienced, providing support for his family is just as essential. His family accompanied him from Texas after the trade and will stay with him through next weekend's home series before they return to Riverside, Calif.Chavez's daughter Christe will start freshman orientation next week at Riverside Poly High School.But Chavez has no intention of retiring, especially with his continued effectiveness and his services in demand.\"As long as I'm healthy, I do all I can to stay out of that trainer's room,\" said Chavez, who has pitched in 338 games -- including 70 starts. \"As long as I can do that, I don't see why I should hang them up.

{"content": "July 30--First-round draft pick. Defensive Rookie of the Year. Eight-time Pro Bowl selection. NFC champion. Soon, an official member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame.After a stellar 13-year career with the Bears, Brian Urlacher's legacy is defined not only by his personal accomplishments but also by the impact he had on teammates, coaches and others associated with the organization.Urlacher's official Hall of Fame enshrinement will come next weekend in Canton, Ohio, a landmark moment that will put him in the most elite football company there is.Urlacher will be presented at the induction ceremony by former Bears defensive coordinator Bob Babich. And he will be celebrated by a legion of Bears supporters, including those who spent considerable time with him at Halas Hall, at Soldier Field and in stadiums around the NFL.The Tribune recently caught up with those who knew Urlacher best. These are their memories.Thomas Jones (Bears running back, 2004-06): In the locker room, he was hilarious. We were a very, very close team in Chicago. Like brothers, like a family. We were together all the time. And 'Lach was one of the ringleaders. We had this game where we had this ball made out of the tape that you wrap your ankles with and we'd shoot this huge ball into the laundry basket. Guys would get crazy. Double or nothing. You name it. It turned into this whole event at lunchtime. And 'Lach was the main ringleader. It would piss (equipment manager) Tony Medlin off because he's trying to get clothes out of the laundry basket and as he's standing there he's ducking as this big ball comes flying at the basket. And Brian was the ringleader of all of this. That was 'Lach. On the field, he was always goofing around. Stuffing grass in people's helmets. It was like you took kids from Pop Warner and you fast-forwarded 20 years later and they were doing the exact same things. That's why people loved him so much. Because as big of a star as Brian was, he was one of the most humble guys you'll ever meet. And he was very, very approachable. ... Brian just had this mystique, man. A presence. It was a quiet confidence. He never bragged. He never talked about himself. He was a big kid. All he did was laugh and joke around. And even in practice, he was still always happy-go-lucky. So I never really saw that other side of him until game time. And then it was like he became another person. I don't know, man. It was like he got this crazy mean streak about him. I was like that in practice. Everything I did was intense. I didn't know how to do anything different. Out on the field, in the weight room, watching film, everything I did was very intense and serious. No games. But then you see someone like Brian who is playing at such a high level. He's literally chasing down quarterbacks, chasing down running backs, knocking the crap out of fullbacks and linemen. Always around the ball. Always making plays. And it was crazy to see him go from being this happy-go-lucky guy who is always laughing and joking and then he turns into this kind of savage of a player. It was like a magic trick.Olin Kreutz (Bears center, 1998-2010): Have you ever heard the story of his first play live at middle linebacker in practice? So Barry Minter is hurt and Brian wasn't exactly setting the world on fire at SAM (linebacker). They had him on the line and they were trying him there and no one was overly impressed. You could see in practice his athleticism, but at SAM it wasn't amazing and Barry Minter was here and everybody loved Barry. He was a good leader and steady and right at the end of his career.So they put Urlacher at middle linebacker and in those days, I am not saying I was great, but when there was outside zone, linebackers were easy for me and I cut them off in a second. So I jump out and try to cut off 'Lach on that first play and he just (absolutely) flies. I came back to the huddle and I was like, \"(Wow!) That guy is fast! Leave him there.\" That was my third year and I wasn't great, but I was pretty damn good by then and I jumped out there like, \"This is my block. I'm going to kill this guy.\" He just flew by me big and strong and fast and I don't know if I've ever seen anything quite like that.Obviously, he ends up being a first-ballot Hall of Fame guy and now, yeah, looking back that is how good he was, but at the time I was like, \"(Wow!) I've never seen anything like that.\" I don't think 'Lach even knew how fast he was at that time. If you could imagine the first time playing MIKE and you designed something and said, \"What would Brian Urlacher be really good at?\" Well, it would be chasing down the outside zone. He did that and there wasn't a linebacker I played against -- Pro Bowl, All-Pro at that time -- that I wasn't cutting off with ease and 'Lach's speed was on a whole other level.Lovie Smith (Bears head coach, 2004-12, on Urlacher's 25 tackles and tide-turning forced fumble during the Bears' legendary 24-23 win over the Cardinals on \"Monday Night Football\" in 2006): Brian Urlacher comes over right at that intermission (before the fourth quarter). And I grabbed Brian and I looked at him with a smile and I said, \"Hey, Brian. You know it's time now, right? What are you waiting for? We're running out of time. If we're going to do something, we need to do it pretty quick.\" Brian and I are just casually talking. It's not like I'm chewing him out. I was just trying to loosen him up and get him going. So I said, \"You're freaking Brian Urlacher. You need to make something happen right now.\" And Brian did. ... For Brian to yank the ball out, he's tearing the ball from a great player's hands (in Edgerrin James). And then, where have we heard this before? Charles Tillman involved with a takeaway? And scoring a touchdown? We've seen and heard that many times. ... Brian was everything you want a linebacker to be. First off, that leader. The voice. The guy who's out front. He's an imposing figure. Every play, they see a 6-4, 260-pound, 6 percent body-fat guy in front of you. ... And Brian was a guy who knew what everybody was supposed to do. You expect that guy, in big games, to come through. If we needed him to make a big hit, he did that time after time. Stripped the ball. You expected that out of a first-ballot Hall of Famer. The Chicago Bears should have a player like that. And they did.George McCaskey (owner and team chairman): Wow. Where do you start? Twenty-five tackles in the \"Crown their ass\" game (against the Cardinals in 2006). There he is ripping the ball away. Peanut (Tillman) picks it up and scores. I also think about his 90-yard fumble return in Atlanta (in 2001). He looks like he's having a conversation with the entire Falcons bench as he's running down their sideline. But I can tell you this: My favorite Brian memory is not on the field at all. We had this ticket donation program with the players, which is now called \"Home Team Hand-Off.\" It was more informal back then. My assistant in the ticket office was Kendra Maher. ... Brian would go to her and tell her, \"You tell me how many you need me to buy. And you decide who's getting the benefit and I'll take care of it.\" He didn't want anybody to know about it. He'd probably be mad at me for telling you this. But that was his generosity.Those tickets would go to so many various charities -- Midtown Educational Association, Special Olympics Illinois and a whole host of other organizations. The program continues to this day. But Brian was the one who really propped it up. That told me that he was incredibly generous, that he didn't want anyone to know about it, that he does the right thing when people aren't looking. He gets it. That's what being a leader and being a Bear means.Tony Parrish (Bears safety, 1998-2001): Right away, you could tell Brian was a phenomenal athlete when he first arrived. But he was kind of like a 'Slash.' He played a few different positions early on -- SAM and the WILL spot. And then Greg Blache put him in the middle. We had those two mountains up front in Ted Washington and Keith Traylor with Brian right behind them. And that story ends with the yellow jacket on Brian's back. ... I also remember coming back to the huddle and during timeouts, Brian would be singing just about every song they were playing in the stadium. All the time. On the field. And it seemed like he knew all the lyrics to all the songs. Didn't matter what genre. He was just having fun the whole time.And I also remember after games sitting next to Mike Brown and saying, \"How many tackles did you get today?\" Because it was just like a race. We were racing just to get a piece of something because the rest of that defense was just so strong. And Brian was at the forefront of that. Mike and I were basically running around and jumping on piles pretty much. That was our running joke.Greg Blache (Bears defensive coordinator, 1999-2003): What always impressed me was how smart he was. Brian had football savvy right away that a lot of young guys couldn't ever dream about. The only guy I ever put in that ballpark with him was Mike Brown. As far as football sense was concerned, those were two of the best I have ever been around. That was such an added plus. We just had to make certain we took him along and didn't get him hurt as we were going through the process of making him a middle linebacker. ... Our plan was to eventually move him to middle linebacker regardless. He actually started his first game for us as a nickel 'backer. We put him at middle linebacker in the nickel because he didn't have to run in traffic. You get a guy who's 6-5 and he has played safety (in college) and you throw him in the middle with all those bodies, you're asking for disaster. So we started him off at SAM, where all the traffic came from one direction. Even though you're on the line of scrimmage, it was from one direction. He had always played 15 yards off the ball and ran to the ball. He didn't have to take people on. And so that was a concern. Getting him through the adjustment physically of being up front, in the mix, with all the big guys. He took to it well. ... We started him off that first year at SAM behind Rosie (Colvin). Brian worked hard and he was embarrassed when he was not named the starter. He didn't even go home and tell his family. Because he was that much of a competitor. I talked to him and said, \"Brian, you're going to be our guy. There is no doubt in our mind. But it would be stupid for us to put you in situations that are dangerous for you.\" A lot of people say he should have started day one. But if he had torn his knee up, he would have been another one of those statistics of great first-rounders who got hurt and never, ever materialized. In reality, we're sitting here talking about a guy going into the Hall of Fame. Getting a jacket.Lance Briggs (Bears linebacker, 2003-14): When I first got to the Bears, I hardly said I word. I kept my head down and just focused on my play. Brian brought me into the group and made me part of it. That's just the way he was with the defense and in the locker room. We had a lot of fun, and Coach Lovie allowed us to because we were sharp on the field. We loved playing together and being together, and that started with Brian. I eventually earned a spot in the starting 11 and we were able to develop a partnership that was just special.I remember the first game in 2005 against the Redskins. Brian was flying around. He made one (play), and I remember saying to myself, \"Man, he's going to win defensive player of the year this year.\" And, sure enough, he did!Tony Medlin (Bears equipment manager, 1987-present): When we were playing the Green Bay Packers on Dec. 23, 2007, Brian ran an 85-yard pick-six versus Brett Favre. We won that game 35-7. That was one of the greatest moments when you say Brian Urlacher. I remember when he ran across that goal line, he was just huffing and puffing. (Laughs) He came back and everybody started laughing. He really was shaking his head at how tired he was. That's a big one for me because when you've got a chance to beat Green Bay or you get a chance to intercept one of the greatest players in NFL history in Brett Favre, that's a big statement. You had Hall of Famer versus Hall of Famer. You didn't know it at the time, but you knew at some point they'd get that way.Jeff Joniak (Bears radio play-by-play announcer, 2001-present): Few players I have come across in my career loved the game more -- and I mean the day-to-day grind. He loved everything. Loved being on the field with his teammates. Loved practice. Loved the locker room and the fun they had in there. He knew the defense cold, knew everyone's responsibilities and ran the show. Not one guy I have ever spoken to didn't say the same thing about Brian. He ferociously supported every teammate and would do anything for anybody at any time. From the time he walked into the building, he was a positive. He competed every day and loved his job.I will never forget early in his career. Brett Favre rolled out to his right and was chased down from behind. And I remember Favre got up and turned his head, stunned that he was tackled -- and it was Brian. That mental speed and instinctiveness served him well. It was an honor to call his games, an honor to call the career of a Hall of Fame middle linebacker who made so many big plays. I have too many favorites to list. The comeback in Arizona was a trademark game. He was a sideline-to-sideline nightmare for the Cardinals in that game: 19 tackles, three hits on the QB, three stuffs, one forced fumble and two pass breakups. Incredible day. Incredible player.Matt Forte (Bears running back, 2008-15): Me being a rookie coming in, I look across the defense before my first carry at camp, and there was Brian Urlacher, Lance Briggs, Tommie Harris, Peanut Tillman, Mike Brown -- the whole Super Bowl defense. The first play, Brian called out the play. Like, \"It's coming right here!\" I'm thinking to myself, \"If he knows where the play is going, how are we going to run the play?\" Needless to say, he was right there to make the play too. Playing against a defense like that (as) a young rookie groomed me to know that I just arrived here and that I hadn't made it.Todd Johnson (Bears safety, 2003-2006): In 2013, shortly after I became the head coach of Riverview High School (in Sarasota, Fla.), I reached out to Brian and he was more than willing to help. He didn't hesitate. He said, \"What can I do to help you?\" I told him we were in need of new uniforms at our school and he said, \"Consider it done.\" We got it done. We were struggling. We hadn't gotten new uniforms in a long time and we were having to mix and match a little bit and piece some stuff together. We had over 60 kids on our varsity team at the time and this was a necessity. This wasn't just wanting to look cool. The kids were fired up when they learned they came from Brian Urlacher. It made me a pretty cool coach, but they were super excited and shocked he was the one that facilitated it and got it done.James \"Big Cat\" Williams (Bears lineman, 1991-02): The first time we saw him at practice, being out on the field, they put him in at outside linebacker. I think we ran a sweep play. It was myself and (guard) Chris Villarrial. We teamed up to (block) Urlacher, and we missed him. We got back to the huddle and talked amongst ourselves, and we couldn't figure it out. We were like, \"Damn, that dude is fast as hell.\"So we go back in and look at film. Come to find out, dude had taken three steps in the wrong direction and was fast enough to still beat us over the top. We were like, \"Dude, we are in some trrrooouuuubbbbbble. We might have to make some adjustments.\" (Laughs) You could tell when he first hit the field that he was going to be something special.Patrick Mannelly (Bears long snapper, 1998-2013): I have two stories. One is on the field, one is off the field. My No. 1 story is that, you know, he was sponsored by Nike. He would go through shoes all the time at practice and then have them in his locker. Him being who he was, when you went to ask him for an autograph for a (charity) auction item or something like that, he would say, \"Is this a big event?\" I'd be like, \"Yeah, yeah.\" He'd be like, \"Oh, let me get you a pair of shoes, and I'll sign the shoes because it's something different\" instead of a piece of paper or photo or football. He went out of his way to think about his teammates and help charity and think, \"How can I make it different?\" I would show up to these events or sent stuff off -- Brian's signed shoes -- and they're like, \"Oh my god, this is awesome!\" They would raise so much money because it was something different. But that's Brian and who he was as a teammate, thinking about what he could do to help out. That kind of sums him up that he was such a great guy, a great teammate. I probably got 10 pairs of his shoes over my career.On the field, I just remember -- it had to be his first year -- it was up in Green Bay. Favre is rolling out to his right, coming toward our bench. Favre ... looks over his left shoulder and thinks he has an extra second. He takes that little half-second pump to try to throw something in there, and the next thing you know his face is right in the turf. It was Urlacher chasing him, and I think that was a moment when he was like, \"Oh, crap, this dude is for real. He's got a different gear, and I really have got to worry about this guy.\" I think us as a team and teammates were like, \"All right, we've got something special.\"Greg Gabriel (former Bears director of college scouting, current football analyst): It goes back to late December 2001, our first season here. The final game was in Detroit. Being that I lived in Buffalo, I flew home to get my kids and drove to Detroit so they could see the Bears play. My kids were like 12, 13 years old, and so obviously in awe of pro football players. Brian saw me in the lobby with the girls, came over and said hello, said, \"Are these your kids?\" He went out of his way to be nice and be friendly and say hello to the kids and me. It's little stuff like that that jumped out at me about Brian Urlacher the person. I could think of all of the times you'd be in the weight room working out, and he'd come up and (say), \"Hey, how're you doing? How's your family doing?\" I just think he's a quality person on top of being a great athlete. Brian ... was a pretty humble guy and raised right, so I think a lot of it has to do with that. He knew where he came from.(On the field), part of the reason he became the great player he did become was really bringing in Lovie and putting him in that defense. He was the perfect player for that scheme. Before Lovie came here, his ideal linebacker was really the WILL linebacker, and we had a great one too in Lance Briggs, but because of Brian, he put a lot more onus then on what the middle linebacker could do. That marriage of Lovie and Brian actually made Brian's career turn to be out the way it did.He made things look easy. He wasn't the greatest pass rusher, but what he could do -- and part of it was he played safety in college -- is he could drop into zone and take away the whole center of the field because of his ability to play zone coverage. A lot of that underneath stuff across the middle, you couldn't do it with Brian Urlacher on the field.Dan Pompei (sportswriter, formerly of the Tribune; presented Urlacher's case to Hall of Fame voters): Michael Vick came into the league in 2001, and he could not be stopped. It looked like he was playing a different game from everyone else in terms of his speed. No one could chase him and catch him. And then the Bears played him, and Urlacher just chased him all over the field, ran him down, kept hitting him the whole game, ended up with eight tackles, an interception, a forced fumble, a recovered fumble and he scored a touchdown. It was really an eye-opener about the kind of athleticism this guy had at playing at over 250 pounds, that he could chase this incredible, one-of-a-kind quarterback all over the field and not only match his speed or exceed his speed but beat him up physically to the point where he basically defeated him. The Bears won that game, and Urlacher ended up 5-0 in his career against Vick. I've talked to Vick, and Vick considers him one of the two greatest nemeses of his entire career, along with Julius Peppers, who he played all the time because they were in the same division in the NFC South when Vick was on the Falcons. To me, as a player, that was something that really stood out.After a game like that, in terms of how he handled it, he never was a great interview after a game like that. He never had a whole lot to say. But if he played poorly, which was rare, or let's say he had a play where he looked bad, like the time Tom Brady deked him in the open field, he was really good talking about that. He was always better talking about things he didn't do well than his own greatness. He was also good talking about his teammates. He was always really passionate about praising his teammates and especially about defending his teammates. That was the thing that used to really get him riled up, and I think it ended up probably leading a lot of members of the media to think he was not the greatest guy because he was such a vociferous defender of his teammates, that that's really all that mattered to him.The way he handled a lot of those interviews was really a window into who he was and the type of person he was and what mattered most to him. He's probably the most humble superstar I've ever been around. He has very little to no ego whatsoever, and I think that's part of the secret of his success too. He never saw himself as great a player as he was. He saw himself as a guy who had to work hard for everything he had, do everything the right way. The way he was raised, it was what was in his DNA.(During the Hall of Fame vote), I think there wasn't much you could say against him other than this was his first time up, and he also was in competition, I guess, with Ray Lewis, who many people think might have been the greatest middle linebacker ever or one of the top couple anyway. Other than that, there's no argument against Brian Urlacher because he checked all of the boxes as a Hall of Famer.dwiederer@chicagotribune.combmbiggs@chicagotribune.comTwitter @BradBiggsrcampbell@chicagotribune.comTwitter @Rich_Campbellckane@chicagotribune.comTwitter @ChiTribKane___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "363"}

The Texas company had fired a 3D-printed gun called the \"Liberator\" and said half a million people had downloaded the blueprints for 3D-printing guns.The federal government shut the project down, ordering founder Cody Wilson to remove the files from the internet.But Wilson struck back with a free-speech lawsuit in 2015, and earlier this year achieved victory via a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice.On Thursday, New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal sent a letter ordering Wilson not to put the blueprints online.\"The files you plan to publish offer individuals, including criminals, codes that they can use to create untraceable firearms -- and even to make assault weapons that are illegal in my state,\" Grewal wrote.Publishing the blueprints online would \"flood the illegal firearms market and pose a direct threat to the public safety of my state,\" Grewal wrote.Wilson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Grewal threatened that the Defense Distributed will face legal action if it goes ahead with plans to publish the blueprints.___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "364"}

Mozilla revealed two design systems of 12 icons each to show what it is talking about. ( Mozilla Blog )Mozilla Firefox is rebranding, not just with one new logo for the popular internet browser but with 24 possible icons for all of its components.The Mozilla Firefox browser has seen its fair share of improvements recently, including the introduction of the side-by-side feature rolled out last month, followed by rumors that the team behind the software is working on a browser that can be controlled with voice commands. The Mozilla Firefox rebranding, however, extends far beyond that.Mozilla Launches Firefox RebrandingIn an official blog post, Mozilla admits that the Firefox brand often brings to mind the web browser. However, there is now more to Firefox than surfing the web, so Mozilla believes that its branding should now evolve.Mozilla has grown the Firefox brand to include not just the regular web browser and the Firefox Quantum browser. It now also includes a variety of internet products such as easy screenshots, file sharing, the Firefox Focus privacy browser, and the Firefox Reality VR browser.On its blog post, Mozilla shared two design system approaches on the new Firefox branding. Mozilla clarified that it is not crowdsourcing for which icons it will use, with no voting, and nobody being forced to design logos for free. The company is simply reaching out to its users to listen to feedback.The two design systems are made up of a Firefox masterbrand icon, general purpose browser icons, singularly focused browser icons, and new apps and services icons. Mozilla is still working on aspects such as graphic patterns and typography, which will all come together to complete the Mozilla Firefox rebranding.The masterbrand icon is one of the finer points of discussion: should Mozilla focus on a shape resembling the face of a fox, or should it keep the iconic fox tail swirl?It is unclear when the Mozilla Firefox rebranding will officially launch, as the icons shown in the two design systems are not yet final. However, one thing is for sure: the Firefox brand is changing for the better.Google Vs MozillaMozilla recently found itself in controversy when program manager Chris Peterson called out Google for allegedly slowing down YouTube in all other browsers aside from its own Chrome.Visiting YouTube using other browsers is a slow experience, and will also result in annoying pop-up notifications to download Chrome. If users proceed with installing Chrome and accessing YouTube through it, they will find that YouTube is loading faster.Fortunately, there is a workaround for Firefox users. The slowdown by Google may be circumvented by downloading the YouTube Classic extension, which will force the video-sharing website to load properly.", "id": "366"}

{"content": "The Miami Dolphins are at it again today with practice number four and yesterday a Fox News reporter went on a Twitter tirade about one Ryan Tannehill.On Saturday it was announced that the plan for today\u2019s practice would be full pads but that wasn\u2019t the case afterall. Gase told the media the plan was to go full contact on Sunday but something changed. Perhaps a threat of bad weather?If the Dolphins have to move the practice inside it\u2019s possible that Gase would rather run with shells and uppers instead. Either way the Dolphins are on the field continuing the grind.A few early morning observations from camp goers has Albert Wilson taking a hand-off and Mike Gesicki making blocks. Interesting. There is a dynamic with Wilson that we have yet to see yet.Gesicki told the media that he has a long way to go especially with blocking but that while he does make some, he misses some and learns from them.As to the tirade. Well it has the Dolphins Twitter universe buzzing for certain. Former ESPN sports reporter Britt McHenry went on a tirade about Ryan Tannehill on Saturday. At one point she claimed that she knew \u201cfive women who would be a better quarterback than Tannehill.\u201d Then she named five including minority owner Serena Williams.McHenry suspended from ESPN after a viral video surfaced of her verbally berating a towing employee. It was laced with profanity. She would later be fired.She claims to be a Dolphins fan and apparently has had enough of Tannehill. Oddly enough she looks similar to his wife Lauren. Maybe she\u2019s jealous.

{"content": "July 31--Notre Dame hasn't reached double-figure wins in consecutive seasons since a three-year stretch from 1991 to '93. The Irish aim to return to that type of consistency -- and more -- as they open fall camp Friday.Victories against USC and LSU were part of a 10-win 2017. This season opens with the return of the Michigan series and concludes with four of the final five games away from Notre Dame Stadium.Here are five questions heading into camp.1. How will the quarterback situation play out?Brandon Wimbush had the edge over Ian Book at the end of spring practice. Wimbush began the spring working with the first unit and had the same role as camp wrapped up with the Blue-Gold game.Wimbush threw for 16 touchdowns and ran for 14 in his first year as the starter, but the redshirt junior needs to improve his accuracy after completing just 49.5 percent.Book threw for two touchdowns off the bench in the Citrus Bowl against LSU, including the game-winner to Miles Boykin.While Phil Jurkovec won't be expected to start out of the gate, it will be interesting to watch how the freshman develops. On early signing day in December, coach Brian Kelly said he wanted Jurkovec to \"challenge\" the incumbent quarterbacks.2. Who will emerge at running back?Josh Adams turned pro, and the school confirmed in January that Deon McIntosh and C.J. Holmes were no longer members of the team. That leaves Dexter Williams and Tony Jones Jr. as the most experienced backs.Williams averaged 9.2 yards per carry last season (360 yards on 39 carries), but according to multiple reports, he might miss some games for disciplinary reasons. Jones rushed for 232 yards on 44 carries.Avery Davis and Jafar Armstrong -- who redshirted last season at quarterback and receiver, respectively -- saw time at running back in the spring. The freshman class includes Jahmir Smith and C'Bo Flemister.3. What are the expectations for the offensive line?Notre Dame won the Joe Moore Award last season, presented to the top offensive line in the nation. But All-Americans Quenton Nelson and Mike McGlinchey were top-10 NFL draft picks, and coach Harry Hiestand is now with the Bears.New line coach Jeff Quinn will lean on center Sam Mustipher and left guard Alex Bars. Both are captains.Tommy Kraemer (right guard) and Robert Hainsey (right tackle) split time at right tackle last season. Liam Eichenberg rounds out the group at left tackle.4. How will the defense perform under new coordinator Clark Lea?Lea replaces Mike Elko, who went to Texas A&amp;M. Lea coached the linebackers last season, and he'll benefit from the return of Te'von Coney, who led the team with 116 tackles.Linebacker Drue Tranquill and defensive lineman Jerry Tillery also elected to return. The Irish have nine starters back from a unit that tied for 46th nationally in total defense.5. Which freshmen will make an impact?The secondary and wide receivers were among the priorities for the 2018 recruiting class. Defensive back Houston Griffith was the highest-rated signee (No. 70 nationally) in the 247Sports.com composite rankings. He participated in spring practice.Kevin Austin (No. 82 nationally) was one of four four-star receiver signees. Jurkovec (No. 83) and linebackers Shayne Simon (No. 90) and Jack Lamb (No. 99) were also top-100 recruits.lpope@post-trib.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "372"}

{"content": "July 29--SAN FRANCISCO -- With an 8-5 win over the Brewers at AT&amp;T Park Sunday, the Giants earned Bochy's 1,906th career victory as a Major League manager, pushing him past Casey Stengel into 11th place on baseball's all-time wins list.Bochy probably owes a solid to bench coach Hensley Meulens, who snagged him the win by taking over managerial duties while the Giants skipper traveled to Cooperstown to be present for the Hall of Fame induction of Trevor Hoffman, who he managed for 12 seasons with the San Diego Padres.Despite the historic win, it's hard to imagine that Bochy did too much celebrating Sunday. With just three wins since the All-Star break, the Giants playoff chance are circling the drain quickly. They trail three teams in the National League West standings, including the first place Los Angeles Dodgers by 6 1/2 games.To make matters worse, co-aceJohnny Cueto met with doctors Sunday to access whether he'll need Tommy John surgery after he pitched a season-low four innings Saturday night. Pablo Sandoval also left Sunday's game in the fifth, limping toward the dugout holding his right hamstring after he tripled and scored on a sacrifice.Bochy, who took a red-eye flight to Albany, N.Y. after Saturday's game to attend the Hall of Fame induction ceremony, is planning to rejoin the team in time for pregame warmups in San Diego Monday. He's expected to provide an update on Cueto's health prior to Monday's game against the Padres.As Bochy nudged his way past Stengel, the Giants did their best to steer management away from being sellers before Tuesday's non-waiver trade deadline.The Giants put together their most offensively-prolific game since the All-Star break, scoring eight runs off 13 hits, the type of effort they'll need to put forth consistently to push for a playoff spot down the stretch.Buster Posey put together the type of game that Giants fans grew accustomed to seeing from him during their World Series years earlier this decade, going 4 for 5 with three RBI and two runs scored. Posey got the Giants on the scoreboard in the third, bringing in three runs with a double to left-center field. He also singled in the fifth, scoring off Sandoval's triple, and collected one baggers in the sixth and eighth.The Giants also picked up runs off sacrifice flies from Evan Longoria and Steven Duggar in the third and fifth, and Gorkeys Hernandez's 12th home run in the fourth.With the offensive breakout, the Giants finally provided support for Andrew Suarez (4-6), who did enough on the hill to earn his first win since June 29. After receiving three or fewer runs of support in 12 of his first 17 starts, Suarez needed the help Sunday, surrendering four earned runs off eight hits and a walk in six innings of work.Suarez coughed up a two-run homer to Ryan Braun in the first, a long ball to Hernan Perez in the sixth and a run off a walk and a single in the fifth. Travis Shaw drove in the Brewers fifth run by homering off Sam Dyson in the seventh. Will Smith posted his fifth save by shutting the door in the ninth.___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "374"}

Caterpillar shares were up 0.5% to $143.35 as of 1:30 p.m. ET. The company also boosted its full-year outlook. De Maria noted that the company's overall backlog of $17.7 billion was flat quarter-over-quarter, perhaps signaling a deceleration of new building. Earnings per share for Caterpillar were $2.97, above consensus estimates of $2.73, and 83% above earnings per share year-over-year. Sales for the company's largest segment, construction equipment, were up 23%, including 43% in the Asia Pacific market, which includes China and 18% in North America. Groups sales were $14 billion, topping analysts' estimates of $11.3 billion and 9% higher than first quarter 2018. Caterpillar stock has taken some hits recently around concerns of constrained steel supply linked to tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump on foreign metal. The impact of the tariffs are expected to add $100 to $200 million in extra material costs this year, according to the company.

{"content": "Aug. 01--As Mayor Rahm Emanuel prepares to seek his third term at the city's helm, his budget team on Tuesday ruled out any major tax increases to close a relatively small projected budget shortfall in the coming year.The 2018 Annual Financial Analysis, a starting point for shaping next year's spending plan, pegged the 2019 operating budget shortfall at $97.9 million -- the lowest predicted gap since Emanuel took office in 2011, when the mayor he had to close a 2012 budget chasm of $636 million.Budget Director Samantha Fields said a property tax increase would not be needed to balance next year's books.\"We don't expect to have a tax increase that you've seen in the past, but we'll have a better idea of how we'll solve for the gap in the next few months,\" she said, before flatly ruling out a property tax increase. \"We may have small recommendations from the departments on revenues here or there, but I don't anticipate any large ones that will move heaven and earth.\"The relatively good news on the budget front is reminiscent of 2014, when Emanuel proposed a budget for the following year that included a few relatively minor increases in targeted taxes to raise $61 million. Months after winning reelection in early 2015, he pushed through a phased-in $543 million increase in property taxes to boost contributions to pension funds for city police officers and firefighters.If he emerges victorious from what is shaping up to be a large field of mayoral contestants in next year's election, he may again have to deliver bad news to city taxpayers. The financial analysis shows that the city in 2023 will need more than $2.1 billion to make its required contributions to the city's four worker pension funds, up from about $1.2 billion next year.The city projects that spending for day-to-day operating costs will increase next year to more than $3.8 billion, an increase of nearly $50 million over budgeted spending for this year. That's attributable to rising personnel costs and some expansions of city services, Fields said.The city also could find itself facing higher costs that were not included in the projected budget forecast. Those potentially include tens of millions of dollars for raises and back pay for police, firefighters and some other city workers whose unions are negotiating new contracts -- as well as any costs added to the expense of the running the Police Department as a result of a proposed federal consent decree aimed at restoring community trust in the long-troubled department.Emanuel in his first term tried to reduce the city's pension fund obligations, but the Illinois Supreme Court overruled the changes, saying they violated a state constitutional clause that state pension benefits, once granted, \"shall not be diminished or impaired.\" That left him little choice but to turn to tax increases.In addition to inheriting a huge pension funding hole when he took office in 2011, he also faced whopping budget shortfalls that were the result of the Great Recession, combined with former Mayor Richard M. Daley's reliance on one-time infusions of revenue -- such as the much-criticized long-term lease of city parking meters -- to balance budgets near the end of his 22-year tenure.To solve the budget and pension problems, as well as upgrading the city's aging water and sewer pipes, Emanuel pushed through the City Council property tax increases, a doubling of water and sewer fees, a new tax on water and sewer service, a garbage-hauling fee, higher 911 emergency fees on telephone bills, and other increases in less broad-based taxes, fees and fines. Property taxes also have increased significantly at Chicago Public Schools, which the mayor controls, largely to restore health to the teachers' pension fund.As a result, the overall taxes and fees being collected in 2018 by the city and CPS are nearly $2.2 billion more than when he took office, according to a Tribune tally. All told, the average family will pay $1,813 more this year in taxes and fees to the city and schools than it would have in 2011.The mayor also has ended certain risky borrowing practices that ended up driving up city costs; found new, less-expensive ways to borrow money, and cut health-care expenses.Even if there are no major tax increases in next year's budget, taxpayers will still end up paying more because of increases set in motion during previous years. A $63 million increase in the property tax, the last of four to boost police and fire pension funding, is in store for next year. And the water and sewer taxes, which are being used to increase contributions to the municipal workers' pension fund, also will increase again.hdardick@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "378"}
{"content": "The fox that attacked a woman in her backyard died after she strangled the creature to defend herself. The fox is confirmed to have been rabid at the time of the attack. ( Karen Arnold | Pixabay )A woman from New Jersey strangles and kills the fox that attacked her in her own yard. Hers is the first case of human attack by a rabid animal in the county this year.Rabid Fox StrangledOn July 18, 52-year-old Tammy Dubois of Pittsgrove, New Jersey, was attacked by a fox right in her own yard. Her ordeal began just shortly after she heard rustling sounds coming from the bushes while she was walking in her yard to go to her garden. At first, she thought it was a cat or dog, but then a fox ran out and bit her multiple times in the leg.According to Dubois, she tried to escape into her house but could not, as the fox was gnawing on her leg. Knowing she had to do something to escape, she grabbed the fox\u2019s neck with one hand and its snout with the other and began squeezing. Although the fox struggled for a while, it soon went limp from being choked. She then notified the neighbors of what had just happened, washed and bandaged her bleeding legs, and called her husband, who took her to the hospital to get treated.Dubois, who says she does not like to kill anything, told local news that she could not do anything else to get the fox away from her, as there were none of the usual gardening tools on her porch on the day of the attack.Animal Control eventually picked up the fox\u2019s body and later confirmed that it was indeed rabid.Rabies In The United StatesSalem County officials confirmed that the attack on Dubois was the first case of human attack in the county this year, as the other two cases involved rabid animals biting other animals. In addition, the fox that attacked Dubois is also the first fox to be confirmed rabid in the state of New Jersey this year.Apart from the fox, as of June 30, the New Jersey Department of Health has confirmed 72 rabies cases, which involve 49 rabid raccoons, 13 skunks, nine bats, nine cats, and one groundhog.Each year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention collects vital information on human and animal rabies cases from state health departments in order to create a summary report on rabies cases in the country. The latest report comes from 2015 data, wherein there were said to be 5,508 rabies cases in animals and three human rabies cases, the total number of which shows an 8.7 percent decrease in rabies cases compared to 2014, when there were over 6,000 reported rabies cases.Of the 2015 cases, wild animals accounted for 92.4 percent of the reports, with bats, raccoons, skunks, and foxes, respectively, were the most frequently reported rabid animals.", "id": "379"}

{"content": "Photo by Joe Robbins/Getty ImagesTennessee football is loaded at wide receiver for 2018. Here is a preview of the Volunteers for the season at that position.There was a time when was considered Wide Receiver U. That title, however, has faded in recent years due to a combination of the Clemson Tigers emerging and the Vols misusing their talent.Through five years of Butch Jones, the Vols began a process of limiting their elite playmakers in the passing game as much as possible. Jones had an obsession with running a five to six-man rotation, even if one receiver was the dominant mismatch.This year, with Tennessee football transitioning back to a pro-style offense under Tyson Helton and Jeremy Pruitt, Vols fans are hoping to see a few receivers with their talents maximized. That was the tradition that built guys like Robert Meachem, Donte Stallworth, Cedric Wilson, Peerless Price, Marcus Nash and Joey Kent.Even back to the Johnny Majors days, it created guys like Corey Fleming, Alvin Harper, Carl Pickens, and Willie Gault. Simply put, the Vols always maximized their top guys. And with Helton, it looks like they should get back to that.One unique thing about Helton\u2019s system, if you look at what he did with the Western Kentucky Hilltoppers, is that he likes to move around his go-to receivers. It\u2019s something that allows for slot guys to thrive. But wideouts can do so as well. It all depends on the personnel.In this post, we\u2019re going to take a look at that personnel as we preview this position. We\u2019ll give our projected starters at wideout, our projected slot receivers and our projected backups. As always with our previews, we\u2019ll then give our final take on the position heading into this year. So with the offense in question, here is our analysis on the state of Tennessee football at the wide receiver spot.", "id": "381"}
{"content": "Aug. 01--In an effort to end the contract impasse with first-round draft pick Roquan Smith, the Bears conceded they won't go after his guaranteed money if the linebacker gets suspended under the NFL's new rule legislating helmet contact, the Tribune has learned.The Bears made this concession even before the recent public disclosure of the major sticking point, according to a source with knowledge of the situation. They are one of eight NFL teams willing to include contract language protecting a first-rounder's guaranteed money if he's suspended for an illegal hit, a source said.But Smith remains away from training camp because his representatives at CAA Football have insisted the Bears go even further and include contract language protecting the player from discipline for behavior outside the realm of a football play. The Bears' reluctance to do so revolves around their fear of setting a precedent for future contracts and has nothing to do with concerns about Smith's character, the source said.The growing urgency as training camp opened two weeks ago compelled the Bears to approach Smith's agents to say they were willing to compromise their original position on the helmet issue as have other teams such as the Bills, Jets and Giants. The teams acquiesced because of the widespread ambiguity in interpreting the NFL's new rule legislating helmet contact and prohibiting \"using any part of a player's helmet to butt, spear, or ram an opponent.\"The Bears initially balked at excluding all such language -- as coach Matt Nagy's comments Saturday in Bourbonnais indicated -- but eventually compromised their position because it pertained to a football play. And such plays also were rare: NFL executive vice president of football operations Troy Vincent said only three plays out of 40,000 reviewed during the 2017 season would have resulted in an ejection under the newly adopted guidelines.A source familiar with negotiations said the Bears never intended to default Smith's guarantees over a football hit and the team introduced its 2017 experience with Danny Trevathan as evidence. Trevathan served a one-game suspension for an illegal hit on Packers receiver Davante Adams, but the Bears never tried to recoup money.CAA has declined to comment on Smith's contract negotiations. The Bears also declined to comment.Part of the Bears' motivation to find common ground with CAA was their strong desire to get Smith, the No. 8 selection, into camp and ready for Week 1.Now the urgency is increasing. Smith possesses the explosiveness and athleticism to start immediately. The frustration over Smith's continued absence expressed by defensive coordinator Vic Fangio on Tuesday has been felt throughout the organization. Smith is the only one of the 256 players drafted in April who has yet to sign his contract, making the Bears the target of widespread criticism.But only four teams in the league have written contracts going as far with protections as Smith seeks, a source said. The other 28 have avoided setting such contractual precedent, perhaps out of a fear of unintended consequences. It's not a common demand, according to one longtime agent who has negotiated NFL deals.The Bears open the exhibition season Thursday in Canton, Ohio, against the Ravens on national television. Smith won't attend, but the Bears hope this is the last game the linebacker will miss.dhaugh@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "382"}
{"content": "July 26--ARLINGTON, Texas -- For the second straight night, the A's found themselves in an early deficit, this time down four runs after six innings. For the second straight night, they came back to crush the Rangers' hearts, this time with a 6-5 victory to make it five in a row.Khris Davis was responsible for the anguish felt by fans at Globe Life Park for yet again. After homering Tuesday night in the 10th to put the A's (60-43) ahead to complete a wacky comeback, Davis again delivered a huge blow. Down to his last strike with two outs in the ninth against Jose Leclerc, Davis smashed a 2-2 fastball into the seats in right field to put the A's ahead by a run and silence the entire the park to the point where you could hear a pin drop.The A's slugger may never want to leave Texas. The heroic homer was his second of the night, as he also delivered in the seventh by crushing a 0-1 silder from Corey Gearrin well up the grass beyond the center field wall for a three-run homer that put the A's within a run and brought the fans at Globe Life Park a feeling of unease.It was Davis' sixth straight games with a home run against the Rangers, and his sixth home run in the past four games to put him at 26 for the season. The four straight games with a home run are a career-high for Davis.Edwin Jackson's quest for his 100th career win will have to wait another start. The right-hander failed to complete five innings for the first time in his six starts with the A's, allowing five runs on seven hits and two walks with four strikeouts over just 4 1/3 innings of work.The fastball velocity was still there, sitting anywhere from 92-96 mph throughout the start. But on a hot Texas night where the game time temperature at first pitch was 100 degrees, Jackson didn't seem to get much movement on his off-speed pitches as he normally does.Jackson's undoing came in the second. He threw 32 pitches in the inning, starting out by walking the first two batters he faced before allowing a three-run homer to Robinson Chirinos to put the Rangers (42-61) ahead by two runs at the time.___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "383"}
{"content": "July 28--NAPA -- But don't tell anybody with the Raiders that. If you do, they'll refute it. Heavily.\"The thing that you hear about that he can't run anymore,\" quarterback Derek Carr said, \"that's false.\"\"I can tell you, he's one of the fastest skill guys that we have still. He can run. You see that by his route running. If he can win on underneath routes, that means DBs are scared about what he can do over the top. He's still Jordy Nelson, that's for sure.\"Nelson may not be a No. 1 receiver anymore, but he can still sprinkle in plays like one every now and then. A couple impressive downfield routes and grabs proved just that during Day 1 of training camp on Friday.Nelson caught his fewest passes since 2012 last season (53) and tallied his fewest receiving yards (482) since 2009. He only found the end zone six times. You have to go all the way back to 2010 to find the last time he caught fewer than that many touchdown passes. Granted, Aaron Rodgers only logging seven games last season due to a collarbone injury played a significant role in Nelson's slide, but he's tasked with rebounding from a down year nonetheless.\"He's wired in,\" Raiders' head coach Jon Gruden said. \"You can see why he was a security blanket for Rodgers all those years. He can still run. He's proven to us he can still run. We can line him up anywhere we want and he can run any route we draw up. We're really encouraged by him.\"You'll mainly see Nelson on the outside, lined up across the field from Amari Cooper. Nelson seems to sit firmly in the Raiders' No. 2 receiver spot. Cooper is the clear No. 1, and Gruden hardly showered Martavis Bryant with praise Friday, saying the first-year Raider is still a work in progress.Not only do the Raiders hope they reap the benefits of Nelson's skillset, they believe he adds a much-needed veteran presence in a youthful receivers room. Cooper is 24, Bryant 26, Ryan Switzer 23 and Seth Roberts 27.\"He's a tremendous leader,\" Raiders' offensive coordinator Greg Olson said. \"He's a mentor to the younger players. I think they really appreciate that, including Amari. I think that's a good relationship there with those two. You see them together a lot and talking and that's been real positive ... just his professionalism that he brings to that room.\"As we've seen the first three days you've been out here, he's made some impressive catches and he's shown exceptional speed after the catch.\"Carr faced the task of meshing with Nelson after he formed one of the league's most dependable quarterback-wide receiver combos in Green Bay. Carr began that mission even before Nelson signed, picking him up from the airport when he landed in the Bay Area for his visit back in mid-March. Since then, the two have continued to hit it off. They may never reach the Rodgers-Nelson pinnacle, but the Raiders would gladly take anything close to that.\"He's just a guy that it's easy to throw to him because he's open,\" Carr said. \"There are some guys that are good at running some routes, a guy will be there that's strong at catching the ball or whatever. He just gets open. He's very route savvy. He's very smart.\"I can't say enough good things. I can't believe Green Bay let him go, but I'm glad he's here.\"___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "384"}

{"content": "The most profound inspirational quotes about fitness carry a weight capable of elevating a rough workout from demoralizing struggle to righteous, eye-opening victory of mind over body. Sometimes, you only need a single reminder that someone before you rose to incredible heights only after challenging the definition of \u201cimpossible\u201d through consistency, clearly defined goals and the will to see the finish line beyond one bad day. Remember, every healthy body is the product of individual positive decisions chained together into a greater whole. Which thoughts will you choose to feed the next time your usual drive to finish a run or set aside an hour for yoga goes AWOL?Memorize these inspirational quotes. Hear them in your head before you doze off to sleep. Set them to an adrenaline-pumping soundtrack and upload a montage to YouTube. However you internalize them, make each word a tiny plate of armor the next time anything or anyone suggests your fitness goals will never be within your reach. Whatever might be stopping you right now, bet that somebody has already overcome it.     Here are some inspirational quotes to help you on your fitness journey:\u201cI\u2019ve missed more than 9,000 shots in my career. I\u2019ve lost almost 300 games. Twenty-six times, I\u2019ve been trusted to take the game-winning shot and missed. I\u2019ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.\u201d \u2013 Michael JordanThe most successful professional basketball player the world has ever known didn\u2019t make his high school varsity team as a freshman. Unfortunately for every opponent he would face from that day forward, failing to make the cut at Emsley A. Laney High School only stoked Michael Jordan\u2019s fire.\u201cWhenever I was working out and got tired and ?gured I ought to stop, I\u2019d close my eyes and see that list in the locker room without my name on it,\u201d he later explained. \u201cThat usually got me going again.\u201d     For the rest of his career, that same competitive blaze became Jordan\u2019s hallmark, a reason to fear just exactly how driven he would be if anyone ever got the best of him.\u201cEveryone has a plan \u2018till they get punched in the mouth.\u201d \u2013 Mike TysonAs inspirational quotes about fitness go, this one doesn\u2019t mince words: what do you do when someone or something defeats your best strategy? Whatever you do, things can and will go awry. In the ring, Mike Tyson always had the same choice as any fighter after catching one on the chin: give up or adapt.     Remember, when Plan A fails, you still have 25 letters left in the alphabet. Try the next best thing. Take what circumstance gives you, and you may find it pans out surprisingly better than what you originally had in mind.\u201cDon\u2019t count the days. Make the days count.\u201d \u2013 Muhammad AliAlways trust a fighter accustomed to scraping for every hard-fought win to one day produce at least a few insightful, inspirational quotes. Few were ever quite as introspective as the late, great Muhammad Ali.Here\u2019s a doozy of a reality check: anxiety stems from focusing too far ahead of the present. Meanwhile, depression often takes root because we spend too much time looking backwards. Stop keeping score of how many days you supposedly have left to meet a fitness goal or how many you spent without living up to your own expectations. Instead, acknowledge today as all the guaranteed time you have and make the most of every moment.\u201cCreate healthy habits, not restrictions.\u201d \u2013 UnknownYou could file this under \u201cinspirational quotes about about fitness\u201d or simple common sense. Above all else, you may need to change the way you look at yourself. What receives more of your valuable energy, thinking about everything you cannot do or exploring positive actions you know will benefit your well-being? Celebrate the good things your choices bring into your life, and savor them as your rewards for constantly working toward your goals. As another old saying goes, \u201cWhen you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change.\u201d\u201dNo matter how many mistakes you make or how slow you progress, you are still way ahead of everyone who isn\u2019t trying.\u201d \u2013 Tony RobbinsTo his millions of followers, Tony Robbins could practically pen a personal religious text using only his own advice. This one places relative success into a particularly stark light for anyone who has ever spent a month or more working out and still hated what stared back from the mirror.OK, so your thighs may not crush walnuts yet. Your biceps wouldn\u2019t lock up this year\u2019s Mr. Universe title. Compare that to how far you are ahead of someone who refuses to take a single step toward a goal such as yours. Getting off the couch for just one set of push-ups still lands you ahead of anyone remains seated.\u201dIf you are working on something that you really care about, you don\u2019t have to be pushed. The vision pulls you.\u201d \u2013 Steve JobsSurprise! Inspirational quotes about about fitness don\u2019t always come from athletes or celebrated personal trainers.In this case, Apple founder Steve Jobs would remind you to never forget why you started chasing something. Yes, you want to run a marathon, but why? What is it about running such an insane race that compelled you to start training? Zero in on that triumphant dream and everything associated with it that moves you. Focus on everything you cannot stop wanting. Do that, and you will never lose sight of what pulled you to your feet in the first place. Just get to the very heart of your desire.\u201cThe price of success is hard work, dedication to the job at hand, and the determination that whether we win or lose, we have applied the best of ourselves to the task at hand.\u201d \u2013 Vince LombardiThe NFL has never known a more hard-nosed, bluntly spoken coach than the legendary Vince Lombardi. Truly, inspirational quotes such as this one encapsulated the one thing he asked of every player he ever led onto the gridiron: everything.Lombardi was realistic. He knew that every man had his limit. That\u2019s why he demanded only that every player who suited up under his watch left nothing in the tank at the end of the day. If his team ended up on the short side of the score, so be it, as long as they left no doubt they had not an iota of energy or effort left. On those days, someone else\u2019s \u201cbest\u201d was simply better. That was out of anyone else\u2019s hands.Ask yourself, \u201cCould I have done anything else today?\u201d No? Then cut yourself some slack.For all the inspirational quotes about fitness listed here, there are another hundred or so worthy pearls of wisdom out there capable of lighting a profound fire beneath anyone. From Wayne Gretzky to Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson, the world\u2019s most decorated names in fitness have often overcome untold adversities before passing along their lessons.

{"content": "It looks like Fox may be going back to the 24 well once more.In May, chairman and CEO of FoxTV Group Dana Walden announced that 24 showrunner Howard Gordon, along with co-creators Joel Surnow and Bob Cochran, was working on a new project in the 24 universe.Now, Deadline reveals that after eight seasons, a revival series, and a reboot, the show is going where it hasn\u2019t gone before: into the past with a prequel series.The series would trace the origin story of 24 hero Jack Bauer. It would take place before the start of the original series in 2001.Bauer was played by Kiefer Sutherland for all eight seasons of the series and in the revival 24: Live Another Day.However, Sutherland has been candid about the physical demands of the role. He has indicated that he likely won\u2019t be returning to the terrorist-torturing, always-running character anytime soon.A prequel could bring back the fan-favorite character without the need for Sutherland to reprise the role.Want your voice heard? Join the Show Snob team!This is one of two 24 reboots currently in development at Fox and Imagine TV.Brian Grazer from Imagine, Fox and Gordon have been considering new ideas for the real-time action drama since its last reboot, 24: Legacy, fizzled in 2017. Gordon and Jeremy Doner are also working on a legal thriller in the 24 universe.It\u2019s understandable that Fox and 24\u2018s producers would want to keep the franchise alive. The series was a ratings\u2019 powerhouse and won Emmys for Outstanding Drama Series and Outstanding Actor for Sutherland about halfway through its eight-season run.Yet, the most recent attempt at a reboot without Sutherland didn\u2019t do well with audiences or critics and was canceled after a single season.Since the producers can\u2019t have Sutherland back, it makes sense that they would want to find a way to bring back his character in some capacity. Gordon, Surnow, and Cochran have written for Jack Bauer for years and, therefore, could likely write a compelling backstory for him.The key to the prequel, then, would likely be casting. Who could successfully replace Sutherland by bringing the same amount of intensity and conviction to the role of Jack Bauer?

{"content": "Aug. 02--In a matter of hours Wednesday, a state lawmaker went from a rising star in the Republican Party to the subject of news releases calling for his resignation. Rep. Nick Sauer, R-Lake Barrington, stepped down after a news outlet published allegations he engaged in \"revenge porn.\"The lightning-quick turnaround is something to behold in Springfield. Allegations of behavior that used to be excused, tolerated and buried are now addressed seriously, swiftly and publicly.We credit one thing: the courage of women willing to speak out.According to a story first reported by Politico, an ex-girlfriend of Sauer's filed a complaint with the Chicago Police Department and the state's legislative inspector general, accusing Sauer of creating a fake social media account where he posted nude photos of her. She said she sent the pictures to him during their two-year courtship, which ended earlier this summer, and did not know he had been posting them publicly.Within hours of the story's publication, House Republican Leader Jim Durkin announced that Sauer, a freshman state rep, would step down by the end of the day. In his resignation letter, Sauer said allegations from a \"former girlfriend\" would be a \"distraction\" from his ability to serve fully. Republicans still have time to replace him on the fall ballot.Sauer's departure follows the resignation of Tim Mapes, House Speaker Michael Madigan's chief of staff, in June. A colleague, Sherri Garrett, accused Mapes of lewd remarks and harassing conduct. Before that, it was Denise Rotheimer who exposed flirty social media exchanges with Sen. Ira Silverstein, D-Chicago. A few months later, Alaina Hampton, a Democrat Party campaign staffer, alleged she was subjected to unwanted advances by one of Madigan's aides, who was subsequently fired.Sauer's former girlfriend, Kate Kelly, who spoke to Politico about her case, said she recently discovered an Instagram account that contained nude pictures of her.Sen. Melinda Bush, D-Grayslake, said Sauer may have violated a 2014 Illinois law that criminalized the act of sharing intimate images without the consent of the subject, a practice known generally as \"revenge porn.\" Posting such material can devastate the victim, leading to potential job losses and even stalking, supporters of the law testified. Illinois' law is one of the strictest in the nation with penalties of up to three years in prison.Bush also called for Sauer to be removed from the joint task force on sexual harassment, which she chairs. But by end of day, he was gone.Allegations involving elected officials and staff in Springfield used to be directed to an ethics office that existed mostly on paper. Now it is staffed with an inspector general who means business. Springfield isn't known for making meaningful progress in many areas.

I picked up this\u00a0Levi\u2019s denim skirt\u00a0a year ago and it\u2019s been my go to for Summer outfits always. It\u2019s the perfect shade of light blue and hangs just right. I went for a afternoon bunch look by pairing this outfit with stilettos sandals and my new bougie micro bag from Gucci. I love these Sobeyo heels. They look great with a casual outfit or dressed up with a dress. They are also super comfortable to walk in. To keep the beige theme going, I matched my shoes with my new Gucci\u00a0Dionysus Super Mini Bag.I was in dire need of a Summer bag. Sadly my options for Summer included black bags. I didn\u2019t want to spend a lot after recently purchasing my Chanel boy. I felt a micro bag would be the perfect way for me to get away with a non-black trendy bag.LOOKS:I had always loved the Gucci print and felt I was making a better choice getting the smaller size than the larger sizes available. I love how much is going on with this bag. Between the print, suede, silver buckle and hardware I couldn\u2019t resit! I chose the black suede or the taupe because I wanted to get use out of this bag in the Fall/Winter as well.PRACTICALITY:This of course is not the most practical bag, but who said it was supposed to be. I think this bag is meant to be fun. For an event or going out for drinks at night when you only need to carry a cardholder and your phone. I personally don\u2019t carry much ever, I never got why women carry so much. On a regular basis, I carry no more than a phone, my wallet, car keys and a lipstick or perfume. These are my bare essentials I can\u2019t leave the house without. So to me, this bag is practical. I also love how many ways you can wear this bag. You can watch my full in depth review of this bag\u00a0HERE\u00a0and see the many ways to wear this bag.VALUE:This bag is at a good price point if you\u2019re looking to spend under $1k on a designer bag. When it comes to understanding if designer bags are worth it, you need to calculate your cost per wear. If you are looking to use this bag everyday, you\u2019ll have a lower cost per wear. If you don\u2019t plan to use a designer bag much, it might not be worth the investment. There are bags I invest in long-term because I know they\u2019ll be in my collection forever. I don\u2019t buy bags impulsively. Every bag I\u2019ve purchased, I\u2019ve sat on for a year or two. Doing this helps me know if I\u2019ll get tired of it.OVERALL THOUGHTS:I think this is a great bag if you\u2019re looking to add a little luxury into your life, but you don\u2019t want to commit to a larger size designer bag. I wanted to get a bag that was fun and I think I achieved that. I am super happy about my purchase and can\u2019t wait to share with you guys how I style and wear it. I will be going to Cabo San Lucus, Mexico in a week and will definitely have this on my hip!", "id": "389"}
{"content": "Aug. 01--\"The Spy Who Dumped Me\" gets by, barely, thanks mainly to Kate McKinnon. Her crazily fluid and unpredictable comic timing, and her willingness to go big -- well past Madeline Kahn-big and very near Eddie Cantor-big -- has saved several movies. She salvaged the \"Ghostbusters\" reboot, rescued parts of \"Rough Night,\" and wrung what she could out of the damp rag \"Office Christmas Party.\" Working with a game Mila Kunis, McKinnon takes care of this one, too, whether with some screwy verbal aside (her character talks about auditioning for a Geico ad as a Ukrainian farm girl, and being told she was \"too authentic\") or pulling a pop-eyed, slaw-jacked, weirdly delighted reaction to whatever the plot is up to.Usually the plot's up to people getting impaled, or kicked in the face, or tortured by sinister enemy gymnasts. Co-writer/director Susanna Fogel's action comedy about best friends caught up in international espionage is stupidly, relentlessly violent. This makes it hard for the audience to relax and enjoy. Yet McKinnon's apparent improvisations and inventions, create a second, better movie in the margins.Seriously: Why have action comedies turned into a series of grisly \"kills\" (detestable plural noun) barely making room for the \"comedy\" part? The influences go back a generation or two, when the first \"Beverly Hills Cop\" or \"48 Hrs.\" came out. Audiences went crazy for the Eddie Murphy banter within those action thriller confines. Also those films were really sharp; the mixtures worked, though it took \"Beverly Hills Cop\" exactly one sequel to screw it up.More recently, and more pertinent to the blueprints used for \"The Spy Who Dumped Me,\" the Melissa McCarthy vehicle \"Spy\" clicked despite an overreliance on mayhem. (Killing's easier than wit, and a more reliable ingredient for international box office.) In the McCarthy movie, we got a hugely funny accidental-shooting sight gag in the first minute, the setup bouncing off the tropes and conventions of Bond/Bourne/\"Mission: Impossible.\" It takes \"The Spy Who Dumped Me\" far longer to get going, toggling as it does between intrusive flashbacks and present-day globe-trotting.Fogel's script, co-written by David Iserson, starts with Audrey (Kunis), an LA clerk at a Trader Joe's-type store, smarting over a breakup text she's received from razor-sideburns boyfriend Drew (Justin Theroux). Allegedly the host of an NPR podcast combining \"jazz and economics,\" in reality he's a CIA agent in possession of a flash drive full of valuable and dangerous information. Others want it, and when Drew shows up at Audrey's apartment, with assassins on his tail, \"The Spy Who Dumped Me\" ropes Audrey and her best pal, Morgan, the aspiring actress played by McKinnon, into the chase to Vienna, Paris, Prague and environs.You could do worse than that premise, and McKinnon and Kunis bring a can-do spirit to the material. Sam Heughan's charming British agent presents a love interest for Audrey, and a handy bookend for Theroux's character. Ace character man Fred Melamed pops in as a smooth, cultured friend of Audrey's father (Paul Reiser), enticed by Morgan, though he's barking up the wrong tree. (Come-on: \"Are you into Balzac?\" Reply: \"Less and less, with every experience.\") But promising bits, such as McKinnon infiltrating a Cirque du Soleil-style show and trying to fake her way through it, go nowhere. And somewhere around the 40th act of brutality, played straight, I just wanted McKinnon to chase a better movie. See this one for what's going on in the margins.Michael Phillips is a Tribune critic.mjphillips@chicagotribune.com\"The Spy Who Dumped Me\" -- 2.5 starsMPAA rating: R (for violence, language throughout, some crude sexual material and graphic nudity)Running time: 1:57Opens: Thursday evening___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "390"}
{"content": "July 30--Having witnessed his work at Stanford and with the 49ers, we here in the Bay Area know Jim Harbaugh to be the real deal as a football coach. We also know he's an odd duck.Speaking of fowl, Harbaugh is breaking in a new quarterback at Michigan -- Shea Patterson, a transfer from Ole Miss. On Monday Matt Hayes of Bleacher Report published a fine story spotlighting Patterson's experience at Ole Miss, his acclimation to Michigan and something Hayes calls the Harbaugh effect.The Harbaugh effect?\"Former Michigan (and current UCLA) quarterback Wilton Speight tells a story to sum it up nicely,\" Hayes wrote. \"Early in his Michigan tenure, Harbaugh pulled Speight aside and told him not to eat chicken, a protein that is considered fairly safe by nutritionists. When Speight asked why, Harbaugh said, \"because it's a nervous bird.\"Harbaugh went on to advise Speight that some kind of illness beset humans when they gravitated to white meat from of red meat.\"And he believes it,\" Speight told Hayes. \"One hundred percent.\"\"He's as real as it gets,\" Patterson told Hayes. \"He's just how you'd think he'd be. He's definitely a character, a little bizarre. You'll be sitting there talking to him and you're thinking, 'What the hell is this guy talking about?'\"Tell us about it. In fact, this seems like an apt time for a list of 10 \"What the hell is this guy talking about?\" Harbaugh moments.1. \"I don't take vacations. I don't get sick. I don't observe major holidays. I'm a jack hammer.\"2. \"I was and still am happier than a pig in slop.\"3. \"People talk about cold weather and it'd be tough to catch balls. But the greatest catcher of all time, Michael Crabtree, catches everything. It's unbelievable. In the northern snowlands, down to the tropics' sunny scenes, he's catching the football. Where they throw a football, he'll be catching it.\"4. \"You're kind of numb after 50 shots to the head.\"5. \"I drank a lot of milk. A lot of milk. Whole milk, though. Not the candy-ass two percent or skim milk.\"6. \"Apologies always seem to me like excuses.\"7. \"Suggestion to my Rocky Top colleague, rather than lunch in Florida you might spend your time and focus attending to your present team.\"8. \"I'm not leaving Michigan. I'm not even considering it. A lot of this talk is coming from our enemies, from coaches, you know the names.

(Photo by Tim Warner/Getty Images)With less than one month left until the start of the 2018 regular season for Texas football, how could this season shake out?Texas football has a long and grueling schedule to deal with for playing in the Big 12 in 2018. It\u2019s arguable that the road schedule is tougher than at home this fall. And, the 2018 slate features 11 Power Five opponents in the regular season which is more than any other programs in the conference.This 2018 slate features Big 12 road games against the Oklahoma State Cowboys, Texas Tech Red Raiders, Kansas Jayhawks, and Kansas State Wildcats. The home conference slate comes against the TCU Horned Frogs, West Virginia Mountaineers, Baylor Bears, and Iowa State Cyclones.Two games do come at a neutral site this year against the Maryland Terrapins (to open the season) and the Oklahoma Sooners. The matchup with the Terps is pretty much a road game for Texas since it comes at the home of the Washington Redskins at Fedex Field in Landover, MD. The Red River Shootout is played at its usual location at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas, TX.The other two games this season come against the USC Trojans and Tulsa Golden Hurricane. Both come at Darrell K. Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium on the Forty Acres. The good news here for the Horns is that eight of the 12 regular season games either come at home or at a neutral site. Although, that doesn\u2019t take away from how tough it will be to face Oklahoma State, Kansas State, and Texas Tech on the road.Want your voice heard?

The social media platform had the worst one-day loss in U.S. stock market history on Thursday, July 26, when it lost $120 billion in market capitalization. At its lowered price, is it a good time to add the stock to a retirement portfolio? \"I'm still quite bullish on Facebook,\" Marlon Nichols, managing partner at venture capital firm Cross Culture Ventures, told TheStreet on Friday. \"It has seen several competitors enter the space and has maintained its position as the leader through acquisition, innovation and improving on functionality that some of those competitors introduced to the market. I don't see that changing for some time to come.\" Investors dumped Facebook stock Thursday after the company reported its second-quarter earnings on Wednesday after the bell. It missed revenue estimates, causing a selloff in aftermarket trading that continued the next day. At its lower price, Facebook stock is more attractive and could be a good addition to a retirement portfolio for those who don't mind a little risk. Ken Nuttall, director of financial planning for BlackDiamond Wealth Management, said he has younger clients contacting him since Facebook's price plummeted. \"They tend to be users of Facebook and are buying what they know or use,\" Nuttall said. \"Facebook is becoming more of a necessary tool as one-third of the world uses one of its products each month.\" Before jumping all-in with Facebook, though, Values Quest wealth adviser Alex Koury suggested people ask themselves five questions: 1.

{"content": "July 30--Last season provided a number of NFL landmarks that remind us why the game is so popular. New Orleans quarterback Drew Brees recorded the highest completion percentage for a single season. Buffalo's Stephen Hauschka connected on his 13th consecutive field goal of 50 yards or more, which had never been done before. At 40, Tom Brady became the oldest man ever named Most Valuable Player.Another record, however, was a reminder of the serious challenges to the popularity and long-term viability of professional football. In the 2017 season, 291 concussions were diagnosed -- affecting one out of every 11 players. In other words, of the 22 players you see trot out onto the field for the first play from scrimmage, you can expect that two of them won't finish the season without an acute traumatic injury to the brain.During the offseason, the NFL acted to reduce this alarming risk. Its new rule is simple and stark. Any player who \"lowers his head to initiate and make contact with his helmet against an opponent\" will be flagged for unnecessary roughness at a cost of 15 yards. For severe violations, players will be ejected.This is stricter than college football's targeting rule, which bans any hit to a defenseless player's head or neck and typically involves a receiver leveled by a defensive back. And the NFL ban applies to offensive as well as defensive players, including linemen.This rule is at issue in the contract negotiations between the Bears and their first-round draft pick, linebacker Roquan Smith. He has held out demanding a provision that if he is suspended for violating the rule, the team won't take back some of his guaranteed pay. He fears he will have trouble adapting his aggressive style to fit the new rule. The Bears have refused, and with good reason: It makes no sense to protect a player from the consequences of making illegal hits.A lot of grumbling has been heard from players about how the league is changing the game, forcing them to unlearn techniques that have long been standard. What they and Smith should appreciate is that the reform is for their health and safety. Of the concussions last season, the NFL determined, 57 came on plays that would have drawn a flag under the new rule.The change addresses just one part of a broader malady: the epidemic of chronic traumatic encephalopathy among former professional players. Dr. Ann McKee, a neuropathologist at Boston University's medical school, reported last year that she had examined the brains of 111 deceased NFL veterans -- 110 of them had CTE. Preventing concussions would be helpful, though the ordinary blows to the head that football entails are believed to be enough to cause this debilitating and incurable disease.The human consequences of CTE -- memory loss, depression, dementia and more -- are enormous. Even the NFL's financial health is at risk. It entered a settlement that obligates it to compensate hundreds of former players, with the total amount expected to surpass $1 billion. The league is under intense pressure to find ways to minimize the risk to its athletes.The implementation of this rule may be messy. Expect the preseason to feature a lot of confusion and a lot of yellow laundry on the turf. Expect a lot of griping from people accusing the NFL of becoming a refuge for pantywaists.But the game has undergone many changes to make it safer, and the need for this one is hard to deny. Barring a retreat by the NFL, players will have to stop using their helmets as weapons. Atlanta Falcons CEO Rich McKay, head of the competition committee, emphasized the need \"to teach it out of the game\" and \"get it out of the game.\"That achievement will protect not only those being blocked and tackled but those who do the blocking and tackling -- Roquan Smith included. Like others, he will need to adapt. Facing the possibility of swift, stern penalties, we're confident he'll learn to operate under the new rule.Every important reform creates a certain amount of disruption and discontent. In the end, though, professional football will be safer than before. It needs to be.RELATED NEWSJoin the discussion on Twitter @Trib_Ed_Board and on Facebook.Submit a letter to the editor here or email letters@chicagotribune.com.___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "394"}
{"content": "Aug. 01--Just when you thought it was safe to go back to salad, federal food safety inspectors are warning of another potential cyclospora contamination, this time affecting salads and wraps sold by Trader Joe's, Walgreens and Kroger.The new recall, which the Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service issued this week, does not affect the Kroger-owned Mariano's grocery chain, company spokesman Jim Hyland said Wednesday.The products, which were distributed by Caito Foods of Indianapolis, all have \"sell by\" dates ranging from July 18 to July 23.The warning was issued out of an \"abundance of caution,\" federal inspectors said in a news release, urging consumers not to consume the affected products, which should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.Caito Foods received notification from its lettuce supplier, Fresh Express, that the chopped romaine used to make some of their salads and wraps was being recalled. Products include roast beef wraps, chicken Caesar wraps, chef salads and other packaged offerings. Pre-cut melon from Caito was linked to a salmonella outbreak this past spring.In a recorded message, Salinas, Calif.-based Fresh Express said the recall does not affect its retail salad products.\"Fresh Express recalled, as a precaution only, a limited of already-expired food service products,\" the company said. \"No Fresh Express products offered for sale at retail grocery stores are recalled.\"The incubation period for the cyclospora parasite is about a week, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Symptoms include watery diarrhea, loss of appetite, nausea and fatigue.The summer has been rife with recalls and reported cyclospora infections.Last month, Chicago-based McDonald's temporarily stopped selling salads at 3,000 restaurants in 14 states, mostly in the Midwest, after a cyclospora outbreak sickened dozens of customers.A large outbreak of cyclospora infections were also linked to an Independence Day celebration July 3 at the Evanston Golf Club in Skokie.Del Monte Fresh Produce in June issued a voluntary recall of vegetable trays sold in six Midwest states including Illinois, due to potential cyclospora contamination.A complete list of the Caito Foods salad products affected by the current recall are listed here.rchannick@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "395"}
{"content": "LAKEPORT (Lake County) - When they yelled \u201cfire\u201d in the theater, it was for real. Moviegoers at the Lakeport Cinema 5, near the shores of Clear Lake, were watching the sequel to the romantic comedy \u201cMamma Mia!\u201d this week when fire officials rushed into the playhouse and announced that the town of just over 5,000 residents was being evacuated because of the River Fire.  \u201cWe were almost through the movie and they flipped on the lights,\u201d said resident Annette Hopkins, who on Monday had been out of her house for more than 24 hours, staying with friends. \u201cWe didn\u2019t even get to see the Cher part.\u201d As dozens of wildfires ripped across the state this week, the lives of tens of thousands of Californians have been upended in big and small ways. The latest disruption was to the several communities along the western shore of Clear Lake, where the River Fire was one of two major blazes burning in the hills high above water\u2019s edge. The fires, dubbed the Mendocino Complex, were the most recent to threaten Lake County, a rural region 100 miles north of San Francisco. Over the past four years, the county has been ravaged by wildfires, the most destructive of them the 2015 Valley Fire that wiped out nearly 1,500 homes and left four dead. \u201cI\u2019ve been saying that Lakeport is going to be next,\u201d Hopkins said. \u201cWe\u2019re the only place here that hasn\u2019t burned.\u201d The evacuation of town residents Charity and Andrew Hansen was a bit less hasty, if not anticlimactic. The couple had driven an hour to Santa Rosa on Saturday, the day before their city was declared off-limits, to escape the smoke. Before they could get back in, fire officials had shut them out.  \u201cOur neighbors called to tell us that we\u2019d been evacuated,\u201d said Charity, 40. Fortunately, their friends broke into the Hansens\u2019 home behind the courthouse before their own departures and grabbed the couple\u2019s two rottweilers, Panzer and Puppyloo. After reuniting with their dogs, the Hansens set up a tent that they happened to have in the trunk of their car at an evacuation center at Kelseyville High School. Late Monday, they had to uproot again after fire officials ordered an evacuation of Kelseyville and its approximately 3,000 residents. They were directed to evacuation centers in the nearby towns of Lower Lake and Middletown. Fire officials said Kelseyville, 6 miles south of here, was not in immediate danger, but winds were erratic and things could change. But in Lakeport, the thought of evacuating was just too much for some. Kenny Ridgeway, 48, runs a nutritional supplement business on the edge of Lakeport and wasn\u2019t about to risk losing it. He lined up garden hoses and buckets of water behind his warehouses to douse any spot fires that might spark up from the larger inferno that billowed in the distance. \u201cIf our inventory burns, it would take us six months to a year to replace it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not taking any chances.\u201d  Kurtis Alexander is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

{"content": "Aug. 04--The Bears returned to training camp Saturday morning at Olivet Nazarene University while the Hall of Fame celebration for Brian Urlacher crescendoed 400 miles away in Canton, Ohio.Two days removed from the exhibition opener, coach Matt Nagy detected a lull in his team, noting that 27 players who were held out of the game effectively had three days without football.\"This isn't an offense where you can skip days,\" Nagy said. \"You've got to stay in it, stay on your details. Otherwise you come out and have a sloppy practice, and I thought today was a little sloppy.\"Apparently, having a DJ mix hip-hop music throughout practice wasn't enough for players to summon sharp play. Although it might have been even sloppier if the mix had its usual share of Sugar Ray and Lenny Kravitz. For what it's worth, the DJ was a welcome change and significant upgrade.Here are five observations from practice. Keep in mind these are just snapshots of players' work to improve. They're trying new techniques and testing themselves in competitive situations, all in the pursuit of development.1. Mitch Trubisky was out of rhythm at times and inconsistent with his ball placement.This registers under Nagy's description of practice. Early on, Trubisky checked down to the flat but threw it at the feet of Jordan Howard, who had to go to the ground to catch it. Several dropbacks would have been sacks if contacting the quarterback were permitted. The ball didn't always come out on time. Trubisky was not available to reporters, but Nagy implied a general lack of sharpness due to the layoff.Trubisky overthrew Tarik Cohen deep down the left sideline during seven-on-seven drills. He stayed after practice to work on his deep throws. The important fundamental on the deep ball is a balanced base, Nagy has said. That enables a proper shoulder swing and follow-through.Trubisky was intercepted twice, although neither pick seemed to result from an ill-advised or poorly executed throw. Both passes hit tight end Daniel Brown in the hands. One drop was intercepted by Danny Trevathan. On the other, safety Eddie Jackson got his hand in the catch point, ripped the ball out, and John Timu caught the floating ball.2. Eddie Jackson continues to flash around the line of scrimmage.The second-year safety is equipped with instincts and range to be a major contributor to the pass defense, as evidenced by his breakup that resulted in an interception. But he also is flashing more in the box this summer, a relatively new layer to his game.In team drills Saturday, he would've sacked Trubisky on a bootleg attempt if he were allowed to tackle the quarterback. Last week during live tackling drills, he was aggressive fitting against the run.\"I'm more comfortable -- aware of the playbook, formations and different adjustments,\" Jackson said. \"I just want to be a player that can work on both, with the ball in the air and also when it's on the ground.\"His increased comfort and broader knowledge base enables him to read things better, he said. \"Timing up snaps, timing up blitzes. Run fits -- when the guard pulls, different fits against that. It's coming more naturally now.\"Jackson is most valuable in pass defense because his skills are relatively rare compared with those of a box safety. But the more he can do near the line of scrimmage, the more the Bears could vary his positioning and increase the unpredictability of his responsibilities.3. Leonard Floyd showed up in team drills with a sack.Floyd has had a quiet camp. He has been on the field consistently -- a significant check mark -- but there hasn't been a surplus of explosive plays to make him stand out. Of course, Floyd missed almost all of spring practices recovering from right knee surgery (PCL, MCL). Even though he insisted July 27 that he's fully healthy, it was helpful Tuesday to hear defensive coordinator Vic Fangio's perspective when he said, \"Leonard is fighting through his recuperation.\"With that as the subtext, Floyd's game performances merit close attention during the preseason. The Bears can't afford to have him at less than full strength. Not only are they not deep enough at outside linebacker, but they need players of his pedigree to perform up to those standards.So it was encouraging for the Bears that Floyd used an outside speed rush to get around the right side of the offensive line and disrupt Trubisky in team drills. On a rep before that, Floyd tried to swim inside right tackle Bobby Massie and did so with a noticeable burst, but Massie rode Floyd into right guard Kyle Long while Trubisky got the ball out.For what it's worth, Floyd seems to be moving OK in coverage too. There's a month until the season, so let's see if the explosive plays start to mount.4. Slot receiver Allen Robinson made a catch on an out-breaking route, but not before he ran into another receiver downfield.The intermediate-level throw from Trubisky and catch by Robinson were positives. But Robinson ran into the back of a teammate's legs, and it disrupted both. Here's guessing the route combination wasn't drawn up that way.5. Benny Cunningham's patience produced a long run.The veteran running back set up pulling center Eric Kush's block by slowing his outside run and letting Kush get out in front of him. Cunningham then hit the hole with some burst and got to the second level.His 30-yard run around the left edge in Thursday's game against the Ravens was a bit different. He captured the edge partly because receiver Benny Fowler won his block from a tight split. Also, the safety vacated the area downfield because of end-around play-action to Josh Bellamy.Cunningham's value as a running back is important to the offense's personnel puzzle because it will allow Nagy to deploy Cohen as a receiver. When Jordan Howard needs a break, the Bears won't necessarily hand the ball to Cohen. They can mix it up by bringing Cunningham into the backfield and letting Cohen continue doing his thing as a pass-catcher.Participation report: Cornerback Cre'Von LeBlanc (left groin), safety Deon Bush (left hamstring), center Hroniss Grasu (left calf) and linebacker Aaron Lynch (hamstring) sat out. Center James Daniels (shoulder) and linebacker Joel Iyiegbuniwe (shoulder) were limited.Nagy said there's nothing new to report regarding rookie holdout Roquan Smith. The Bears have only two full-speed practices before their next exhibition game Thursday against the Bengals.rcampbell@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "397"}
{"content": "The prolific Rogue One writer was queried about a number of subjects for Jedi News in recent interview.Gary Whitta is a busy man. He is known to most of us as a co-writer on the movie Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. His contributions to the Star Wars cannon run further however; he has written episodes of the animated series Star Wars: Rebels, has contributed to the anthology novel Star Wars: From a Certain Point of View, and most recently turned his talents to the Marvel Comics adaptation of Star Wars: The Last Jedi.He was recently interviewed by Mark Alders of jedinews.co.uk \u2013 and held forth on many subjects of interest to us fans. As we all know here, the series has different appeals to different people, and entwine with personal histories in unique ways. When asked what Star Wars means to him, Whitta had this to say:For me it\u2019s always been a boundless source of creative inspiration and just sheer magical escapism and joy. The first time I saw the original Star Wars I had the same reaction that so many film-makers of my generation had; that beyond being transported by the film, I immediately knew that whatever it was making me feel \u2014 that sense of awe and wonder \u2014 I wanted to pursue a career that would allow me to give that to other people.The pull that these outsized and mythic tales holds on the popular consciousness has created a devoted and mobilized fan base. The overall effect of this, in my opinion, is a net positive exchange between the creators and devotees. However, every now and again differences in expectations can lead to friction. The most recent \u2013 and discussed \u2013 fandom friction is that of the function of The Last Jedi in the context of the Sequel Trilogy, a subject on which Whitta does not mince words on:I suspect that I would have written a more fan service-driven film that would have appeased some of that noisy minority but ultimately would have been a lesser and less important film because of it. Frankly I\u2019m disgusted by the treatment that Rian has received, he\u2019s not just one of the most talented film-makers working today but one of the nicest people you could ever hope to meet in any walk of life, and both he and the film he made deserve far better.Strong words from a writer deeply embedded in the creation and mythos of Star Wars. Having been accepted into the Lucasfilm family Whitta now turns his attentions to bringing The Last Jedi from the silver screen to the sequential art format. When asked what that process is like \u2013 and what freedoms he felt he could take \u2013 he answered:Lucasfilm were very insistent that the comic not just be a straight replay of the movie in comics form, but that I try to find different ways to approach the existing material and to add new things that would give readers a different experience than the film itself\u2026A lot of the stuff I\u2019ve added or interpreted is really very minor but because it\u2019s Star Wars even little things are a big deal so something as minor as giving Admiral Ackbar a final moment before he died (I\u2019m a huge Ackbar fan!) was received in a major \u2014 and I\u2019m glad to say very positive \u2014 way by the fans.The entire interview is deeply interesting and well worth a read for the insight hungry fan.

{"content": "The Samsung Galaxy Note 9 has leaked again, this time in a video revealing a 512 GB variant and a new S Pen. The company is poised to launch the handset on Aug. 9. ( Samsung )Samsung can't seem to do a good job of keeping its latest flagship under wraps. The Galaxy Note 9 has leaked yet again.The device would supposedly be launched on Aug. 9 at the company's Unpacked event. The newest leak confirms the rumored storage boost.The Galaxy Note 9 will come in a whopping 512 GB variant, as previous rumors claim. The confirmation comes in the form of an allegedly leaked introduction video for the handset.As with all rumors and leaks, this one must be taken with a grain of salt, but to be fair, the video looks professionally made, complete with high-resolution renders and Samsung's signature typeface.Sammobile was the first to spot the leaked video, which has since been taken down from YouTube as of writing. The publication says it's likely Samsung uploaded the video by accident, as the video itself didn't even have an official title. Technically, it's everyone's first \"official\" look at the phone, and it highlights some of the newest upgrades the upcoming flagship has to offer.Bluetooth S Pen Rumors And 512 GB Galaxy Note 9 VariantFirst up is the S Pen, which rumors say will be more functional than its previous iterations. Apparently, it's getting a bunch of Bluetooth capabilities that will allow it to do useful tricks, such as controlling music playback and taking pictures remotely. These weren't mentioned in the video, though. If rumors are true, it would be the first time the S Pen gets radical upgrades. It's mainly used as a writing tool most of the time, but the aforementioned features could make it much more appealing to fans.The video also confirms that the phone supports up to 512 GB microSD cards \u2014 that means the Galaxy Note 9 can have as much as 1 TB of storage. Earlier this year, Samsung officially added support for 400 GB microSD cards on its mobile devices. It's nice to know things are moving fast in the storage department.Samsung Galaxy Note 9 RumorsOther rumors claim that the Galaxy Note 9 will have as much as 8 GB of RAM, but that's purely speculation. Details are thin at the moment, although it's safe to expect dual cameras, an AMOLED Infinity Display, a fingerprint sensor, an iris scanner, a headphone jack, and a dedicated Bixby button. With the launch event set at Aug. 9, it won't be long before these details are revealed, so stay tuned!", "id": "399"}

It also acquired Demimonde from uber-producer J.J. Abrams and The Nevers from beloved Buffy the Vampire Slayer creator Joss Whedon.Moffat will write the series. He will also serve as executive producer with Sue Vertue and Brian Minchin for their company, Hartswood Films. Warner Bros. Television will also produce.Of the adaptation, Moffat said,I read Audrey Niffenegger\u2019s The Time Traveler\u2019s Wife many years ago, and I fell in love with it\u2026 All these years later, the chance to adapt the novel itself, is a dream come true. The brave new world of long form television is now ready for this kind of depth and complexity. It\u2019s a story of happy ever after \u2013 but not necessarily in that order.Based on the 2003 novel by Audrey Niffenegger, The Time Traveler\u2019s Wife focuses on Clare, an artist, and Henry, a librarian. The pair fall in love and marry, but their marriage has a unique problem \u2014 Henry has a genetic condition that causes him to involuntarily travel through time. The show is said to be intricate, magical, and romantic.Want your voice heard? Join the Show Snob team!Of course, the HBO series won\u2019t the first time The Time Traveler\u2019s Wife has been adapted for the screen. In 2009, New Line, a division of Warner Bros. which still has the rights to the novel, produced a feature film of the story starring Eric Bana and Rachel Mc Adams.While the film was successful financially, it was panned by critics and only marginally more enjoyed by viewers.Yet, as Moffat observes, long-form television may be the perfect vehicle through which to do the complex story justice. Serialized TV provides the breathing room needed to make sure the audience can get to know and care about Clare and Henry and understand the intricacies of their situation.In fact, Moffat wrote a somewhat similar plot into Dr. Who during his tenure on that show in which the titular Doctor met his wife, River, across time and space at different points in both of their individual timelines.In addition to Dr. Who, Moffat is best known for co-creating and executive producing the Benedict Cumberbatch-starring Sherlock. He has won multiple Emmys and BAFTA Awards.Are you excited to see HBO\u2019s adaptation of The Time Traveler\u2019s Wife? Have your say in the comments.", "id": "400"}

This season, his game could resemble another young forward in Taurean Prince of the Atlanta Hawks.Drafted by the Minnesota Timberwolves with the 31st pick in the 2015 NBA Draft and then traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers on draft night, small forward Cedi Osman has shown flashes of being a dynamic offensive and defensive player since his days playing for Anadolu Efes in Turkey.His potential matters now more than ever and his role is going to expand quickly.It should go without saying but, with the departure of LeBron James, the Cavaliers are going to be a far different team next season. The changes they\u2019ll have to make will be many after a player of LeBron\u2019s magnitude departed and include offensive scheme, as Cavs head coach Tyronn Lue expressed during Las Vegas Summer League, as well as player roles.Osman, who has shown both point-forward ability and above-average three-point shooting, will see the ball in his hand more often.

Like Osman, he\u2019s shown an ability to handle the ball in spurts last season.Prince and Osman\u2019s abilities to defend multiple positions and be a secondary playmaker are key characteristics to each of their games.

{"content": "Many people feel isolated as they deal with loneliness and depression. Feeling alone and feeling like no one cares about you is a burden. According to scientists from Brigham Young University, loneliness and depression are associated with a 32% higher risk of mortality. It is in everyone\u2019s best interest to build their social networks and stay in touch with loved ones. Loneliness and depression are difficult to deal with, but it\u2019s possible to turn your life around and reconnect with the people you care about.When you are trying to overcome loneliness, turn to these encouraging quotes. They will show you a path forward from despair, loneliness and depression.     10 Perfect Quotes to Deal with Loneliness and Depression1. \u201cIf you don\u2019t think your anxiety, depression, sadness and stress impact your physical health, think again. All of these emotions trigger chemical reactions in your body, which can lead to inflammation and a weakened immune system. Learn how to cope, sweet friend. There will always be dark days.\u201dKris Carr     2. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing about depression: A human being can survive almost anything, as long as she sees the end in sight. But depression is so insidious, and it compounds daily, that it\u2019s impossible to ever see the end. The fog is like a cage without a key.\u201dElizabeth Wurtzel3. \u201cIf you know someone who\u2019s depressed, please resolve never to ask them why. Depression isn\u2019t a straightforward response to a bad situation; depression just is, like the weather.     Try to understand the blackness, lethargy, hopelessness, and loneliness they\u2019re going through. Be there for them when they come through the other side. It\u2019s hard to be a friend to someone who\u2019s depressed, but it is one of the kindest, noblest, and best things you will ever do.\u201dStephen Fry4. \u201cWhen you\u2019re lost in those woods, it sometimes takes you a while to realize that you are lost. For the longest time, you can convince yourself that you\u2019ve just wandered off the path, that you\u2019ll find your way back to the trailhead any moment now. Then night falls again and again, and you still have no idea where you are, and it\u2019s time to admit that you have bewildered yourself so far off the path that you don\u2019t even know from which direction the sun rises anymore.\u201dElizabeth Gilbert5. \u201cListen to the people who love you. Believe that they are worth living for even when you don\u2019t believe it. Seek out the memories depression takes away and project them into the future. Be brave; be strong; take your pills. Exercise because it\u2019s good for you even if every step weighs a thousand pounds. Eat when food itself disgusts you. Reason with yourself when you have lost your reason.\u201dAndrew Solomon6. \u201cWhy do people have to be this lonely? What\u2019s the point of it all? Millions of people in this world, all of them yearning, looking to others to satisfy them, yet isolating themselves. Why? Was the earth put here just to nourish human loneliness?\u201dHaruki Murakami7. \u201cThe best remedy for those who are afraid, lonely or unhappy is to go outside, somewhere where they can be quite alone with the heavens, nature and God.\u201dAnne Frank, The Diary of a Young Girl8. \u201cSome of us go full circle. Some of us blindly go nowhere. The circle doesn\u2019t have to be very large to make a point, kick your ass and/or be entertaining. Remember that and stay light. Even the deaf know good music when they hear it.\u201dJason Mraz9. \u201cAll paths are the same: they lead nowhere. Does this path have a heart? If it does, the path is good; if it doesn\u2019t, it is of no use. Both paths lead nowhere; but one has a heart, the other doesn\u2019t. One makes for a joyful journey; as long as you follow it, you are one with it. The other will make you curse your life. One makes you strong; the other weakens you.\u201dCarlos Castaneda, The Teachings of Don Juan: A Yaqui Way of Knowledge10. \u201cYou must draw from that strength. You must increase it. And you must hold on to it because sometimes that small glimmer of inner strength is all that we have to help us press forward through the darkness.\u201dMorgan Rhodes, Falling KingdomsFinal ThoughtsWhen you take these quotes to heart, you can learn ways to overcome loneliness. These quotes encourage you to make your own way in the world and to be true to yourself. Trust in your inner strength. Stay in touch with your friends and family. If you don\u2019t have anyone to turn to, join an interest group and try to make some new friends. Loneliness and depression don\u2019t have to rule your life. You can fight back against them and bring sunlight back to your existence.", "id": "403"}
{"content": "July 27--SAN JOSE -- Deputy Don Morrissey's resignation was a long-sought victory for embattled Sheriff Laurie Smith, who is seeking her sixth term in office without the support of the rank-and-file officers who belong to the Deputy Sheriffs' Association. Several African-American deputies, as well as the president of the local chapter of the NAACP, had called on Morrissey to resign.Morrissey will lose the $800 a month stipend that the union paid him to serve. The current vice president of the DSA, Roger Winslow, will serve as interim president until an election is held later this year. In a brief written statement, Winslow said the leadership of the group will \"be guided by a steadfast commitment to the safety and security of our members, accountability across our department, and responsive engagement with the diverse community we are privileged to serve.\"In a letter to DSA members late Thursday, Morrissey said he hoped his resignation would pave the way for the group to win back community trust \"on which every one of our deputies depends.\"\"Within our association and the broader law enforcement community, leaders must not only set an example, but demand accountability when we fall short,\" he wrote. \"That accountability must start with me.\"The statement was met with strong words late Thursday by the sheriff, who criticized Morrissey for failing to fully own up to his misconduct.\"Mr. Morrissey continues to deflect, distort, and distract from his complicity (in the exchange of) racist, homophobic, and sexually assaultive text messages,\" Smith said. \"His latest attempt at reputational self-preservation disparages the entire Sheriff's Office with its reckless and unfounded accusation of institutional bias. Unbelievably, he then appoints himself as the individual to rebuild trust with the community, trust that he, as an individual, has broken.\"Give me a break -- the public is a hell of a lot smarter than Mr. Morrissey gives them credit for,\" the statement concluded, \"and they will see right through his latest smoke screen.\"Smith fired Lance Scimeca, former president of the correctional officers union, shortly after the racist texts first surfaced in 2015 during an unrelated investigation for sending some of the most explicit slurs.Morrissey had been cleared by an independent African-American investigator of sending overtly racist texts, but Smith stripped him of his sergeant's stripes in 2016 on the grounds that he failed to stop the guards and Scimeca from sharing the bigoted messages both on the job and off duty. Morrissey did admit to chiming in -- without using any racist language -- to two strings of messages riddled with racist slurs against Vietnamese and African-Americans.The texts referred to Vietnamese as \"g---,\" Jews as \"k---,\" and black people as \"n----\" and \"yard apes.\" In one batch, Scimeca and others made numerous references using slurs against blacks and other thinly veiled bigoted remarks like \"Happy Birthday, Buckwheat.\" They also used homophobic and transphobic slurs, as well as images of swastikas and Ku Klux Klan members in pointy white hats.It was the second time Smith demoted Morrissey. About five years ago, she knocked him down a notch from lieutenant to sergeant after investigators concluded he had spent more than an hour a day looking at pornography on a work computer and had tried to persuade an employee to conceal the evidence.Rev. Jethroe Moore, president of the local chapter of the NAACP, said Thursday he was pleased Morrissey resigned but said more work had to be done to reduce prejudice in the sheriff's office. The pastor and Morrissey had met to discuss the situation prior to his resignation, Moore said. Morrissey also met with other community leaders.\"I'm glad he stepped down for the sake of the union and the community,\" Moore said, adding that he plans to ask county supervisors to institute sensitivity training for sworn officers in the agency. \"It's a dire need for many of them.\"This news organization first reported the existence of the texts in 2015, touching off a wave of outrage and horror in the community, which was already reeling from the death of a mentally ill inmate at the hands of three jail guards who were ultimately convicted of murder. A trove of new texts surfaced earlier this year and was reported by Metro, prompting Morrissey to resign as secretary of the Peace Officers Research Association of California.The organization had sent out a statement faulting him for not disclosing his involvement in the text scandal, claiming they learned of it through the Metro story, even though the information had been readily available since this news organization reported on the arbitration battle six months ago.------Here are two letters. The first was sent by Morrissey to all members of the Deputy Sheriff's Association about 4 p.m. Thursday. The second was an earlier draft that appears to have gone just to the local branch of the NAACP, not the DSA members.Dear DSA Member,Over the last several years, our Association, indeed all of law enforcement, has been engaged in a long overdue discussion on the need to combat racism, sexism, homophobia and other forms of bias and harassment in our departments.As the frontline professionals entrusted to protect and serve a proud and diverse community, I recognize that we must hold ourselves to the highest standard. Within our association and the broader law enforcement community, leaders must not only set an example, but demand accountability when we fall short.That accountability must start with me. And that's why today I am announcing my resignation as your Association President.As media reports about shameful conduct at our jail have resurfaced in recent weeks, it has been a very emotional time for many of us. At the General Membership Meeting on the tenth, I was moved by members' very personal stories, concerns, anger, and frustrations.I left this meeting even more committed to addressing systemic issues regarding bias and the lack of reporting within our department. I met with our DSA Board in an effort to identify potential procedural reforms, and engaged prominent community leaders for input and assistance in not only addressing issues of bias, but rebuilding the community trust on which every one of our deputies depends.Ultimately, I believe that each of those steps is not nearly enough, without also giving our department and our association the opportunity to turn the page with new leadership.While I regret the unfortunate events that brought us to today, I am hopeful that this Association will keep working to realize the highest ideals of public service at the heart of our mission, to include eliminating all forms of discrimination and harassment from our department and to improve the level of communication with members and the community as a whole.Sincerely,Don Morrissey------Here is the previous letter:The past few weeks have been very emotional for me and for many of you. At the General Membership Meeting on the tenth, I heard the very personal stories, concerns, anger, and frustrations of several of our members. I also heard the complicated feelings of both disappointment and support that moved me deeply.In the light of the meeting I was even more committed to doing what I could to heal the issues that arose. I met with the DSA Board and identified what I thought was an answer to the systemic issues regarding biases and the lack of reporting that still remain at the department. Furthermore, I met with prominent community leaders to discuss the issues, my proposed program, and asked for their assistance.With that said, I have revisited my decision and feel that resigning as President of the DSA may best serve the membership at this time.I am proud of the accomplishments your Board and I have made over the past several year. We have negotiated and received arguably the best contract in DSA history (including a 26% pay increase), purchased and renovated our own building, began hosting courses at our building, increased member and community events, just to name a few.I am also hopeful the DSA Board will continue to improve the level of communication with members who feel they have experienced or witnessed bias, racism, sexism, homophobia, retaliation, or any other form of harassment or discrimination at the department.I ask you, please if you see something, say something. Our inaction can hurt those around you as well as our profession though it is not our intent.___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "404"}
{"content": "July 27--Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan plan to announce a proposed court agreement Friday afternoon that would govern reforms in the troubled Chicago Police Department.A news conference is scheduled for 2 p.m., and city officials are holding briefings for attorneys and other stakeholders beforehand, sources said.Asked at an early Friday morning news conference to address whether the proposed consent decree would be made public Friday afternoon, police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said, \"I knew someone was going to ask that.\" He then discussed the work that went into the forthcoming document.\"This is the result of a lot of negotiations with the Police Department, the mayor's office and the attorney general,\" Johnson said as Emanuel looked on at an event to announce that a new crop of officers would be hitting the streets. \"And look, we -- the mayor and myself -- made a commitment to you a couple years ago that we would reform the way the Chicago police did business.\"We started this two years ago,\" he said. \"So a lot of what you're going to see are things that are already in place.\"Emanuel then took the mic at the Central District police station in the South Loop and touted the measures already taken to overhaul officer training and equipment.\"This is a culmination of a lot of other things that have been happening with oversight, but it's out of the commitment we've made collectively to the public that we're going to have a Police Department that reflects our community policing values and principles,\" Emanuel said.In March, city officials and Madigan's office agreed to allow groups including the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois and Black Lives Matter Chicago to give input and criticize the proposed order, and those groups can seek to use the courts to enforce the final consent decree. The deal imposes a deadline of Sept. 1 for the city and Madigan's office to file a proposed order with Judge Robert Dow, who will then hold hearings involving stakeholders and eventually rule on a final consent decree.Meanwhile, the Chicago Fraternal Order of Police, whose leaders want the litigation over the consent decree dismissed, are seeking to intervene in the case, though Dow has yet to rule on whether the union can get involved.The impending fight over the final document comes at a consequential moment in city politics and policing.On Sept. 5, Officer Jason Van Dyke is scheduled to go on trial on murder charges in the shooting of African-American 17-year-old Laquan McDonald. The court-ordered November 2015 release of video of Van Dyke shooting the teenager 16 times touched off furious street protests rooted in long-standing complaints about police abuse, primarily from African-Americans and Latinos. The controversy spurred efforts to overhaul the department, and an eventual consent decree likely would mark the most sweeping and long-lasting political consequence of McDonald's recorded shooting.Illustrating the volatility that continues to surround policing in Chicago, the fatal police shooting of an armed man in the South Shore neighborhood July 14 touched off violent clashes between protesters and police.Van Dyke's trial and efforts to hammer out a court order are poised to fall in the last months of Emanuel's campaign for re-election. The mayor faces multiple challengers who could use his efforts at police reform to cast him as either indifferent to police abuse or too eager to restrain police in a city riven by violent crime.Madigan is not running for re-election, which means one of two candidates -- Democrat Kwame Raoul or Republican Erika Harold -- would inherit a role in the consent decree litigation.The Emanuel administration has traveled a circuitous route to the proposed consent decree.As the McDonald video sparked a political crisis 2 1/2 years ago, Emanuel at first rejected calls for an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice but reversed himself as the concept gained support from other political officials. The resulting federal investigation led to a report released in January 2017 that described a comprehensively broken Police Department in which badly trained cops have practiced brutality and misconduct with little to fear from their supervisors or a largely ineffectual disciplinary system.That report emerged in the last days of an Obama administration that moved aggressively to reform local police agencies, and Emanuel voiced support for a consent decree. But the Trump administration has shown no interest in intervening in local police agencies, and Emanuel last summer backed away from his support for a consent decree. The mayor argued he could bring meaningful reform to the department through an out-of-court agreement with the Trump administration involving a monitor, but activists and former Justice Department lawyers blasted that proposal, voicing skepticism that significant change would come without a judge to impose it.In August 2017, Madigan sued the city to force a consent decree, and Emanuel said he would negotiate toward one. Black Lives Matter Chicago and the ACLU, meanwhile, brought their own lawsuits seeking to compel changes in the department. The Emanuel administration and Madigan's office reached an in-court deal giving those activist groups a role in creating and enforcing a consent decree.In recent days, attorneys for City Hall and Madigan's office told Dow they'd reached consensus on most topics but could not agree on whether Chicago police should have to document incidents in which officers point guns at people. Lawyers for Madigan's office wanted the incidents documented, and lawyers for the city apparently disagreed.The implementation of the consent decree is expected to be overseen by an independent monitor who reports to the judge. Typically, consent decrees over law enforcement agencies have been overseen by a lead monitor along with a team of deputies, often academics, lawyers and former police chiefs.On Tuesday morning, Emanuel also emphasized what he said were attempts to involve police in the reform process. \"And things like additional training, wellness, promotions, things officers for years and decades have been asking for, you will see -- when we're ready -- encapsulated in that agreement.\"Chicago Tribune's John Byrne contributed.This is a developing story.___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "405"}

He should be back in the action this weekend, and based on the status of the injury, he should be able to pick up where he left off. Doctson was having a great training camp before his injury, showing off the high-flying athleticism that got him selected in the first round by the Redskins back in 2016.Nevertheless, Doctson will be out for at least a day or two, leaving someone else to take his place at the X-receiver slot. In the midst of this brief window of opportunity, look for Robert Davis, Brian Quick, and Maurice Harris to get more first-team reps in Doctson\u2019s stead, as the team looks to choose two out of those three players to take the fifth and sixth spots at receiver.In other injury news, Matt Ioannidis has reportedly been dealing with a turf toe issue throughout camp.

{"content": "Aug. 02--(CLICK HERE, if you are unable to view this photo gallery or video on your mobile device.)Former 49ers great Dwight Clark was eulogized by many in a private memorial service in San Francisco on Wednesday, including ex-49ers owner Eddie DeBartolo.Here's what DeBartolo had to say at Grace Cathedral about Clark, who passed away at age 61 in June from complications from ALS:Good morning, everyone.I was honored that near the end of his life, Dwight asked me to speak today.But I have to admit, at a time like this, it's hard to find the right words. So I decided to begin with Dwight's own words:\"It was just a great life.\" . . . . . . . .And you know, it really, really was.That's why we're here today, to celebrate the life of Dwight Clark even as we mourn his passing.Of course, no one has been defined by a singular moment more than Dwight.He is forever remembered for \"The Catch.\" . . . you may have heard about it.In the NFC Championship game against the Cowboys, Joe Montana threw the pass so high that it looked like he was throwing the ball away. But he knew Dwight, at 6-foot-4, would find a way and he leaped so high in the sky to make the game-winning play that began our 49ers dynasty.Dwight was asked about it many times and always said what a perfect pass it was.When he would tell that story, Joe would always say, 'Well, then, maybe it should be called 'The Throw.' \" And flashing his trademark smile, Dwight would say, 'Joe, at least give me my one play.' \"It's one of the most iconic moments in NFL history.And what I think all of us here today should do is remember the many, many special moments that Dwight shared with us all during his life.When I first met Dwight after Bill Walsh selected him in the 10th round from Clemson, he had this Southern accent and he was so incredibly good looking with a big smile and infectious laugh. I knew we would instantly be friends.In 1979, I was only 32 years old when Dwight and Joe came to the 49ers. They were like my little brothers. I told them to call me Eddie, but Dwight always insisted on calling me 'Boss.'They would meet me at the airport when I would fly in from Youngstown and we would go to the team hotel, sneak down to the bar with Freddie Solomon and have a couple of drinks.Once, I had the idea to try and personally negotiate their contracts without using their agents, so I invited them to my home in Youngstown. My friend Carmen Policy, who was our general counsel and team president, didn't like the idea but he went along with it. Carmen left around 11 p.m. that night. Dwight, Joe and I shot pool and drank tequila -- probably way more than we should have. . . .Well . . . I got the deals done.When Carmen saw us at breakfast, sort of beaten up from the night before, he learned I had paid Joe a million dollars and Dwight $500,000 dollars.Then Carmen's jaw dropped when he saw Dwight drive off to Carolina in my brand new silver Ferrari.Carmen looked at me in shock and asked, \"What the hell happened?\"All I could say was \"They won.\"I have pictures at our ranch in Montana of those two. Joe signed it \"Thanks a million.\" Dwight wrote, \"Thanks a half a million.\"That was Dwight, or D.C. as so many of his friends and teammates called him.Dwight had a nickname for everyone. Jerry Rice was \"World,\" because he had never seen anyone with his skill set in the world. Freddie Solomon was \"Casper\" (like the ghost). And Ronnie Lott was always \"Bo Bo.\"Ronnie joined our team in 1980. He didn't say a lot as a rookie. He and Dwight would become extremely close.After we won the Super Bowl in Detroit, Dwight gave Ronnie one of his great big bear hugs he was known for and said, \"What's up Bo Bo?\"It was after that, Ronnie said he realized there are some people who love you unconditionally. That's how Dwight loved everyone.What a moment.A lot of words have been used to describe Dwight. a Southern gentleman. Selfless. Handsome. Humble. Caring. Courageous. Loving. Funny. The one I think that describes him best is loyal. Dwight Clark was loyal.If you met him once, you felt you had known him your whole life. You never forgot that moment.My wife Candy and our entire family adored Dwight. My youngest daughter Nikki fell for him instantly. He was her first boy crush. Lisa's office was next door to Dwight's when he was general manager, and she ran the 49ers Foundation. Lisa would pop into his office every day to ask a million questions about football, and Dwight was so patient and gracious with her.Tiffanie would play Space Invaders and Pac-Man with him at the team hotel on Saturday nights. When UC Berkeley played Clemson in a bowl game, they had a bet and the loser had to shave their head if their team lost. Thank God, Clemson lost. Tiffanie wasn't going to make him shave his head, but Dwight did it anyway . . . because that's who he was.Talk about moments. Who can forget him wearing the coyote coat to our Super Bowl parade? He was our Joe Namath, without the pantyhose. But he never lived down the Adidas poster with the short red pants and tank top.Dwight actually liked playing the bad guy. He loved vigilante movies and he watched a lot of them with his friend Rick Winters. Dwight was our Clint Eastwood. There was a safety in Atlanta, Scott Case, and Dwight would rather hit him all day long than catch a pass.Dwight did everything well. He was a great basketball player in high school. I think he could've been a professional singer. I don't know if he was as good as Huey Lewis, but he could've given the news a run for their money. He was always the one who brought the CDs of the latest music on the team plane.Dwight had every gift but enough years on this earth. When he was diagnosed with ALS, he knew it was a battle he could never win. He fought like hell. He cherished every single moment every single day.In the end, no matter how tired he was, Dwight rallied. He loved the Tuesday lunches with his teammates in the Bay Area, Dwight Clark Day at Levi Stadium and the gathering we had in April with our 49ers family in Montana.Weakened by this horrible disease, Dwight didn't want to waste one moment. He gutted it out.We talked about all the games and told some lies about each other. He laughed at the stories of me fighting with fans of the other teams in the stands at away games.Matt Maiocco collected hundreds of letters from fans and their memories of The Catch. Dwight had a special relationship with 49ers fans. One even sent some blades of grass he collected that day in 1981 from Candlestick where The Catch was made.When I told Dwight I had the goal post from that end zone at Candlestick moved to my ranch in Montana, he couldn't believe it. On the last day of our Montana reunion, Dwight rode his wheelchair from my barn all the way to the goal post. We all had pictures taken in front of it.It was one of the final times we would all be together. But even then, Dwight was leaving us all more special moments with him to cherish forever.Dwight's last days were hard. I talked to him nearly every day and Ronnie and I were with him when he passed. His wife Kelly is such a loving wife who cared for him deeply. She rose to the occasion, every moment of every day. She was the doctor, the nurse and more than his wife. She was his sweetheart.He loved you Kelly, and he loved his family. He loved his children, Casey, Mack and Riley. He loved his brother Jeff and his family. He loved his nephews and beautiful nieces. Meredith, you know Dwight loved you so very much. He adored his dogs, who were with him when he passed.I know he loved me and I sure loved him.ALS took so much from Dwight but it couldn't break his spirit and it didn't dare touch his great smile.I'm so very thankful I have so many moments he left me to cherish. How many of us can say that our best moments were as magnificent as his?Today, I can imagine Dwight getting an earful from Bill Walsh, and he and Freddie Solomon listening to Bill go on and on about \"Red left slot sprint right option.\"Although he left all of us way too soon, I know that Dwight was ready to soar again . . . this time he has touched the heavens.God bless you, Dwight. We love you and we always will.___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "407"}
{"content": "July 31--With Tuesday's 3 p.m. trade deadline growing near, here are a few important factors involving the Cubs' efforts to upgrade:Any trade partners besides the Rangers? If the Cubs are looking for more relief help, the Marlins and Rays are obvious targets. A debate among the Marlins may be when the value of relievers Kyle Barraclough and Adam Conley, both arbitration-eligible next season, is highest.More teams could decide to become sellers instead of buyers, which could flood the market. But the Marlins could try to get more teams involved if they wait until the offseason.The Cubs don't appear to have the right mix of high-ceiling prospects who are nearly ready for the majors to satisfy any deal involving starter Chris Archer of the Rays. But Brad Ziegler of the Marlins or Sergio Romo of the Rays, each a submarine-style reliever, could be an effective short-term, affordable fit.The Cubs examined the Padres' roster even after left-hander Brad Hand was dealt to the Indians, and a source confirmed several teams are interested in relievers Kirby Yates (who pitched for Cubs manager Joe Maddon with the Rays) and Craig Stammen, as well as outfielders Hunter Renfroe and Travis Jankowski.What's the timetable for in-house reinforcements? President Theo Epstein and general manager Jed Hoyer are mindful of the injuries that struck the Red Sox around or after the 2006 trade deadline, so they don't want to waste an opportunity.The expectation is that reliever Anthony Bass could return first from the 10-day disabled list in a week. The pain in closer Brandon Morrow's right biceps virtually has vanished, but he likely will need at least two weeks to show he's sharp and pain-free.Third baseman Kris Bryant likely will follow a timetable similar to Morrow's to ensure there's no recurrence of left shoulder pain.There's no rush to bring back left-hander Drew Smyly or reliever Justin Hancock from their arm injuries before Sept. 1.What about the schedule? The Cubs' three scheduled off days Aug. 9, 13 and 20 are just as crucial as their stretch of 23 daily games starting Aug. 21. The days off apply to players such as Anthony Rizzo and Ben Zobrist as much as a rotation that must maximize the extra days of rest before the grueling stretch.Losing an original off day Aug. 30 to a makeup game with the Braves prevents the Cubs from setting up their rotation for 14 consecutive games against the Braves, Phillies, Brewers and Nationals. But with so many left-handers in the rotation, this might not matter.After Sept. 9, the Cubs leave Chicago for only three games, Sept. 17-19 at Arizona. But their final seven games at home are against the resurgent Pirates and the wacky Cardinals.Wild-card factors: Would the Cubs be tempted finally to trade one of their young position players for a starting pitcher under team control? The pursuit of young, controllable starting pitching via trade has been a goal since utility player Emilio Bonifacio and left-hander James Russell were dealt to the Braves four seasons ago for catcher Victor Caratini -- their last trade of the rebuilding stage.The emergence of versatile infielder David Bote adds depth to the Cubs, although they might need to keep their young position players until they receive confirmation Bryant should be healthy for most of the remainder of the regular season. Zobrist is playing younger than his 37 years, so keeping him fresh is a priority.It wouldn't hurt the Cubs to add a speedster before Sept. 1, when all players eligible for the postseason must be in the organization. For example, Epstein and Hoyer added Dave Roberts to the Red Sox to help them win the first of the team's three World Series rings this century. the as Dave Roberts helped Epstein and Hoyer receive their first of three World Series rings in 2004 with the Red Sox.Adding Chris Gimenez or another catcher to the 40-man roster before Sept. 1 would be a wise decision, as the acquisition of Alex Avila last summer really became significant after Willson Contreras missed a month because of a strained hamstring nine days after the 2017 trade deadline.mgonzales@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "408"}
{"content": "For those who are in an unhealthy or difficult relationship, your partner may be the cause of your issues. In many cases, the individual can be narcissistic, which can have a significant impact on your well-being and state of mind. You may have developed insecurities in the relationship or feel emotionally abused by the individual.Some of the most common signs of a narcissistic partner include a superiority or an entitlement that they carry. They may also have a lack of empathy and have a need to control or always strive for perfectionism, which can make the relationship unbalanced and can lead to unhappiness. If you\u2019re ready to leave the relationship, there are a few critical steps to take.     Here\u2019s how to leave a narcissistic partner:1. Establish BoundariesIf your partner has a narcissistic personality disorder, you may be used to not feeling respected or allowing them to take control of different situations. They may be the one who makes decisions in the relationship or determines your future together. When you break up with your partner, you can expect them to do what they can to change your mind or convince you that you\u2019re making the wrong decision. You\u2019ll need to establish boundaries to protect yourself and prevent them from convincing you to go back to the relationship. In some cases, you may need to block their phone number or avoid seeing them until you no longer have feelings for them or aren\u2019t tempted to get back together. Zero contact is important in the first few months or year after you break up because you\u2019re in a vulnerable position where you can easily be lured back in with validation from your ex-partner. You\u2019ll need to take on the mental state of pretending that they never existed and spend time with family members or friends to stay distracted.     You may need to say no to them and stand your ground to ensure that you aren\u2019t prone to returning. Make it a point to look towards the future and know that something better is coming to ensure that you don\u2019t feel like the individual is what you deserve.2. Process Your FeelingsEnding a relationship with a narcissistic partner can be emotionally challenging and can be difficult to move on from once you break up with the individual. Allow yourself to process your feelings to ensure that you can heal and stand firm in your decision and avoid anxiety or stress during the transition. You\u2019ll also need to shift your thoughts and stop thinking about the abuse that you endured, which can make it easy to live in the past. Instead, think about what you want for your future and begin making goals that allow you to look forward to meeting new people or returning to your hobbies or passions. Without processing your feelings, it can be easy to return to the relationship or find another narcissistic partner to date.3. Build a Social NetworkBuilding a social network of friends is necessary to avoid feeling alone or isolated after you end your relationship. Make it a point to stay busy and have fun, which will allow you to think less about your ex and enjoy your time with other people. You may want to join a gym or find dance classes to take where you\u2019ll have an easier time meeting other people and forming relationships with people who treat you better.     Making connections online in Facebook groups or online forums will also prove to be effective to ensure that you can find people in the local area.4. Be Kind to YourselfBeing kind to yourself is necessary to break free from your partner if they suffer from a narcissistic personality disorder. You\u2019ll need to forgive yourself for allowing them to treat you poorly and for remaining in the relationship. Practice self-talk, which will build yourself up and can allow you to have more confidence in who you are as an individual. Allow it to be a learning lesson that teaches you how to choose healthier relationships and to avoid being controlled or emotionally abused again.5. Don\u2019t Practice HonestyAlthough honesty is important when you\u2019re in a relationship with a healthy individual, breaking up with a narcissist will require a different approach to prevent them from becoming defensive or manipulative. Act like the decision is best for the both of you and don\u2019t make it a big deal. Avoid assigning blame to prevent it from turning into conflict.Breaking up with a narcissistic is never an easy process but can allow you to break free of the relationship with the right tips followed. By standing your ground and understanding that you deserve more, it\u2019ll be easier to move on with your life and avoid looking back.", "id": "409"}
{"content": "July 28--The trade deadline is getting close, and the same would seem to be true for the White Sox's two best prospects. But general manager Rick Hahn continues to insist that Eloy Jimenez and Michael Kopech still have work to do in Triple A.\"One thing I can promise is that our focus is unwavering in terms of putting this organization in the best spot for the long term,\" Hahn said. \"We're not going to take any shortcuts or make any short-term, satisfying moves that potentially could cause any impact on these guys not meeting their potential.\"While the arrival of Jimenez and Kopech could lessen the pain of nights such as Friday, when Reynaldo Lopez served up five home runs and walked four in 4 1/3 innings in a 10-5 loss to the Blue Jays, the Sox front office unsurprisingly remains focused on 2019 and beyond, not salvaging this summer.But it is fun to think what the Sox will have when they do unwrap Jimenez, who is hitting .328 with 16 homers and a .958 OPS between Double A and Triple A, and Kopech, who in his last three starts has struck out 24 and allowed four earned runs in 17 innings.\"Both of them are going to be really amazing players,\" said reliever Tyler Danish, who was promoted from Charlotte on Friday. \"They're going to have special futures here.\"Kopech has gotten better in each start I've seen him in the last month-and-a-half. Eloy's obviously a special human being in what he does. You see it on a daily basis.\"Yoan Moncada was promoted from Triple A shortly after Hahn made a series of midseason trades last season. But there's little feeling that he's currently working on an Avisail Garcia trade, which would open the door for Jimenez.\"Those guys are going to tell us when they're ready, and when they're ready there's going to be opportunity for them in Chicago\"' Hahn said. \"It's up to us to figure out how to create that opportunity, but we'll figure it out. We're not going to wait for the market to allow us to free a spot for a guy if it's time for his development to take that next step.\"Finding a spot for Kopech would not appear that difficult.Lopez appears to be tiring in his first full season as a major-league starter as he has allowed 21 earned runs in 212/3 innings over his last four starts. His ERA has climbed from 3.68 to 4.57 over that stretch.A move to a six-man rotation would ease the strain on all the Sox starters down the stretch, but there's no guarantee the Sox will promote Kopech in September.Curtis Granderson and Lourdes Gurriel Jr. homered on the second and third pitches of the game, and Randal Grichuk homered in the second inning as the Blue Jays built a 5-0 lead that grew to 10-1 before the Sox started pecking away at it.Gurriel hit his second homer of the game in the fourth and Kendrys Morales hit one off Lopez in the fifth.Both manager Rick Renteria and pitching coach Don Cooper were ejected in the top of the first after third-base umpire Fieldin Culbreth ruled that Morales had checked his swing on a 3-2 pitch. Joe McEwing ran the game in Renteria's place, with bullpen coach Curt Hasler coming in to replace Cooper.Phil Rogers is a freelance reporter for the Chicago Tribune.___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "410"}
{"content": "July 30--The anti-violence march planned for Thursday on Lake Shore Drive and the march that shut down the Dan Ryan Expressway earlier this month are part of a national and international trend of using transportation infrastructure as a stage for protests.This kind of protest has the advantage of being hard to ignore, since it disrupts the daily routines of those who might not otherwise pay attention to the issues being addressed. It also tends to draw more media attention than a picket in front of a building.\"It's definitely been a trend in the last four or five years, literally taking it to the streets and taking over freeways and disrupting people,\" said Stefan Bradley, chair of the African-American studies department at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles.Bradley said some people criticize the tactic because it risks turning off moderates who may have been sympathetic to the cause but are inconvenienced at being held up in traffic. But disruption is the point, he said.\"It's the idea -- to draw attention to particular issues,\" Bradley said. He said gun violence, particularly in Chicago, has become almost normalized and a nonissue outside of communities of people of color. \"By shutting down the Dan Ryan or by taking the demonstration to Lake Shore Drive, people are raising awareness about the issue and not making it an issue that black and brown people have to solve, but rather Chicago and Americans have to solve,\" Bradley said. \"Everybody is affected by this.\"The Rev. Gregory Livingston, who is one of the organizers of the Lake Shore Drive protest, said he wants it during rush hour on the wealthy North Side, on the first day of Lollapalooza, to draw attention to problems seen in poorer areas on the South and West sides.\"I believe there are many people in this city who don't know the raw deal other people are getting,\" Livingston said.Examples of highway and other transportation protests are numerous, and everywhere:--In May, people with disabilities blocked access to and from a major highway in Tel Aviv, Israel, resulting in traffic jams. The protesters wanted higher disability stipends.--In Olympia, Wash., in November, anti-fracking activists blocked train tracks.--In St. Louis last October, protesters walked onto Interstate 64 and blocked traffic as part of a demonstration over the acquittal of a former police officer in the shooting death of Anthony Lamar Smith, a black man.--Last September, anti-fascism protesters walked onto U.S. Highway 101 in Los Angeles during rush hour.--July 2016 saw multiple highway protests in response to police-involved shootings of black men, with activists blocking on-ramps onto the San Francisco Bay Bridge, Interstate 94 in St. Paul, Minn., and the Interstate 75/85 Downtown Connector in Atlanta. Here in Chicago, a protest that month briefly shut down the northbound Dan Ryan at 55th Street.--In Chicago last September, homeless activists briefly blocked inbound Lake Shore Drive to protest the removal of a homeless camp at Wilson Avenue. Protesters also briefly snarled traffic on Lake Shore Drive and the Eisenhower Expressway in December 2014 to protest police killings in Missouri and New York City.In response to multiple demonstrations in recent years, lawmakers in some states pushed to criminalize protests that interfered with traffic.The idea of taking to the streets is not new -- the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. led the 1965 march onto the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Ala. The clash on the bridge between peaceful protesters and police using tear gas and billy clubs was televised around the world.Bradley noted that many people now are sympathetic toward the 1960s civil rights protests, but \"they don't understand how wildly annoying Martin Luther King was and the protesters were.\"\"If it had been left to letter-writing campaigns and phone calls, nothing would have ever gotten done,\" Bradley said.Livingston recalled a story his grandfather used to tell about a dog sitting on a porch whining because he was sitting on a nail. Asked why the dog didn't move, the grandfather replied, \"It doesn't hurt bad enough yet.\"Livingston said change comes from discomfort with the way things are, and the protest will help \"redistribute the pain.\" The march will block Lake Shore Drive at Belmont Avenue, and then move up Clark Street to Wrigley Field, Livingston said.\"Sometimes you have to irritate people to get them to move,\" said Livingston, a former City Council candidate. He is demanding the resignation of both Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Chicago police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, along with economic investments on the South and West sides. He said he disagreed with the strategy of the Dan Ryan protest, held in an area where people were already familiar with the problem of violence.Chicago Police Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in an email that police are meeting with organizers to learn about their plans.\"While I don't have any specifics that I can share as of yet, we are committed to protecting individuals' right to demonstrate while also balancing the potential traffic and public safety implications,\" Guglielmi said.mwisniewski@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "411"}
{"content": "Aug. 01--Here are five tips that will help in your enjoyment of the 2018 Outside Lands Music and Arts Festival, which features The Weeknd, Florence + the Machine, Janet Jackson and dozens of other acts Aug. 10-12 at Golden Gate Park in San Francisco. For more information, visit www.sfoutsidelands.com1 Limit your cross-festival tripsOutside Lands covers a massive area of the park and you can rack up quite an impressive number of steps on your Fitbit if you keep moving from one side of the festival to the other. In particular, it can get quite tiring continually walking between the Lands End and Twin Peaks stages.To save on steps, focus on going back and forth between the more closely grouped Lands End and Sutro stages or the Twin Peaks and Panhandle stages, limiting the cross-festival excursions for can't-miss acts. Your feet will thank you.2. Go early in the dayOf course, the bigger-name acts go on later in the day. Take that factor out of the equation, however, and our favorite time to be at the festival is during the first few hours after the gates open. It's vastly less crowded, which translates to shorter lines for the bathrooms and concessions as well as easier access to prime viewing areas of the stages.The weather can be nicer at that time as well -- although, let's face it, you never know what your going to get in that regard at Golden Gate Park (in other words, bring layers of clothing). Plus, there are usually some cool acts playing earlier in the day. For example, Mikky Ekko opens Lands End stage at noon on Aug. 10; Kikagaku Moyo is on Sutro stage at noon on Aug. 11; and Dick Stusso takes the Panhandle stage at noon on Aug. 12.3. Laugh it upA few laughs are always good. And you'll likely find more than just a few if you attend a set at the Barbary, which is the festival's spot for comedy and improv. This year's lineup is particularly promising, with Michelle Wolf, Jonathan Van Ness, Paul Scheer and more. So don't just show up at the Barbary a few minutes before the set assuming you'll get in. Instead, comedy fans will want to plan ahead.Tickets are made available two hours prior to each show at the Barbary Reservations Tent in Marx Meadow. So, get swing by early and pick up your tickets (note: there is a two-ticket limit per wristband). Then head back to the Barbary at least 15 minutes prior to show time.Those without tickets/reservations can wait in the standby lines up to 30 minutes before the set. But entry is not guaranteed for those in the standby line.4. Feast in the TreesWant to take your Outside Lands experience to the next level? Well, here's just the ticket for Chase Sapphire Preferred and Reserve cardmembers, who have the exclusive opportunity to get tickets for the 2018 Feast in the Trees. The events include a four-course family-style meal with beer and wine pairings. Here's the Feast in the Trees schedule.Aug. 10th 7-8:15 p.m.Feast in the Trees with Chef Hugh AchesonFour-course family-style dinner, paired with beer and wine.Aug. 11, 1-2 p.m.International SmokeThree-course family-style lunch, paired with beer and wineAug. 12th 3-4 p.m.Sweet Berry Wine with Las Jaras WineWine tasting with Las Jaras, plus bites from Tartine Manufactory.5. Have a planThe festival features more than 80 acts performing on multiple stages. And that's just in reference to the music. There are also plenty of comedians and other entertainment options at Outside Lands. To maximize your time at the park, and not miss the best acts, it's wise to have a plan before entering the gates. You can check out the schedule on the festival website, or download the festival's phone app, and then form your own daily itinerary in advance.___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "412"}
{"content": "July 27--NAPA -- Miller will be thrust into the spotlight, at least to begin camp, with Donald Penn on the physically unable to perform list. The 35-year-old incumbent starter at left tackle is still recovering from December foot surgery. Enter the rookie first-rounder who the Raiders took 15th overall. He posed a threat to Penn's job from the get-go, but now he really has a chance to strut his stuff as the primary protector on Derek Carr's blind side with his mentor sidelined.\"Kolton is awesome,\" Carr said. \"He's really tall ... Very athletic. Can move, can run. He's strong. You can tell that he put in a lot of work in the weight room before he came back. That's for any college kid, I don't care how strong you are, you can always get stronger. He put in all that work during that break.\"He came back and he's strong, ready to take those bull rushes. As a tall guy, you know that's coming. You know the bull rush is coming. But he's ready. He looks really good.\"Miller saw first-team reps at left tackle Friday during the Raiders' first full-squad training camp practice. Often, he opposed Bruce Irvin, now playing defensive end. Irvin made it his mission this season to finally reach double-digit sack totals for the first time in his career. He's unleashing that desire on the quiet rookie just getting his feet wet in a NFL training camp.\"He's blocking a beast over there,\" Raiders' head coach Jon Gruden said. \"Bruce Irvin is one of our captains right now and he's gonna test Miller every day.\"I think it can only help me,\" Miller said. \"He has a lot of tools that he uses, a lot of moves, which means you have to really hone on your craft. He wants you to mess up. That's something that you have to focus on and make sure you don't because then it can get you.\"Miller and his fellow rookies, along with a few non-rookies, have been in Napa since Monday. Until the remaining veterans arrived Thursday, Miller, Brandon Parker, second-year guard Cameron Hunt and second-year guard Jordan Simmons were the only offensive linemen around. Miller got reps calling out protections with limited numbers, which he says helped him for Friday's debut doing so with the full team on the field.Miller, who admitted Friday he's not much of a talker, even saw a different side of himself emerge during Day 1.\"I feel a lot more comfortable making calls,\" he said. \"I think today I was pretty vocal out there.\"Despite the possibility of losing his job to someone more than a decade younger, Penn has mentored Miller as he prepares for what could be a prominent role on Oakland's offensive line.\"Especially Donald Penn, that happened a lot in the spring,\" Miller said of which veterans he's turned to for advice. \"I'd be in the back and he'd tell me, 'You can be doing this and sitting back.' He has a lot of tips for me, especially him being as experienced as he is.\"Penn worked to the side with trainers on Friday, and his recovery from Lisfranc surgery doesn't seem like it'll sideline him too much longer.\"I think he's getting close. I talk to him every day,\" Gruden said. \"He's working independently with trainers right now but he's getting close. He still has to prove that he can change directions explosively and wake up the next day and do it again and again.\"Until then, it's Miller's time to shine. Penn could very well return in short order and snag his starting spot back. But with the veteran out, now is as good a time as any for Miller to show why he belongs.\"I feel really pleased with Kolton, not only from an athletic standpoint but from a mental standpoint,\" Gruden said. \"(Offensive line coach Tom) Cable is on him every day. He's learning how to play with Derek Carr, who's doing a lot at the line of scrimmage. He's showing a lot of poise and obviously he's very talented.\"He's just a pup getting started.\"___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "413"}
{"content": "Aug. 01--It's hard not to be impressed with Twins top pick Trevor Larnach's big night Tuesday night for Minnesota's rookie league team.Unless you're Trevor Larnach.The former College Park High of Pleasant Hill star, who was the 20th overall pick in last month's MLB draft, blasted his first two professional home runs for the Elizabethton (Tenn.) Twins of the Appalachian League. But he views his twin blasts in an 8-5 win over the Johnson City Cardinals in a more practical way than most 21-year-olds would.\"It felt good, for sure,\" Larnach told MiLB.com. \"But at the same time, I don't want to make too big of a deal out of it. It's cool to start your career with that first hit, first homer or first RBI, but I plan on playing this game for a long time. I don't want to sit and cherish one or two home runs when it's my job to do damage in as many at-bats as I can.\"Larnach's professional approach seems to be working thus far. Through 11 games and 40 at-bats with Elizabethton, Larnach is hitting .300 with 13 RBIs to go with a .412 on-base percentage and .500 slugging percentage.The hot start is just the latest chapter in Larnach's storied baseball career. Three years ago, Larnach was an All-State player helped College Park beat De La Salle for the North Coast Section Division I title.The success continued at Oregon State, where he was an All-Pac-12 outfielder whose career culminated with him playing a starring role in the Beavers' College World Series title in late June.Larnach hit one of the biggest home runs in College World Series history, crushing a two-run, game-winning home run in the ninth inning to snap a 3-3 Game 2 tie with Arkansas.

But it's the last month where Laureano has really started to turn it on, having hit .373 in the month of July with eight home runs, 18 RBIs and six stolen bases. He arrives to Oakland on an 11-game hit streak, with seven multi-hit performances over that stretch.It's been a nice bounce back for Laureano, who had to miss the first month of the season after breaking his left hand March 12 in a spring training game on a pitch from San Francisco Giants reliever Roberto Gomez.Laureano is considered an athletic outfielder with plus-speed and bat speed.Once an Astros prospect expected to patrol the Houston outfield alongside George Springer and Kyle Tucker for years to come, struggles at Double-A made Laureano an expendable piece. He was traded to the A's in November 2017 in exchange for minor league pitcher Brandon Bailey.___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "415"}
{"content": "July 30--Kyle Hendricks overcame his first-inning blues, and the Cubs took advantage of a two-out error by second baseman Yairo Munoz to score three times in the top of the fifth inning to earn a 5-2 win over the Cardinals and snap a two-game losing streak.The start of Sunday night's game was delayed 76 minutes by rain.Hendricks allowed a two-run home run to Marcell Ozuna as his first-inning ERA swelled to 8.59. But after allowing a double to Munoz with one out in the second, Hendricks retired 17 consecutive batters.\"I was being more aggressive and getting quicker outs,\" said Hendricks, who tied his season high by striking out eight in a 107-pitch outing over seven innings. \"I still got into some deep counts. (But) the mindset was better and saw the results.\"Hendricks credited catcher Willson Contreras by \"not being predictable\" in pitch selection and calling for his curve. \"So all that blended into not having to make perfect pitches,\" Hendricks said.Hendricks stopped a trend in which Cubs starters hadn't pitched at least six innings in three consecutive starts.\"I'm hoping Jon (Lester) can give us some momentum (on Tuesday at Pittsburgh),\" Hendricks said. \"(Cole) Hamels will bring a lot of energy, just seeing something new. I think he's going to lift all of us a little bit.\"We can all learn from him. Hopefully this is the time we can start rattling off some good starts.\"Ben Zobrist gave the Cubs a 1-0 lead with a home run that landed in the Cardinals bullpen in right field. Zobrist went 4-for-5.Anthony Rizzo tied the game on a leadoff homer in the fourth that landed on the berm in center field.In the fifth, Munoz bobbled a slow roller by Jason Heyward that allowed Rizzo to score the go-ahead run, and Javier Baez followed with a two-run double down the left field line.Rookie David Bote made two exceptional plays at third, including a bare-handed stop and throw to retire Jedd Gyorko to start the fourth.\"That's as good of a play as a third baseman is going to make,\" Maddon said.Bote said he works on his defense, even during rain delays.\"My thing at third is get everything I can unless (shortstop Addison Russell) calls me off,\" Bote said. \"I didn't hear anything, so I went full speed and got it.\"mgonzales@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "416"}
{"content": "July 31--SANTA CLARA -- \"He's got size, he's got power and he's been playing real well,\" coach Kyle Shanahan said Tuesday of Taylor. \"So, we were going to do that anyway: give him a chance, because he's earned it by some of the reps he's doing. It made it easy with what happened to Arik.\"Armstead's prognosis is \"week to week.\" He ended the last two seasons on injured reserve (torn shoulder labrum, fractured hand) and missed 18 of the past 24 games. Three months ago, the 49ers picked up his fifth-year option for 2019 at over $9 million.Taylor's insertion to the first-string defense at the \"big end\" spot was a bit surprising -- he leapfrogged Ronald Blair -- and he handled himself well. \"I was, of course, nervous, but it was more of an honor to do that for the organization,\" Taylor said. \"I think I did pretty well, with some rookie mistakes.\"The 49ers drafted Taylor in the seventh round (No. 223 overall) out of Temple, where he played only one full season (20 games in five years). He only played one year of high school ball in New Jersey. \"I did what I had to do my senior year and I'm grateful for the 49ers drafting me to show my potential to the world,\" said Taylor, noting that veteran Earl Mitchell is helping him immensely with technique.A year ago, the 49ers used a seventh-round pick on another prospect with a limited college film: Adrian Colbert, who opened his rookie camp as a cornerback before evolving into the starting free safety by year's end.Is Taylor this year's Colbert-type success story? \"I didn't come in and say I'm going to be the next Adrian Colbert, but big-ups to him for getting a starting spot,\" Taylor answered. \"I'm here to just pave my own way.\"Here are nine other items from Niners camp:1. Dominant pass rush?: Taylor's first-string debut was enhanced by DeForest Buckner's dominance in only his third camp. Also, pass rushers Jeremiah Attaochu and Cassius Marsh are showing their speed, and 2017 top pick Solomon Thomas has had strong bursts into the backfield.Shanahan confirmed the pass rush has excelled the past two practices after a sluggish debut Saturday. As for Buckner's improvement, he added: \"He's taken huge steps forward this year, watching how he moves and his different pass rushes with different tools to use. He has what he was born with: size and power, and that's where it starts.\" Buckner could emerge as the 49ers' best edge rusher, even though his base-defense spot is on the interior.2. Bucs model: Thomas said the 49ers defensive front is \"as close as it's ever been, as high as it's ever been,\" and their camaraderie is something they're trying to mimic from the 2002 Tampa Bay Buccaneers' Super Bowl-winning defense that included John Lynch. \"It's more of seeing how they rush together and how their chemistry was perfect,\" said Thomas, who played hurt Tuesday after someone stepped on his left foot.3. Garoppolo picked: It took 58 passes for Jimmy Garoppolo to have a pass intercepted in team drills this camp, and that theft came Tuesday when Adrian Colbert nabbed a pass over the middle intended for Marquise Goodwin and returned it for a would-be, 75-yard touchdown.Shanahan said the 49ers tinkered with that play-action rep by moving Pierre Garcon into a different spot. \"The one time we did it, Colbert didn't back up, made a great key,\" Shanahan said. \"He was flat-footed because of the run fake -- then shot his guns, made the catch and got a pick-six, so it was a helluva play by him.\"Garoppolo, pressured repeatedly Tuesday, still went 14-of-17 and is now 41-of-58 in full-team drills. He fared best in a red-zone drill when targeting running backs Jerick McKinnon and Matt Breida.4. Sherman revisited: Beat by Marquise Goodwin to open Sunday's drills, Richard Sherman bounced back Tuesday with an interception covering Pierre Garcon in one-on-ones. As for Sunday's video, Shanahan replayed it to the team as a lesson, without disparaging Sherman's effort.\"He used that as a coaching point,\" fullback Kyle Juszczyk said. \"He didn't get up there and bash on Sherman, like 'We paid you this much and you give us that?' It was nothing like that. He actually complimented him, because it was his very first rep in one-on-ones since he was injured, he was aggressive and didn't hesitate. I tried to take that into my one-on-ones and be aggressive.\"5. Foster dinged: Linebacker Reuben Foster, who battled an assortment of injuries last year as a rookie, dinged his right quadriceps early in Tuesday's session but practiced through the pain. He got hurt when colliding on a spin move with Juszczyk in a pass-protection drill. \"With Charley horses and stuff, guys get banged in their quads a lot. Nothing too concerning,\" Shanahan said.6. Health watch: Wide receiver Trent Taylor (back), guard Jonathan Cooper (knee), safety Marcell Harris (Achilles) and linebackers Malcolm Smith (heel) and Dekoda Watson (calf) came off injury lists and participated in position drills but no full-team action. Also out for team drills, after tightening up in warmups, were defensive back Jimmie Ward and linebacker Brock Coyle.7. Guard competition: Joshua Garnett (knee) missed his second straight practice and is \"day to day.\" With Cooper yet to enter team drills, Mike Person remained the starter at right guard, and J.P. Flynn was his backup.Could Person seize the starting job the way Brandon Fusco did a year ago as an unheralded signing? Person played under Shanahan with the Atlanta Falcons in 2015. \"He's familiar with the system, was versatile and was best of the (May tryouts),\" Shanahan said.8. Tight end move: Cole Hikutini's impressive camp is on hold after a groin injury, which will keep him out this week. The 49ers thus signed tight end Wes Saxton, who produced a touchdown catch in red-zone drills.9. Juszczyk on RBs: Juszczyk figures to be lead blocking a lot for McKinnon, who he helped recruit in free agency. Juszczyk has \"a soft spot for a multi-faceted guy\" and says McKinnon sets up blocks well. As for backup Breida, Juszczyk raved about how he's become more decisive and better balanced as a rusher.___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "417"}
{"content": "Sure, Mars colonization is possible with us living in indoors in giant domes, but the whole thing would certainly be easier if the planet\u2019s atmosphere was somehow made more like Earth\u2019s. One way to achieve this would be to utilize the carbon dioxide already trapped in the Martian surface to thicken the atmosphere up to the point at which Mars is warm enough to keep water in the liquid form we know and love. Simple, right?\u201cIn changing the Martian climate to one that is more Earth-like, we would want to increase the atmospheric pressure, so that we could walk around without spacesuits, and the temperature, so that ice would melt and we wouldn\u2019t need to use heaters as much,\u201d Bruce Jakosky, a professor in the Geological Sciences department at the University of Colorado, Boulder, told Digital Trends. \u201cTo do this, we need to add a greenhouse gas to the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is the best available greenhouse gas \u2014 it\u2019s very effective, and it should be abundant on Mars.\u201dSadly, science is here to act as Debbie Downer, since a new research paper from Jakosky and Northern Arizona University\u2019s Christopher Edwards suggests that there\u2019s simply not enough carbon dioxide to go around.\u201cThe short answer is that much of the CO2 has been lost to space,\u201d Jakosky continued. \u201cThat which remains behind is not enough to raise either the pressure or the temperature enough to be useful. Furthermore, it\u2019s very difficult to mobilize the CO2. In practice, it\u2019s not possible to use CO2 on Mars to terraform the planet, and terraforming cannot be done with present-day technology.\u201dEven if it was possible to melt the polar ice caps on Mars using thermonuclear explosions (a theory put forward by SpaceX CEO and would-be Mars \u00e9migr\u00e9 Elon Musk), the amount of CO2 released would only be enough to bring Mars\u2019 atmospheric pressure to a measly 1.2 percent of Earth\u2019s. Even for the most ambitious of Martian settlers, that\u2019s pretty tough to live on!Don\u2019t give up hope, though. Just because this method wouldn\u2019t work doesn\u2019t mean that terraforming is out of the question altogether. \u201cIt would still be possible to terraform Mars by, for example, manufacturing high-efficiency greenhouse gases such as CFCs that could raise the temperature,\u201d Jakosky said. \u201cBut that would require large-scale manufacturing processes that clearly are beyond our present capability.\u201dIn other words, things may look hopeless to us now, but there\u2019s still hope for the Mars enthusiasts of 2118.

{"content": "Knoll Inc. (KNL) stock jumped on Tuesday, July 31, after the company that designs and manufactures furnishings and textiles for the workplace and residential homes reported earnings and revenue that topped Wall Street's estimates, driven largely by the office segment. Knoll posted reported adjusted earnings of 42 cents per share on revenue of $323.4 million, which surpassed expectations of earnings of 38 cents per share on revenue of $307.7 million, according to FactSet. The growth this quarter is a result of two factors, according to Chief Executive Officer Andrew Cogan. \"First, organically, the core office business has been very strong, I think stronger than people expected,\" Cogan told TheStreet. \"What's happening in the office place -- you've got corporate profitability, service sector employment -- all those are positive backdrops to increasing office furniture demand.\" \"Number two, companies are changing the way they are working -- less space for individuals, more space for group and collaborative -- and [research and development] efforts and our acquisition efforts have really been focused on what we call that ancillary part of the office -- the group areas -- and we've really strengthened our offerings.\" The East Greenville, Penn.-based company makes 60% of its revenue from the office segment, which earned $190.7 million for the second quarter. While collaborative workspaces are on the rise, individual workspaces are becoming more high performing, said Cogan. \"Our fastest-growing category is sit-stand desks and height adjustability, so while you're getting less space, you're getting a more high performing space, and that aligns well with Knoll's capability, which is high design differentiated products.\" The company also saw an acceleration with its residential homes unit called Lifestyle, and Cogan is not at all worried about a slowing housing market. \"We actually play more in the upper end of the residential market, and in that segment we're seeing strong demographics,\" said Cogan. \"The consumer there is doing well -- tax cuts, stock market, wealth creation -- that tends to drive our consumer in the upper end of the market.\" Furthermore, Cogan said tariffs won't significantly affect the business but noted that Knoll expects about $10 million to $12 million of incremental costs this year, which the company plans to offset through price increases. \"The bulk of our products are manufactured in North America and Europe, so while we do bring components in from China and we would be impacted by a threatened tariff, it's a few million dollars for us, it's not a significant number,\" Cogan said.

{"content": "July 30--SANTA CLARA -- Gage Teran McCartney, 25, of Sunnyvale, appeared in a San Jose courtroom where he answered to a single murder count in the July 20 death of 54-year-old Campbell resident , whose body was found that morning in Central Park in Santa Clara.McCartney did not enter a plea and was sent back to the Santa Clara County jail where he is being held without bail. He is scheduled to next appear in court Sept. 25.A group of people who attended the brief court hearing Monday in support of McCartney declined to speak to a reporter. Similarly, friends and family of Hyde declined comment.Hyde, a married father of three who was a longtime member of the Cathedral of Faith church in San Jose, was a popular butcher at the Safeway on Homestead Road about a block from the park where he died. McCartney worked at the same grocer, also as a butcher.\"Mr. Hyde was beloved in his community,\" Deputy District Attorney Alaleh Kianerci said after the arraignment. \"Everyone was shocked by the way he was so brutally and violently murdered. Our goal is to bring justice to his family.\"According to Santa Clara police, McCartney and Hyde had finished a shift at the Safeway the night of July 19, then ate dinner together at a local McDonald's. Around 11 p.m., they returned to the supermarket to purchase a bottle of liquor, and were seen in surveillance footage \"dancing in the video and appeared to be in good spirits and intoxicated.\"Court documents show that McCartney told detectives that the two then walked to Central Park, and that Hyde made several sexual advances toward him and that he punched and choked Hyde to keep him away. McCartney reportedly told police that at one point he \"put his hands on each side of the victim's neck and squeezed, causing him to fall to the ground,\" but that he walked away believing Hyde was merely unconscious.Hyde was found lying on the ground the next morning. He was pronounced dead at the scene.When he was interviewed by detectives, McCartney told them \"he was shocked about what happened and was furious with the victim for making sexual advances toward him,\" and that \"his instinct took over.\"McCartney declined a jailhouse interview with this news organization.McCartney's defense, if centered on his police account, could be curtailed due to a state law signed in 2014 that formally banned so-called \"gay panic\" or \"trans panic,\" defenses from being used to lessen the severity of criminal charges. California, Rhode Island, and Illinois are the only states to have such a restriction, though the the American Bar Association has condemned the practice and Congressional legislation has been proposed for a federal ban.The California ban was inspired by cases like the fatal 1998 beating of Matthew Shepard in Wyoming and the 2002 murder of Gwen Araujo in Newark, by attackers who presented gay and trans panic defenses at their trials. The National LGBT Bar Association said such defenses, while rare, are still being used effectively, most recently in a 2015 stabbing death in Austin that was adjudicated in April and resulted in the defendant avoiding prison time after a murder charge was downgraded to criminally negligent homicide.\"The goal of these laws is that you don't get to use the identity, perceived or actual, of the victim to say, 'Hey, they brought it on themselves,' \" said D'Arcy Kemnitz, executive director of the LGBT Bar. \"We're in the darkest ages when you can say, a gay guy made a pass at me, so I killedhim and I shouldn't be held accountable. We don't want to live in world where that happens.\"A former roommate of McCartney's told this newspaper that physical violence was not an unusual occurrence with the defendant. Joseph Toman said McCartney was prone to unpredictable outbursts and distorting conflicts to evade responsibility.\"I don't like him making the victim seem like he was attacking him. Gage always tries to play the victim, always tries to flip things,\" Toman said. \"I want the full story out there.\"___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "420"}

On the other hand, skin that is riddled with trying to get rid of acne, whiteheads, and scars. Often times, these may actually indicate that we lack proper nutrition, good hygiene habits, and hormonal balance.The American Academy of Dermatology states that acne is the most common skin problem in the United States, with over 17 million people suffering from this inconvenient and embarrassing skin malady.     While it may be considered a common skin condition, many of us simply do not know how to get rid of acne. If left untreated, it can cause hyperpigmentation and scarring on the face, neck, chest, back, and arms, causing emotional distress right along with physical discomfort. Breakouts, stress, and poor self-esteem set up a vicious cycle that is difficult to break. We rush into our dermatologist for the latest innovation in skincare, a nutritional consultation, even prescription medication, and little do we realize that the answer to our clear skin needs may be right at home in our own cupboards.The following home remedies have been proven to be remarkably effective at diminishing existing outbreaks of acne and preventing new ones from occurring.      Say goodbye to the outbreaks of the past as we learn how to get rid of acne naturally.GarlicNot only will vampires steer clear, pimples will disappear in the presence of this magic substance.

It can be applied directly to the skin, reducing inflammation and promoting the rejuvenation of fresh healthy cells, or it can be taken internally as a dietary supplement. Aloe vera contains a natural form of salicylic acid, a known treatment for effectively eradicating acne. When applied to the skin, it has a cooling, soothing effect that leaves behind a fresher, softer, more supple complexion.     HoneyHoney is nature\u2019s most potent antibiotic. Acne forms as a result of bacteria in the skin becoming inflamed and irritated, causing redness, rash, and pimples to appear. You can apply honey directly to the skin for a quick and easy face mask that strips the skin of all impurities without stripping it of its natural moisture balance. Simply rinse affected areas off after an application of honey has been allowed to sit for 15-20 minutes, and you have a beautiful canvas to work with once more.Tea Tree OilThis is the Cadillac of home skin treatments. Tea tree oil has long been praised for its ability to cleanse and tone even the most problem-prone skin. While tea tree oil is not recommended for internal consumption, it can be applied topically for best results without any health complications or consequences that arise from treatment. A fresh, clear complexion awaits you after only a few applications.One of the main causes of acne is the buildup of excess oil on and underneath the top layer of skin. The application of a baking soda and water paste to the skin as a natural mask will draw out impurities, restore the delicate Ph balance of the skin, and allow it to retain its natural moisture. Apply a few times a week for best results.Apple Cider VinegarYou may not \u201crelish\u201d the thought of smelling like a pickle, but your skin will thank you.

Scarlett Johansen knows how to get rid of acne; she has suffered from it for years. A simple application of apple cider vinegar toner is partially responsible for the beautiful woman we now see in film and in print.Salt And Olive OilGetting that top layer of dead skin off our face so dead skin cells don\u2019t have the opportunity to clog pores is essential for healthy, clear skin. A mixture of olive oil and salt will produce an effective, moisturizing scrub that will remove that pesky outer layer and leave fresh, healthy skin behind. Mix 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil with salt, apply to skin using a gentle circular motion and allow to dry.

Teams used to rarely unload players but the arrival of a new generation of GMs has changed that.The 2018 offseason was unprecedented in its number of deals, both big and small.

The question is whether the big movements are done or are they just beginning?There are still plenty of names that could be in play for the trade deadline this fall. Names either still holding out from their respective teams or names that will be free agents in 2019 barring a last-second move. Here are some to watch and the likely teams they\u2019d fit best on if they were to get dealt.Teddy Bridgewater (QB)Sam Darnold finally signed his rookie contract, so the original plan seems back in place. The New York Jets may not hand him the torch immediately but it\u2019s almost inevitable at this point. Many feel they might try to play Teddy Bridgewater for a few games as sort of an audition to elevate his stock and then deal him before the trade deadline before moving to Darnold. Not a bad plan as Bridgewater is fully healthy now and respected around the league for his leadership traits.Destination: Tampa Bay BuccaneersIt\u2019s felt for quite some time that the Buccaneers are almost out of patience with Jameis Winston. The former #1 pick has been a headache off the field lately with his sexual assault allegations. His play on the field has elevated as high as they\u2019d hoped either.

{"content": "CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA \u2013 MARCH 3: Bartley of the Virginia Cavaliers and the rest of the bench cheers. (Photo by Ryan M. Kelly/Getty Images)Virginia basketball returns a ton of talent after winning the ACC regular-season title last season. Can they repeat in the nation\u2019s toughest conference?There are very few programs as consistent as Virginia basketball. Under the guidance of head coach Tony Bennett, the Cavaliers have clearly emerged as one of the best programs in the nation. UVA is an elite defensive team year in and year out and that often puts them near the top of the ACC standings. Considering how deep and competitive the ACC is every season, this consistency is not something that anyone should simply gloss over.Virginia has won at least 11 (out of 18) conference games in each of the past six seasons and has won 16 or more of those contests in two campaigns as well. While many other teams (*cough* Duke and North Carolina *cough*) seemingly consistently receive more national praise and attention, the Cavaliers have been arguably the best regular-season ACC team over the past several years. Of course, the struggles in the NCAA Tournament certainly do not help matters but that does not tell the whole tale of a team\u2019s season.In fact, as great as the Big Dance is for spectators, it is still a single-elimination event that can result in top teams going down early. To the dismay of Virginia fans everywhere, it just so happens that they have been that top team going down early more often than not. In the last five years, the Cavaliers have bowed out of the NCAA Tournament on the opening weekend on three different occasions, including the disastrous 16-over-1 upset this past season.Nonetheless, Virginia has had some success in the Big Dance (Elite Eight in 2015-16) and is clearly a force to be reckoned with in the regular season. Heading into the 2018-19 campaign, there is no reason to believe that this team will be back with a vengeance. The Cavaliers should still be an elite team in the ACC and here are five reasons why they might be able to compete for the regular-season title.", "id": "423"}
{"content": "A year ago, Edouardo Jordan was a locally renowned Seattle chef and owner of two restaurants: Salare, a restaurant specializing in French and Italian cuisine, and the three-month-old JuneBaby, a more deeply personal project featuring food anchored in the black southern experience. The Florida native knew his new restaurant was special, but even he couldn\u2019t have predicted what would unfold next, including appearances on several national Best New Restaurants lists, two James Beard awards (Best Chef: Northwest and Best New Restaurant), and a three-star review from Times critic Pete Wells, the first such review for a black chef in 20 years.         Grub caught up with the Jordan \u2014 who is in New York \u2014 to discuss his newfound fame, the continued lack of diversity in food media, and that life-changing Times review that seemingly came out of nowhere.         It\u2019s been a very big year for you. JuneBaby was been named Best New Restaurant by Esquire, Food &amp; Wine, and Eater. You won two James Beard awards, including Best New Restaurant. It\u2019s just wild. Nothing\u2019s changed. Same ol\u2019 thing. Just running. Nothing has changed besides the speed of the run.         Everything really culminated with the James Beard awards, which took place just after JuneBaby\u2019s one-year anniversary. How did you feel in that moment? When my name was announced first for the regional, the first thing I thought was, \u2018Holy shit, I just won!\u2019 Then I was like, \u2018Holy shit, we\u2019re gonna probably win two!\u2019 I felt really good about JuneBaby, but my chances were fifty-fifty for the regional award because we\u2019ve got a lot of talented chefs here doing a lot of talented things. At the same time, I was freakin\u2019 bust my butt and I\u2019m glad I got recognized.                                           Since then, everyone seems to want a piece of you. They always wanted a piece. I just never gave them anything. But yeah, there\u2019s some cooler, exciting things that have come around, like offers and events and things. It\u2019s a blessing. Also a curse because it keeps me extremely busy.                          You\u2019re doing a pop-up dinner at Olmsted. And you\u2019re bringing your son along, right?Yeah, he\u2019s coming with me to New York. It\u2019s summertime so it allows me to get him out. I want to be a good father to him. I want him to see the world that I didn\u2019t get to see. My food allows me to see things that I would have never seen before in my life, so I need to share that with my little offshoot. He\u2019s my right-hand man. He\u2019s my boss. This trip is more about him than it is about me.         I was excited to talk to you again because a few months ago Grub asked \u201cWhere are the black restaurant critics?\u201d and your success at the James Beard awards played a big part. Is the lack of representation in food media something you care about or are you just trying to focus on your mission? I care about all of that. I care about doing my thing because I decided to open up my own business, and business comes first, beyond ethical and moral things that happen along the way. Ideally, I need to protect and take care of myself and my investors and my investment. But I do care about the fact that we don\u2019t have many people of color that are actually out there and have opinions beyond a blog or their own personal website about the foods that have shaped America.                          It does resonate with me how broken our critic system is as well. We can\u2019t say the culinary world is great yet. We had one stellar year and that was just the James Beard awards. That doesn\u2019t mean next year\u2019s going to be great. Let\u2019s look at some of the other magazines and other publications that do the top ten every year. We might be surprised. We\u2019re still at 0.003 percent. James Beard did do their part this year. Great. Hopefully, they can do it next year or follow suit in some way. Hopefully, they\u2019re purposely taking the time to get out there and explore and discover. Who\u2019s going to give a real opinion of some of the foods that black people grew up on or even just knew? I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s a different opinion from a different perspective of what food is and what food should be.                          You said last year that for a long time you avoided opening a restaurant like JuneBaby because you didn\u2019t want to get pigeonholed as a soul-food chef. How do you feel about the fact that JuneBaby still earned you more attention and recognition than the French and Italian food at Salare?I mean, Salare was in probably 70 percent of the publications that JuneBaby was in. I think just the importance of JuneBaby allowed it to have a bigger voice. Salare can get mixed up with any other restaurant that was opened during that same period. There are plenty of French restaurants, there are plenty of Italian restaurants, there are plenty of European restaurants out there. But there weren\u2019t any southern restaurants opening at the same caliber, the same chef, and the same mind-set as JuneBaby. So, it\u2019s hard to compare that to anything.", "id": "424"}

{"content": "Granit Xhaka holds a unique skillset not always akin to his defensive midfield position, how Unai Emery therefore structures a midfield to accommodate his strengths and hide his weaknesses will be key to Arsenal\u2019s success this season.As things stand, Granit Xhaka will go down as one of the most divisive Arsenal players of his generation. It is rare to find a player who is so highly rated by some sections of a support base and so disregarded by others. His core strength is in controlling the pace of a game from deep, utilising an exceptional passing range that affords him the luxury of either short passes to retain possession or longer passes to spring counter attacks and a more direct style of attack. In the past players deployed as a \u2018pivot\u2019 were nearly always constructed with a skillset that prioritised excellent defensive positioning, proficiency in the tackle and general ball recovery expertise.Whilst Xhaka possesses the requisite aggression and reading of the game, he lacks the aforementioned basics of a true holding midfielder. The catch-22 is deploying him higher up, in a box-to-box or attacking capacity, diminishes his value as he struggles with the reduced space and time, most notably the requirement of quick feet. The only option is for him to be deployed from deep.In Lucas Torreira, Arsenal have signed the required complimentary skillset for Xhaka. Torreira is expert at ball retrieval and when combined with a defensive mind-set is perfect to offset Xhaka\u2019s weaknesses and provide much needed balance. He even adds the energy and pressing ability which are two further accusations around Xhaka\u2019s competency. On the face of it, deploying these two together, in deep-lying positions, as part of a 4-2-3-1 appears a well-rounded and well-constructed setup.However, this suggests that Aaron Ramsey would be deployed in a No. 10 role with Ozil and Mkhitaryan flanking him and Arsenal\u2019s full backs providing width. The issue with Ramsey in such a role, as we saw in the 2013-2014 season, is that it does not lend itself to his strengths. When you consider Ramsey is about energy and running box-to-box combined with an uncanny knack of arriving late to take advantage of scoring opportunities, a number 10 role will not act as the catalyst for a high level of performance, you would never for example consider employing Frank Lampard in this type of role.The most likely outcome is that Arsenal will deploy a 4-3-3 with Xhaka as the pivot, Ramsey in his ideal box-to-box role and Torreira in a symmetrical role with licence to hunt the ball higher up rather than waiting to intercept from deeper positions. He certainly has the aggression and energy to perform such a role whilst he has the perfect role model in N\u2019Golo Kante who has performed a higher and more proactive role previously, despite admittedly playing in an out-an-out holding role during the most recent World Cup. The structure of Xhaka, Torreira and Ramsey provides combativeness, energy and athleticism with a reliance on Xhaka to dictate the game from deep, it will however add pressure on Ozil and Mkhitarian as the sole creative forces from wide. Given this, one suspects we might require more creativity centrally throughout the season and in which case one of the trio will need be sacrificed.Despite a lack of creativity within such a midfield structure, the obvious imbalance between defence and attack has been addressed with the signing of Torreira, and will introduce a defensive efficiency that will not only elevate pressure but also offer more control over games. Our new look midfield, in conclusion, is a step in the right direction however not without questions that will need answering.", "id": "426"}
{"content": "July 26--LAS VEGAS -- Because even while playing down his latest riff, this time with CJ McCollum of the Portland Trail Blazers, the Warriors star made it clear he will fiercely defend his reputation.\"I say something back and I'm the sensitive one?\" Durant said after a spirited Team USA practice at UNLV. \"I mean, I know you're all trying to make me look crazy and strip me of my credibility. I see what you're doing. But I'm going to keep standing.\"Durant and McCollum mixed it up on Twitter on Wednesday, with McCollum questioning Durant's decision to leave the Oklahoma City Thunder to sign with the Warriors in 2016. The Blazers guard called it \"soft\" and compared it to switching sides in a fight. He'd already told Durant that personally when he was a guest on the \"Pull Up with CJ McCollum\" podcast.Durant fired back on Twitter with: \"U think that low of me CJ? I just did your (expletive) podcast. Snakes in the grass boy, I tell ya.\" He capped off that exchange with a laughing emoji.At his informal press gathering Thursday, things began on a lighthearted note. The question referenced \"the incident yesterday with CJ.\"\"CJ who?\" Durant replied. \"Oh, McCollum. What happened yesterday?\"Thus began something of an Abbott &amp; Costello routine, with the reporter dancing around the subject while Durant let him squirm.Reporter: Is that all in fun?Durant: What did you think it was?Reporter: It seemed a little more serious.Durant: Why?Reporter: Just because it seemed like you were serious.Durant: Why me?Reporter: Because of what he had said.Durant: So why isn't he upset?Reporter: He doesn't seem to be upset.Durant: So why am I upset then?This went on for quite some time. Finally, the nine-time All-Star vented some frustration over a repeated pattern. The way Durant sees it, everybody else can take potshots at will. But if Durant pipes up? It's a media sensation, with him in the villain's role.\"I go about my business,\" the NBA Finals MVP said, \"but every time I say something, House of Highlights and Bleacher Report run with it. ... Everybody runs with it.\"Now people come to me and say, 'Damn, man. I didn't know you were so cool' when they meet me in person. Why? Because of what y'all say. And that goes for everybody around here. ... I just talk. I say how I feel. But I guess I'm the bad guy.\"McCollum is on the Team USA roster but was among a handful of players who did not participate in the 2-hour practice Thursday. Many of Durant's Warriors teammates also chose to miss this two-day camp, for various reasons. Stephen Curry earlier this month announced that he would spend this time with his family, including his newborn son.Klay Thompson and Draymond Green, meanwhile, made the late decision to not participate. They are among the 35 roster hopefuls to represent USA in the FIBA World Cup (in China, in 2019) and the 2020 Summer Olympics (in Tokyo).Gregg Popovich took over the coaching reins this season, and will stay in charge through 2020. His assistant coaching staff here includes Mike Brown of the Warriors.Durant, who has previous Team USA experience, said it's been a smooth transition from Mike Krzyzewski to Popovich.\"It feels like the same atmosphere, the same energy here,\" he said. \"The little details might change. But I think they preach the same thing in terms of togetherness and unity and doing this as a group for something bigger than ourselves.\"___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "427"}

Dawg Pound Daily\u2019s own Randy Gurzi has mocked yet another freak athlete to Cleveland, creating an embarrassment of riches on the front line of defense.Randy Gurzi of both Dawg Pound Daily and NFL SpinZone has been feverishly slaving away on his 2019 mock draft. As training camp starts up, he has decided to slot Houston defensive tackle Ed Oliver to the Cleveland Browns with the No. 3 selection.To those of you who have not yet heard the name Ed Oliver, you\u2019ll get to know him very well this fall. A freakish talent from the University of Houston, Oliver has already declared for the 2019 NFL Draft. Such ammunition on the defensive line could make for quarterback nightmares all across the league.The only real problem with this pick is that it\u2019s a bit unrealistic. Hopes are high in Cleveland and with training camp now underway, it\u2019s easy to see just why hope is springing eternal in the Dawg Pound. And yet, Oliver is still projected to be a top-three pick, maybe even No. 1 overall.For the Browns to move up that far, they might have to sell off at least one of their premier talents. It might be worth it, depending on just what they give up. Oliver is basically already an NFL-level talent, and he would complete perhaps the best defensive line in the entire league.Being considered the best in the NFL at anything is a huge accomplishment. As a group, this is an even more impressive feat. In a division like the AFC North, the Browns need all the hard-nosed defensive help they can get, and having the best defensive line in football certainly counts for something.A healthy group of Myles Garrett, Emmanuel Ogbah, Larry Ogunjobi, and Ed Oliver could terrorize the NFL for years to come. It could be a hefty price to pay, but if the Browns brass deems it worth it, they could be willing to give up a lot for Houston\u2019s freakish athlete.Everyone has a price, and maybe Ed Oliver could be 2019\u2019s catalyst to major playoff moves in Cleveland.", "id": "428"}

Sometimes it is made from lamb and bear, as well as from chicken. Of course, everyone likes juicy and fragrant meat.We share the main secrets of cooking this delicious dishSecret number 1: the perfect meatIdeal meat for boiled pork is considered a whole piece of pork weighing from 1 to 3 kilograms. Meat for cooking choose with no bones, streaks and a little bit of fat. It can be a neck, ham or back. The main thing is that it is not frozen or paired. It affects the taste and juiciness.Secret number 2: fragrance\u00a0An important nuance in the preparation of boiled pork, which affects the final result, is the preparatory stage. Meat is rubbed, seasoned with spices and spices, soaked, marinated. There are a lot of cooking options for this dish. The main thing is to give him some time to brew, to soak up smells.Secret number 3: what to bake\u00a0There are several assistants who significantly influence the taste and aroma of the dish, and also speed up the process itself.\u00a0Modern housewives no longer represent cooking dishes without sleeves for baking. In it, the juice stays inside, and the boiled pork is especially tender.\u00a0Also, meat can be wrapped in foil, in several layers, then it will preserve juiciness. It is important that the mirror side of the foil is on top.\u00a0If you do not plan to use foil and sleeve, then periodically the meat needs to be watered with liquid. Water should also be poured in a thin layer (1 cm) in a pan for baking. In this case, the meat is better to put a fat piece up.Secret number 4: golden crust\u00a0To prevent the meat from getting dry, it should be placed in a well-heated oven. For a golden crust, before baking, you can fry the meat from two sides in a frying pan. Enough for 1-2 minutes for each side.Many an hour after baking they get meat, cover it with sauce from sour cream and ground red pepper, and then continue to bake.And one more little secret\u00a0After baking, simmer the boiled pork with a small load and allow the meat to cool.

{"content": "Has the Tesla bubble popped? According to a note from Goldman Sachs, Tesla Inc. (TSLA) customers are not as excited about the Model 3 as they used to be.  Goldman Sachs looked at posts about the Model 3 on Twitter and Reddit. Analysts found that weekly posts about the Model 3 declined. According to the note, there were around 4,400 posts a week in 2016, more than 3,900 posts per week in 2017 and year-to-date around 3,000 posts per week in 2018. The note also shows that positive skew is fading. Year-to-date \"2018 tracking at a 4.5% positive skew.\" This number is down from 12% positive skew in 2017. Another issue that Goldman Sachs points out is the conversion ratio for Model 3 reservation holders. \"Investors question how many of the 420,000 reservation holders will convert at [Model 3's] higher price points (given the vehicle was originally offered with a base price of 35,000),\" said the note. Goldman has Tesla at sell and has a price target of $195. Tesla currently trades around $295. The note comes after Tesla and Elon Musk, CEO, have been in hot water the past couple of weeks.  TheStreet's Annie Gaus reported on Tesla asking suppliers for refunds. Tesla asked for refunds on purchase agreements made as far back as 2016, as reported by the Wall Street Journal and confirmed in a tweet by Elon Musk and by the company on Monday, July 23. As Tesla struggles to fulfill promises that it will turn a profit by the end of this year, industry analysts are calling the refund requests an unusual move. And that's putting it mildly. And Elon Musk has reportedly been going after critics. According to the widely circulated account, Musk personally contacted the boss of the [Seeking Alpha] blogger - who wrote in his free time under a pseudonym - and threatened to sue or complain publicly about the posts. Elon Musk's Twitter account has more than 22 million followers, many of whom aggressively leap to his defense when he or the company is criticized.

And for the Washington Redskins, that will make for an interesting training camp.Going into training camp with a lot of position battles is never a good thing. Generally speaking, you want there to be a fairly solid set of established starters across your roster. If players are jockeying for depth, then so be it. But if you have questions at a critical position like quarterback, training camp can get ugly fast.This year, the Redskins appear to be in good shape. They have added a lot of talent to compete for depth positions, but most of their starters appear to be settled. Their front-seven, receiving corps, and quarterback situation look to be set pretty much in stone. So, that will give Jay Gruden and company time to look at all the other options on the squad.There are still some key position battles to be decided. Some of them are blatantly obvious, but others are a bit more hidden. Here are the top three position battles to watch during Redskins training camp.", "id": "431"}

Both backups to Trubisky have experience playing in this offense and both can provide insight to Trubisky. Whether head coach Matt Nagy activates three quarterbacks on game days remains to be seen.Howard and Cohen may be the best running back duo in the NFL. Behind them, there is a lot of competition. Both Mizzell and Cunningham have special teams experience. However, Mizzell has the speed and agility to be very valuable like Cohen in Nagy\u2019s offense. Meanwhile Cunningham, serves as more of a Jordan Howard type of back.Burton is one of the worst fullbacks I have ever seen. At times, he appears to shy away from contact, which defeats the entire purpose of the position. I would like to see Nall, who is almost 240 pounds, be the fullback. He could give you some emergency production at running back, while playing full back on occasion. Is Nall willing to make contact at the fullback position? I have no idea, but what I do know is that he\u2019s an undrafted guy that plays with heart. I\u2019d think he\u2019d do whatever he could to help the team.", "id": "432"}
{"content": "All-Pro left guard Kelechi Osemele has spent most of two seasons with the Raiders playing alongside a grizzled left tackle in Donald Penn who\u2019s entering his 13th NFL season. So far this camp, Osemele has lined up next to a player preparing for his first in first-round draft pick Kolton Miller. Osemele, in turn, is still learning Miller, but said after the team\u2019s second full practice Saturday his early impressions of the 6-foot-8 rookie have been favorable.  \u201cKolton looks real good right now,\u201d Osemele said. \u201cWe\u2019ve still got a lot of work to do. It\u2019s our first time working together, so just knocking the rust off on double-teams and stuff like that, making sure we\u2019re going the right way, the little things rookies go through. \u201cBut physically, his development, his understanding of our play-calling, the game, our scheme: He\u2019s way ahead of where I would\u2019ve been at this point in training camp my rookie year.\u201d Miller, the No. 15 overall pick in April\u2019s draft, is working with the first-team offense as Penn works his way back from foot surgery. It\u2019s a notable situation given Miller also represents a potential successor to Penn, who is 35 and has two seasons left on his contract. The Raiders have an open job at right tackle as well but had Miller work on the left side for all of spring practices. Penn has indicated he does not intend to hand the job to Miller, tweeting the word \u201cmotivation\u201d on draft night and reportedly making a piqued phone call to Jon Gruden. Yet Penn has also appeared to take a role in Miller\u2019s development while sidelined. While the offensive line ran position drills at Saturday\u2019s practice at Napa\u2019s Memorial Stadium, Penn stood nearby watching and spoke to Miller a few times between reps. Asked which teammates he has leaned on for advice, Miller named right guard Gabe Jackson and Penn.  \u201cEspecially Donald Penn - that happened a lot in the spring,\u201d Miller said. \u201cI\u2019d be in the back and he\u2019d be telling me, \u2018You can be doing this and sitting back.\u2019 He has a lot of tips for me, especially him being as experienced as he is.\u201d Miller played just one full season at left tackle at UCLA, but the Raiders were attracted to him in the draft by what Gruden termed his \u201chuge upside\u201d and his mix of athleticism and size (6-8, 309 pounds). Osemele said that given that frame, Miller\u2019s ability to move \u201ctakes you by surprise.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s real athletic, man,\u201d Osemele said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever going to be a case of him getting beat (by) somebody just running around him or anything like that. With a guy like that, it\u2019s going to be him working on his anchor, just being in the weight room and getting stronger and stuff.\u201d Miller said he did put on weight this summer, though he declined to say how much because \u201cit varies.\u201d Others including quarterback Derek Carr noticed a difference. \u201cYou can tell that he put in a lot of work in the weight room before he came back,\u201d Carr said. \u201cHe came back and he\u2019s strong, ready to take those bull-rushes. As a tall guy you know that\u2019s coming, you know the bull-rush is coming. But he\u2019s ready. He looks really good.\u201d In April, Gruden said one reason the Raiders had drafted two offensive tackles was the glut of talented pass rushers they face in the AFC West. The Raiders themselves moved Bruce Irvin to more of a defensive end role this summer to enhance their own pass rush, and while working with the first team, Miller figures to see plenty of Irvin coming off the edge in practice.  \u201cHe\u2019s blocking a beast over there,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cBruce Irvin is one of our captains right now and he\u2019s going to test Miller every day.\u201d Miller said he\u2019d welcome the challenge - especially after the team dons pads for the first time Sunday. \u201cI think it can only help me,\u201d Miller said. \u201c(Irvin) has a lot of tools that he uses, a lot of moves, which means you have to really hone your craft. He wants you to mess up. So that\u2019s something you have to focus on and make sure you don\u2019t do, because then he can get you.\u201d Miller said he benefited from practicing with other rookies last week before veterans reported to camp. He\u2019s admittedly \u201cnot a real talkative guy\u201d but said he felt more comfortable making calls and was \u201cpretty vocal out there\u201d Friday. It\u2019s part of the learning curve of a player for whom the Raiders have high hopes. \u201cAs far as the framework of being an elite left tackle, he has the tools there,\u201d Osemele said. \u201cI think it\u2019s really up to us to get him where he needs to be.\u201d  Matt Kawahara is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

{"content": "Aug. 03--In this analytically changing world of baseball, Cubs manager Joe Maddon maintains the components of playing exceptional defense and displaying astute baserunning still matter when considering a Most Valuable Player candidate.Maddon hopes Javier Baez's overall skills will weigh more heavily on the minds of National League MVP voters than his .329 on-base percentage and 16 walks, which pale in comparison with other candidates whose numbers are more statistically pleasing.\"There have been a number of anomaly players that are able to put the fat part of the bat on the ball, even when it might not be within the parameters,\" Maddon said. \"That's an easy discussion. It's part of the times we live in. I don't think anyone wants to believe somebody who doesn't have (an on-base percentage) at least 50 (points) higher than his batting average should be worthy of an MVP.\"But look at what he's doing. It gets very weird, watered down too much for me sometimes. It's just a batting average being worthy of an MVP. Back in the day, some relievers won Cy Young (Awards), and they pitched once in a while and threw not nearly the number of innings that a starter pitched. I just think that's the moment we live in now, where it wouldn't have been as big of an issue 20 years ago.\"Unfortunately for Baez and the Cubs, his supporting cast has struggled recently. They mustered only three hits Thursday night in losing 6-1 to the Padres at Wrigley Field.Albert Almora Jr. is in a 1-for-20 rut, and Anthony Rizzo was 0-for-11 before collecting an infield hit in the eighth.\"We haven't been overly sharp with the bat on any kind of consistent basis,\" Maddon said.Baez's streak of getting at least one extra-base hit and driving in at least one run ended with an 0-for-4 performance.Left-hander Mike Montgomery was pulled with a 1-0 lead after walking Eric Hosmer with one out in the sixth. Newcomer Jesse Chavez, who had not allowed a run in his first six games with the Cubs, surrendered a three-run homer to Austin Hedges.\"I wanted to go farther,\" Montgomery said after throwing 79 pitches. \"That's not up to me. That's how the game works. So I'm fine with the decisions (Maddon) makes.\"Said Maddon: \"(Montgomery) wasn't overly sharp but got out of jams.\"Meanwhile, left-handers Justin Wilson and Brian Duensing failed to keep the game close, fueling the expectation that Carl Edwards Jr. and Brandon Kintzler could be used more often against left-handed hitters in high leverage situations.Among the three MVP candidates mentioned most frequently -- Braves first baseman Freddie Freeman, Rockies third baseman Nolan Arenado and Baez -- Freeman has the highest batting average (.315) and on-base percentage (.397) and is second to Arenado (55) with 54 walks.Baez trails both with a .296 batting average, but he leads the NL with 83 RBIs and is second to Arenado (231) with 224 total bases. In addition to playing Gold Glove-caliber defense at second base, Baez has filled in capably at third in place of injured Kris Bryant and at shortstop when Addison Russell was nagged by leg soreness and an irritated knuckle.\"He's playing with so much confidence right now, the point I want to make is just don't evaluate based on batting average as being an MVP-worthy number,\" Maddon said.mgonzales@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "435"}
{"content": "A rallying cry from users to clean up social networks hasn\u2019t been without consequences \u2014 on Friday, July 27, Twitter reported a loss of about a million monthly active users in the U.S., just days after Facebook posted the slowest user growth in several years. Monthly active users in the U.S. dropped from 69 million to 68 million, while international users remained steady at 267 million.Twitter says the drop in user count is largely attributed to repurposing resources designed to encourage growth to instead enhance platform health and implement practices from the new General Data Protection Regulation laws in Europe. The company says that creating a healthier social network has short-term consequences but predicts the changes will contribute to long-term growth. Following a major rule overhaul last year, Twitter is continuing to respond to user criticism on how the platform handles abuse and spam.In its report, Twitter says the network is now removing twice as many accounts for violating spam policies as it did last year, identifying 9 million potential spam accounts every week and preventing 50,000 fewer spam sign-ups each day. That results in 8,000 fewer average spam reports on the network every day.Many of the spam numbers are caught at sign-up and never included in the company\u2019s user count, however, so the drive to curb spam isn\u2019t responsible for that one million user drop. Twitter instead says that moving staff to focus on network health and the GDPR laws is responsible for a larger chunk of that decline than removing spam accounts.While the monthly numbers dropped for the second quarter, the daily active user count illustrates an increase in engagement for the users already on the microblogging network. The year-over-year growth for daily active users was 11 percent over the previous year, slightly higher than the 10 percent from the first quarter. Twitter says that growth was from product improvements and marketing, as well as organic growth. Twitter lists the expanded Happening Now section, which encompasses breaking news and sports Tweets, as one of the tools promoting increased engagement. Video will also continue to be a focus for the network, the report says.Twitter expects another decline in monthly active users for the next quarter, but the company is banking on the changes designed to prevent spam and abuse creating a stronger network in the long run. While the user count dropped from numbers earlier this year, the count is 9 million users higher than the same time last year. Over time, the network will move back to the investment in product and engineering to spark growth and that the reallocation for GDPR and platform health that caused the user decline is temporary.Despite the drop in user count, Twitter posted a healthy 24 percent year-over-year revenue growth and even beat Wall Street predictions by a penny. The user numbers, however, has investors worried about the future of the platform, causing Twitter shares to fall after the company shared the second-quarter results.", "id": "436"}
{"content": "Aug. 01--In its greatest moments, the Chicago theater has invented entirely new forms of creative expression.In 1955, for example, David Shepherd created a comedy-cabaret group called the Compass Players. Shepherd wanted to be as artistically reactive as possible to societal change. He ended up parenting what is now known as improv.In the early 1990s, Lookingglass Theatre created a very distinct visual aesthetic for its ensemble-driven shows; a crucial addition to a Midwestern theater scene that mostly had been trapped in domestic realism.And if you lived in Chicago in the 2000s, before Redmoon Theater flamed out, you'll recall that company being almost impossible to describe to someone who never had seen their work. It was that distinctive -- spectacle-oriented but not quite circus, homemade but hipster-friendly, kid-simple but not, story-based but never fully comfortable with narrative cohesion.Which brings me to Manual Cinema, which has a very cool show right now at the Chopin Theatre, \"The End of TV.\" It's a very tough ticket.Manual Cinema also feels like a completely fresh direction -- the company hand-makes a movie right before your eyes, combining live actors in front of a green screen with cutaway images, music and puppetry. You watch the film, and you watch it being made. That's the brand.It is very stimulating, which is a good thing in our present moment, when I sometimes think that most theater does not offer enough stimulation of the senses, especially for a Generation Z audience now used to watching several screens at a time. How will live performance compete with that?At \"The End of TV\" (a title that can be understood on many different levels), if you get bored with the story, you can turn your attention to how the story is being made.As I watched the show the other night, it felt to me that Manual Cinema was really on to something important: The need not only for audiences to find lots of different ways into a show but also for transparency of manufacture.\"The End of TV\" is the perfect piece of theater for people who spend a lot of their time listening to podcasts. It actually feels like a podcast -- except there is somewhere for your eyes to go.The theater has been very slow to understand this seismic change in how we consume the arts: Most companies still conceal their backstage areas from the public, as if any revelation thereof will spoil the illusion. You're only supposed to watch what the artists want you to watch. This has been the theater's historic role for at least 200 years, of course, but it's showing its age. These days, people like to be involved in their own curation, they do not necessarily want to consume their culture at the whim of an artistic director other than themselves.At the Marriott Theatre last weekend, I watched something go wrong in a show called \"Murder For Two,\" and what the actors did to cover up the technical glitch was far more entertaining than the show itself. For it was the most alive.Manual Cinema has been around since 2010, when it was founded by Drew Dir, Sarah Fornace, Ben Kauffman, Julia Miller and Kyle Vegter. I have reviewed its work before -- the show prior to \"The End of TV\" was \"The Magic City\" at Chicago Children's Theatre. There has also been several collaborations with such groups as Hubbard Street Dance.But if you really look at how much Manual Cinema has produced, you realize that there really has not been all that many pieces. That's because they are fiendishly time-consuming and complex to create. They are not built and rehearsed in a month. The other thing that has happened to the company is that the word is very much out about its work -- Manual Cinema now is spending most of its time touring to other markets. Most Chicagoans have never heard its name.I'd also add that Manual Cinema, unlike many of its peers, has never engaged in much self-promotion.Yet the company, which has affiliated itself with the University of Chicago at various points, is an obvious candidate for civic spectacles of a distinctive kind -- it could be the natural successor to Redmoon.If it wants to be.The work certainly is ideal for kids (as \"The Magic City\" proved), especially since Manual Cinema encourages you to come backstage (not that there is a backstage in the usual sense) after the show and see how the images are created.But \"The End of TV\" is very much an adult show, given its inherent sadness and thematic complexity. Moreover, you can appreciate Manual Cinema without understanding the English language; this is not work dependent on words, but on the building of images and the expression of poignant and profound ideas about how we build and then mess up our great cities.And the lives of the people who inhabit them.Chris Jones is a Tribune critic.cjones5@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "437"}
{"content": "The Baltimore Ravens take on the Chicago Bears in the 2018 Hall of Fame Game, but what should fans be watching for from Baltimore?On Thursday night, the Baltimore Ravens will take on the Chicago Bears in the 2018 Hall of Fame Game. Ravens fans should be excited for this one, as should every NFL fan as it means that football is back.All the offseason moves, along with the epic 2018 draft by general manager Ozzie Newsome in his farewell season, has the Hall of Fame Game filled with as much anticipation as any preseason football game ever. With high hopes for the upcoming season, here\u2019s what you should be watching for from the Ravens in this matchup.1. The Tight End BattleThe first look at the depth chart released by the Ravens shows six tight ends fighting for about four \u2014 maybe five \u2014 roster spots. Not to mention, the starting job is still wide open. The depth chart shows Nick Boyle and Maxx Williams being the early favorites, but there is a lot of practice and preseason football to be played.Boyle has the most reps with the first team as the much anticipated second-rounder Williams hasn\u2019t proven he can stay healthy. Vince Mayle is at the three spot with two talented rookies behind him. Hayden Hurst is the guy the Ravens drafted in the first round in 2018. He is the Ravens\u2019 hopeful heir to the throne. Mark Andrews was selected in the third round out of Oklahoma. Andrews is the better blocker, while Hurst is the better receiver.However, tight end is a difficult position for a rookie to walk in and have immediate success. They will have to prove they understand the route tree and all the blocking schemes before Harbaugh trusts either enough to put them on the field in the regular season.The final spot is occupied by the 23-year old undrafted free agent Nick Keizer out of Grand Valley State. The tight end position is wide open, and the Ravens need one of these guys to step up and be a star.2. Orlando Brown Jr.Regardless of who is taking snaps at the end of this season, the Ravens must continue to improve in pass protection, especially at the tackle positions. The Ravens tried to address the issue in this year\u2019s draft. Orlando Brown Jr. could be the steal of the draft. All pre-combine mock drafts had Brown going in the first round as the top one or two tackles off the board, but Brown had a historically terrible Combine. This result caused Brown to fall to Baltimore in the third round.  Keep an eye on the right side of that offensive line. The Ravens need to find some consistency at right tackle. If Brown can prove his Combine numbers don\u2019t matter by producing on the field, he may overtake James Hurst for the No. 1 spot at right tackle on the depth chart.3. The QB BattleIn case you haven\u2019t heard, the Ravens selected a quarterback in the first round of the 2018 NFL Draft. Teams don\u2019t draft players in the first round they expect to sit on the bench. No matter how bad we love it or hate it, all indication points to Joe Flacco\u2019s days being numbered. Even if you don\u2019t like the draft pick, the Raven\u2019s hopeful quarterback of the future gives us a reason to watch preseason football.Former Heisman Trophy winner Lamar Jackson will make his NFL preseason debut on Thursday. This guy is so much fun to watch. He is probably the fastest quarterback since Michael Vick. He loves making plays with his feet and is a capable passer as well. Robert Griffin III has also signed with the Ravens this offseason. He will be fighting for a roster spot at the backup quarterback position with Lamar Jackson.", "id": "438"}
{"content": "Aug. 03--A fledgling network can invest heavily in a campaign to raise its profile and break into public consciousness, or it can do what it does and hope people notice.Ohio State's Urban Meyer saved Chicago-based Stadium a lot of money.If Wednesday was a pivotal moment for Meyer and his highly ranked Buckeyes football program, so too was it for Stadium.The multiplatform, Jerry Reinsdorf-backed sports network that's not quite a year old had the TV interview helping drive the news cycle.In the absence of their own video, ESPN and others had to keep running Stadium's clip as they sought to catch up to the news concerning Meyer's suddenly uncertain future as Ohio State's coach.There was Courtney Smith detailing allegations of domestic abuse by her ex-husband, recently fired Buckeyes assistant coach Zach Smith.She spoke of the fears that for so long kept her silent and said she believed Meyer knew of her predicament as it was unfolding, although he had publicly denied it as recently as last week.All of it ran with Stadium's logo and the word \"exclusive\" in the upper-right corner of the screen everywhere the clip was shown -- which was almost everywhere, it seemed.\"I just tried to get out of her way and let her tell her story for the most part,\" Stadium's Kristen Balboni, who recorded the piece the day before in Ohio, said Thursday.\"She was very forthcoming in terms of what she was willing to tell us, and I made sure she knew the stakes of talking about all this and that there could be negative backlash. She just felt now was the time for a variety of different reasons. She was very forthright, very open ... about everything.\"Coming out within a couple of hours of a damning report posted Wednesday to Facebook by Brett McMurphy, a laid-off ESPN reporter making optimal use of his supposed downtime, the one-two punch precipitated Ohio State placing Meyer on paid leave while it investigates and weighs options.McMurphy conducted his own interview with Courtney Smith and obtained text messages between her and other wives of Buckeyes coaches, including Meyer's spouse, Shelley.And this too was a score for Stadium.That's because McMurphy -- who joked on Twitter that the Meyer story gave him more face time on \"SportsCenter\" on Wednesday than he had enjoyed in his previous five years at ESPN -- reportedly is headed soon to Stadium once freed of the constraints of his old ESPN deal.Balboni, a one-time researcher for ESPN's \"Mike &amp; Mike\" and host of Fox Sports' \"At the Buzzer,\" joined Stadium earlier this year as a sideline reporter and host. She said others at Stadium had pursued the interview, and she came aboard the project only in recent days.\"For me, it came together very quickly because I was brought on once they had secured the interview,\" Balboni said. \"I don't have a ton of experience with this type of journalism, but I've never felt more supported.\"We had a lot of meetings. Everybody, the head of each department, was there. We really talked about tone and ... we talked about the best way to approach this because this is the first time Stadium has done anything in terms of an exclusive like this.\"Stadium's first Courtney Smith clip came out on Twitter, clocking in at 2 1/2 minutes. An 11-minute version of the interview was part of its \"Campus Insiders\" program before a full-length 19-minute clip was issued.That's consistent with the \"as you like it\" approach Stadium favors, in which its content can be consumed in various formats and platforms, from over the air as a digital subchannel in many markets to its website, as well as social media outlets and platforms with which it has partnered.But perhaps the biggest push this time came from rival media outlets eager to put a human face and voice to the allegations at the center of a significant story.\"I was conscious it could be a really big story and certainly could have big implications, but I don't think I expected it to be of this magnitude,\" Balboni said.\"Everyone here is really proud of how we did the interview. This is a very sensitive subject and we're proud of how we handled it and got her story across.\"It didn't do badly getting Stadium's story across either.philrosenthal@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "439"}

{"content": "Happiness, to some people, is a foreign terminology. When one is asked what they would wish for their family, many people say happiness. Money is said, but only because we tend to think that it will bring you joy; it helps, but it is not the catalyst for your glee.If you have stared out your window and realized that your life is slipping away and you are not happy, now is the time to change that. You can find pure joy and contentment in yourself, and it does not have to come from other people. Work on yourself, and you will discover the delight you so desperately desire.     Here are 10 happiness hacks to help you find happiness within yourself.Make someone happyBringing joy to other people can make you happy. You can give a compliment, smile at them, or send them a gift, anything to bring joy to the other person. When you are compassionate to others, you receive a natural \u201chigh\u201d that makes you happy. Do it today, and you will appreciate it.Christine Carter who is from the University of California, Berkeley states that the number of friends we have and their quality positively affects our well-being.     Challenge yourselfWhen you try new things, such as yoga, chess, learn a new game, or visit a new place, all of these will stimulate your mind and you will be happier.Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, a psychologist, states that creative, learning new skills, or artistic activities when performed relate to having a better approach to life.ExerciseWe don\u2019t always follow through with our exercise routines, we either change our minds or decide we become tired of hitting the gym. It is known that exercise is a sure mood-booster.     A study done in Harvard states that the well-being of people who are physically active is higher than those who do not engage in physical exercises. Most people believe that exercising is too difficult to increase your happiness, but try going to hit the gym. You can walk, ride a bike or hike, choose your form of exercise.GratitudeLook around you and appreciate the people who are in your life. Send a text or tell your parents, friends, or colleagues that you are thankful that they are in your life.You can list down the good things that have happened in your life, think of the good experiences you have had with your family, friends or children. This will naturally boost your mood.Let life flowDo not challenge yourself too much that you lose what is important to you. Chasing money or fame will not make you happy on its own. Linda Esposito of LCSW, states, \u201cThe concept of \u201ceveryone\u201d does not exist when it comes to experiencing joy.\u201dYou need to find what makes you happy and not how you should attain it. Do not listen or let people dictate to you how you should achieve happiness that is all on you.In the genesAccording to psychologist David Lykken, our \u201cset points\u201d of how happy we can be is on our genes, but whether we can overcome that point is all dependent on our experience and training.If your \u201cset point\u201d is low, you can encourage yourself to achieve more and be happy by practicing positive thinking.Be truthfulAccording to the author of The Liar in Your Life, and a psychologist at the University of Massachusetts Robert Feldman, 60% of people, cannot go through a 10-minute conversation without lying.That is a considerable number. To not lie is not an easy thing, but when you are honest, your conscience is clear and you know that there are no consequences that you are waiting for.Listen to your heartWhen you are satisfied with all you have and you know it is enough, you will always be happy. Most often than not we try and compare ourselves with others and feel low when they have what we desire.A study conducted in the 1980s by the University of Northern British Columbia discovered that people who are in search for career success, money, fame or friends are less happy than those who are not in the same quest. Be content with what you have regardless of what your family and friends say or have.Enjoy the simple pleasuresThe sun, grass under your feet, starry nights, thunderstorms, the ones you love, or treasured memories, enjoy them. The simple pleasures and things in life are a sure way of making yourself happy.Be with those who make you smileWe are happiest when we are around those who make us happy, as studies have shown. Be around people who bring you joy, and when you are together, your time is spent in laughter and tears of joy.Try and steer clear of those people who consistently bring you down. Toxic or narcissistic people should be a no-no in your life. Do not be dragged into an unnecessary drama that will only make you sad or angry.ConclusionCultivate a spirit of looking for happiness within yourself. This way, you will not rely on other people. The more you look within yourself, the more likely you are to achieve it.Always be thankful for the small joys in life and blessing that are there in your life. For a fulfilled and peaceful existence, try and practice these happiness hacks. Understand what works for you and this will be the first step to the journey of finding your joy.", "id": "441"}

{"content": "Conspiracies are hard. They're even harder when you're stupid.They are, however, deeply compelling. Some people need a single, grand unifying theory of why the world refuses to line up with their expectations. When difficult realities confront people without the intellectual horsepower to understand and accept the truth, some turn to conspiracy theories to paper over the holes in their worldview. No matter how absurd, baroque, and improbable, conspiracies grow on their own like mental kudzu where inconsistencies aren't signs of illogical conclusions, but of another, deeper layer of some hidden truth, some skein of powerful forces holding the world in its grip.After Trump's rally in Tampa this week, the notorious QAnon scam became America's conspiracy of the moment. And why not? In the face of Donald Trump's daily meltdowns, mood swings, and unmedicated rage episodes in which he lashes out at every target in reach, his base is desperately looking for a version of reality that gives them some comfort and stability.This Q conspiracy is filling the political bloodstream of the Trumpentariat and has been bubbling up inside the right for the last few months, and while Will Sommer and others have covered the story, there seemed to be a media shock moment after the Qbots showed up at Trump\u2019s Tampa rally. Conspiracies -- this one in particular -- give their devotees a sense of coherence that is lacking in everything Trump does. QAnon presents Donald Trump as the character he plays on TV; bold, commanding, strategic, and brilliant...as opposed to the real Donald Trump, who displays the dignity, intelligence, and honesty of a strip-club tout with tertiary syphilis. In Q's world, Donald Trump is courageously leading an effort to round up and punish -- I'm not exaggerating -- tens of thousands of child predators who occupy the highest reaches of government. Q and Don, side by side, doling out the secret knowledge to the new elite. Instead of getting a clearance, all you need to do is check out 4chan, Reddit, or YouTube.Some even believe Q composes these messages for their eager consumption and interpretation at Trump's direction, the amanuensis to an orange Nostradamus whose quatrains appear on the same image boards that feature bronie porn, hentai spank-bank material, and tween Neo-Nazi shitposter incels, instead of penned on parchment. They're desperate to believe \"Q\" is a senior official cleared at the highest levels (as one former NSA official jokingly called it, \u201cTS/SCI NOSEBLEED\u201d) who busily leaks cryptic messages to them. Set aside that the Q clearance is a Department of Energy designation, and is for access to particular nuclear weapons matters, not the Bondian highest-reaches-of-government shenanigans to which Q claims access; this entire thing reeks of enough bullshit to fertilize Mars.The claims of Q-Anon make Nostradamus look like Hemingway. Naturally, they're elliptical, variable, and impossible to cross-check. Hundreds of YouTube videos, blog posts tweets, Facebook items, and speculation follow each post, a Confederacy of Dunces that ramifies this idiocy out into dumber and dumber dead ends. QAnon asks its believers to \"follow the breadcrumbs\" and fill in the blanks. Those blanks get filled with epic idiocy.The glee with which the followers of this absurdity latch on to imaginary deportations of Hillary Clinton, John Podesta, and others to Gitmo is notable. Several times, Q has promised them that any moment now the rest of the Deep State will occupy the darkest holes of the American prison system. QAnon tells them that retribution is at hand, and they\u2019re ravenous for more. Lurid and exciting for the rubes, but as of yet, Hillary Clinton walks free. If that even is Hillary Clinton, and not a shapeshifting reptilian overlord.Those of us with the unfortunate awareness of the clownishly risible QAnon conspiracy cult have been reveling in the comedy gold, lavishly overwrought, dangerously stupid proclamations of Q for months. We've alternated between laughter and wide-eyed shock at how credulous Trump\u2019s Army of Cletuses must be to fall for such an obvious, ludicrous con. Then again, Donald Trump put the \u201ccon\u201d in \u201cconspiracy\u201d as far back as his embrace of birtherism. If the puzzle surrounding QAnon is a fever dream wrapped in an enigma, coated with nougat, rolled in nuts and filled with a creamy center of delusional paranoia, Trump's own role in fostering it is right out of the Lil Tots' First Book of Authoritarian Strategy.For actual authoritarians and the merely dictator-curious, building a separate, hermetic truth defined only by the Dear Leader is 101 stuff, and goes hand in hand with the relentless attacks on the free press an enemy of the people. Of course, it's just trolling. It\u2019s just a prank by some chan-autists. It makes me shake my head to explain to people that the idea of a conspiracy this grand and elaborate has as much chance of working as Skeeter's plan to cook meth in the WalMart bathroom.Why has Q eaten the Trump-right's minds? Why does it work on them when it's so obviously, evidently a gigantic pyramid of digital horseshit? It works because stupid people are stupid and because Donald Trump's Administration loves what QAnon does to stoke the fires of paranoia, resentment, and division. QAnon works for Trump because people who are not knowledgeable of the world, politics, government, the intelligence community and reality more broadly are desperately looking for confirmation that they're on the winning team. Q tells them that they're on the right side of history and that for once in their dreary little lives they and only they possess the secret, hermetic knowledge from inside the esoteric cult. Q represents where the former GOP has gone in the era of Trump; possessed the desire to have a private space that makes even Fox News look mild in comparison, grasping desperately for a different reality.When even aggressive conspiracy-pusher faux-journalist loons and alt-lite thought leaders Mike Cernovich and Jack Posobiec find QAnon too crazy to promote, it should make you pause. Both men were aggressive promoters of the Pizzagate theory, in which a Washington D.C. restaurant was falsely alleged to be the center of a global child sex-trafficking, cannibalism and prostitution ring. Both were all-in on the cruel and false Seth Rich story, and a raft of other pro-Trump efforts to mainline fantasy conspiracies into the American body politics. If it's too crazy for those edge cases, it's too crazy.No, Trump fans, the storm isn't coming. There is no Great Awakening. \"Where we go one we go all\" is a path to disappointment and madness, not to some brave new future where Donald Trump's genius and his army of secret soldiers purge America of a vast, secret deep state of hostile insiders and pedophiles. Q is a meta-hoax, a recursive scam in service of a scam called the Trump Presidency. The \"drops\" are meaningless claptrap, noise without real signal, and most certainly not the signs of the new reality its eager marks desire.", "id": "443"}
{"content": "July 31--The Cubs moved into first place in the National League Central before the arrivals of pitchers Cole Hamels and Jesse Chavez from the Rangers.Jason Heyward believes that should serve as sufficient faith that the current core can reach the playoffs regardless of what transpires up to Tuesday's 3 p.m. trade deadline.\"If you don't have confidence going in from day one, then I don't feel like you deserve to be mentioned in the same breath of those (contenders) at the end,\" said Heyward, whose Cubs resume their quest to win a third straight division title Tuesday night against the resurgent Pirates at PNC Park.The Cubs (61-44) are 3-3 since slugger Kris Bryant returned to the 10-day disabled list because of recurring left shoulder inflammation. While the Cubs are encouraged because they have held ground, Heyward is aware that the division isn't as top heavy as in past seasons.As examples, the Pirates (55-52) have won 13 of their last 16 games. The last-place Reds are 45-43 since Jim Rigglemann took over as manager in April, and the stagnant Cardinals are 31-24 against the rest of the division.And after a rough finish to the first half, the second-place Brewers have won six of their last nine entering play late Monday night.\"Every team we play has confidence right now,\" Heyward said. \"This is one of those rare years.

Each team will play three contest, with no playoffs. Hopefully, a championship game is added in the future, so one of the teams gets bragging rights for a season.Anaheim\u2019s roster has yet to be announced, but it\u2019s fun to speculate what the potential lines could be. Last year, the Ducks brought several 24-year-old prospects to their rookie camp, so that will be the age cutoff used to construct my line combinations. Joseph Blandisi is 24 years old, but I don\u2019t think he attends the rookie camp since he\u2019s played professionally for several seasons. The same for Chase De Leo.Lines are likely to change every game and most of the prospects will play to some extent. There should be some consistency within the top 6, so I\u2019ll try to account for some of the extra bodies on the third and fourth lines. In part 1, I am focusing on what offensive line combinations I\u2019d like to see the Ducks use. Part two will be looking at defensive pairings and the goalies taking part in the showcase.", "id": "445"}
{"content": "Former St. Louis Cardinals star Matt Holliday makes his return to baseball. Could he really make a difference with his original team?Matt Holliday was a vital part to the  success in the last decade. With four All-Star appearances in his tenure with the Cardinals, he has shown that he is one of the top hitters in the game back when he was in his prime.Back in 2009, the Oakland Athletics traded Matt Holliday to the St. Louis Cardinals in exchange for a package of prospects, including Brett Wallace. He was already deemed as one of the best hitters in the game. He won three Silver Slugger awards during his tenure with the Colorado Rockies. He would make a big impact with the Cardinals and even contribute to a World Series title.Holliday was very solid during his tenure with the St. Louis Cardinals, slashing .293/.380/.494 with 156 dingers over eight seasons. He was named to the NL All-Star team four times and even won the Silver Slugger with the Cardinals in 2010. In 2016, Holliday left St. Louis and signed a 1-year deal with the New York Yankees.In his lone season with the New York Yankees, Holliday was mediocre, hitting for .231 to go with 19 home runs and driving in 64 as a designated hitter in an injury-plagued campaign. The Yanks did not bring him back. They acquired 2017 NL MVP Giancarlo Stanton to serve as the DH for them, leaving no room for Matt Holliday.The 38-year-old did not find a team to sign with during free agency. He looked to make a return to baseball, and his original team, the Colorado Rockies, signed him to a minor league deal on Sunday morning.His best years were with the Rockies, with four All-Star appearances and three Silver Sluggers when he was with them. He even finished second in the NL MVP race in 2007, behind Jimmy Rollins of the Philadelphia Phillies.The Rockies are currently 56-47 and are only a half game behind the 2nd Wild Card spot, and two games behind the Los Angeles Dodgers, who lead the NL West currently. Holliday could potentially play a bench role in the Majors and be a part of the Rockies playoff push.Want your voice heard?

The Houston Astros have already made one deal with more likely on the way. Let\u2019s take a look at three players the team needs to avoid.The Houston Astros finally made their first move approaching the trade deadline. They acquired Martin Maldonado from the Angels for a low-level prospect. This is a very solid, very Jeff Luhnow move. Maldonado will add great defensive depth behind the plate.The team is surely not done wheeling and dealing just yet. There are several spots that the Houston Astros could look to add players at. Adding a reliever is probably the number one spot the team will look to acquire a player. There have also been some rumors of the Astros acquiring an outfielder or a first base/designated hitter type player.Luhnow is constantly looking at and evaluating players to see who could help the team. The vast majority of the time Luhnow is acquiring underrated players who can come in and help the team out in a specific way or two.Acquiring Justin Verlander last year was an anomaly in terms of Houston Astros trades. The team has frequently been linked to star players but, they have rarely been able to actually acquire them.Don\u2019t really expect the team to go out and acquire a big name at the deadline. However, that doesn\u2019t mean that there aren\u2019t players the team really should avoid. There are definitely players the team should stay away from whether it be due to cost or lack of upgrade or something else entirely.

The Forbidden Fruit of FAANG RealMoney's Martin Cassidy tackles Apple's Services segment of its business. \"We still expect Services to be the most important part,\" said AAP Portfolio analyst Zev Fima. \"If Services are strong it will be enough to offset any third-quarter disappointment in unit sales.\" Analysts on Tuesday reiterated their bullish valuations on the tech giant, expecting Apple to issue earnings of about $2.16 a share, according to FactSet. CFRA Research's Angelo Zino wrote that the expected introduction of an Apple television streaming platform would help drive Services growth for the company, predicting the segment would comprise nearly 20% of sales and a third of profits by 2019, with Services revenue of $50 billion in 2020. Apple is expected to release earnings right after the bell on Tuesday. The tech company will be the final FAANG stock to announce earnings, so it'll be the apple of everyone's eye if it can manage to avoid tanking like Facebook did after its earnings. And, no, I'm not sorry for that pun.  Apple is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS member club. Want to be alerted before Jim Cramer buys or sells AAPL? Learn more now. Eyeroll please... Lauren Simmons, the youngest and only full-time female stockbroker at the NYSE, sat down with TheStreet's Anders Keitz and Katherine Ross. She discussed a lot of interesting topics. And, when asked whether she thinks millennials don't invest she\u2014drumroll, please\u2014scoffed and rolled her eyes. So there you have it, folks. On a more serious note, Simmons tackled some tough subjects, most importantly financial literacy. She has some thoughts on financial literacy.  \"Learning credit and savings accounts and what investing can or can't do for you, that should be 1,2,3, courses that should be given at some point while you're younger\u2014definitely by the time you graduate high school,\" Simmons said. \"From there, [you can use] it as a platform to learn more but it definitely is important.\" Talking Tesla Ah, yes.  Tesla Inc. (TSLA) is slated to release earnings on Wednesday, Aug. 1.  TheStreet's Eric Jhonsa has listed some of the top things to look for when the earnings are released.  Of course, the earnings will heavily rely on Model 3 numbers. Any fresh comments on Model 3 production rates and targets are worth paying close attention to. As are any remarks about Model 3 reservations\u2014they stood at about 420,000 at the end of Q2\u2014and order activity. During the second week of July, more than two years after it began taking reservations for the car, Tesla opened the Model 3 order process to the general public, albeit while continuing to give reservation holders order priority. Also: Will Tesla offer any update on when it plans to start making the $35,000 Standard Battery version of the Model 3, and in what volumes? Musk previously said the $35,000 Model 3 would enter production in early 2019. For now, Tesla is only taking orders for versions of the Model 3 that cost $49,000 or more. While Model 3 output clearly picked up in Q2, it's still unknown what kind of margins Tesla saw on delivered cars, amid all of the extraordinary measures it took to hit its production target. Tesla reported in May its Model 3 gross margin (GM) was slightly negative in Q1, and forecast it would be \"close to breakeven\" in Q2 before becoming \"highly positive\" in Q3 and staying that way in Q4.

{"content": "Texas A&amp;M football is 34 days away, and in the days leading up to the Aggie opener we\u2019re answering the 50 biggest questions for the 2018 season.One of the biggest questions heading into the 2018 season for Texas A&amp;M football is their ability to replace production lost at the wide receiver position.Christian Kirk was a monster in his three seasons with Texas A&amp;M. He finished his career with 234 receptions, 2,856 yards and 26 touchdowns. He also added seven return touchdowns. The dynamic kid from Arizona was the 47th overall pick in the 2018 NFL Draft, and the Aggies will be looking for someone to assume his role as playmaker.Texas A&amp;M also lost Damion Ratley, who was second on the team with 694 yards on 30 receptions in 2017. He was a big play receiver who ended up being drafted by the Cleveland Browns in the sixth round of the NFL Draft (175th overall).Losing your top two weapons in the passing game is usually not easily replaceable, but the Aggies are well set up to do just that.They have an absurd number of of highly recruited sophomores ready and waiting to take the Aggie passing game to the next level. Camron Buckley, Roshauud Paul, Kendrick Rogers were all 3-star recruits in their class, and Hezekiah Jones, Quartney Davis and Klyde Chriss were each 4-star recruits, according to the 247 Sports composite rankings.But Jhamon Ausbon, the No. 73 overall player and No. 10 wide receiver from the 2017 class, is the best of the bunch, and will be the Aggies\u2019 leading receiver in 2018. Is he ready to take over and be an elite receiver in the SEC?Absolutely.The dynamic freshman was second on the team with 50 receptions in 2017. He came on very strong late in the year and got better as the season went along. He capped off his year with 12 receptions and 112 yards in the Belk Bowl, then had six catches with 124 yards in the Maroon And White Game, including a long of 58 yards.At 6-foot-2, 220 pounds, he has the ideal body for a receiver that can take punishment in the SEC, and obviously has the skills to take on SEC competition. He proved as much as a true freshman.The Aggies have an open competition to play opposite Ausbon, but make no mistake about it, he will be the team\u2019s best receiver this season and one of the best in the SEC.Jeff Shull is the Site Expert for the Gig Em Gazette on FanSided.

{"content": "Aug. 01--With Lollapalooza upon us, this marks the start of an awkward, yet delicate dance familiar to white rap music fans.At those pivotal festival moments when the cool, swaggering young rapper dips his mic toward the crowd in a gesture for them to finish the verse, lily-white patrons have an important decision to make:Do they repeat the verse that contains the most vilified word of our time, or quickly mumble it and avoid an awkward moment with any black fans? By \"it,\" of course, I'm talking about the conversation-killing N-word.Lately, the topic has gotten a lot of attention as hip-hop acts continue to diversify the largely-white music festival circuit at events like Coachella, South by Southwest, Union Park's recent Pitchfork festival and this week's Lollapalooza.Bronzeville rapper Noname addressed the issue at Pitchfork when she presented a new song that included the N-word as part of the chorus, but she included an alternative for white fans.\"I wrote this part so that you white people would have something to do, since y'all can't ever say that word,\" she told the crowd.But they do say it.That magic word brought last May's Hangout Festival in Alabama to a screeching halt when a young white fan dropped the N-bomb while rapping on stage with Kendrick Lamar during a set of his hit, \"m.A.A.d city.\"\"You gotta bleep one single word,\" the Pulitzer Prize-winning Lamar told the fan, according to published reports. \"Oh I'm sorry, did I do it?\" she was quoted as asking, surrounded by an angry, booing crowd.After a lifetime of being spoon-fed negative black images, the \"To Pimp A Butterfly\" star would like white America to let black people exclusively have the word, he recently told Vanity Fair.But the word is enjoying something of a pop culture renaissance in these early years of the 21st Century, well beyond its origin as the soul-crushing racial invective. In the last five decades the word has become a piece of performance art by black icons from Richard Pryor and Dave Chapelle to Drake and Childish Gambino, morphing it into cool slang for some young white rap-loving hipsters and others.You, too may have heard two white teenagers using the word when speaking to one another. I was certainly reminded of this when I fell in with a diverse group of 20-somethings at the recent Wicker Park Fest. There, I met a group of friends whose ethnic backgrounds included white, African-American, Latino and Middle Eastern.With music from a car radio droning in the background, I listened to the friends pepper their sentences with the n-word when referring to ex-boyfriends, bosses, authority figures or any troublesome presence. It wasn't, however, used in any racial sense. One of the friends, a young woman whose family came from Palestine, told me that she wasn't trying to be offensive, but expressed herself that way, she said with Cardi B's confidence.But using that word has real world consequences, especially from older African-Americans who still bristle at its casual use and support its retirement. Social media is awash in videos of whites and non-African-Americans saying the word, then follow-up videos of them losing their careers or being otherwise publicly scorned. Last year, an friend who is also African-American, told me of how a young white co-worker tried used the N-word with him, not as a slur, but as two black friends would.He did not feel that love and complained to supervisors. Her attempts to connect with him were a failure and she was quickly fired.Last year writer Brian Joseph wrote for Spin magazine about how some rappers had begun scaling back use of the N-word as more hip-hop acts joined the white festival circuit.While stars like Lamar and Chance the Rapper are in the \"It's our word\" camp, the same article also interviewed younger rappers, including Chicago star G Herbo, who suggest that younger stars aren't taking the same stance.\"If a white person says (it) and he's saying my lyrics, I don't take it for nothing but that,\" he told the magazine.Further complicating matters is how the word's original racial use (ending in \"er\") has been usurped to become a friendly term, expressing shared struggle, or just a general one (ending in \"a\"). \"Sometimes there may be a situation where I call a white person (that),\" G Herbo told Spin.A.D. Carson, an assistant professor of hip-hop for the University of Virginia's music department, knows this tightrope.A native of downstate Decatur who performs under the name AyDee The Great, Carson both rejects the notion of the N-word as cool slang, though he has used it and doesn't dissuade his own UVA students from using it in his rap songwriting course.\"I don't know if the word is losing its negative connotation. My instinct says no, but I know there are all kinds of layers being continually added, peeled back, folded into others, and hopefully forcing us to think critically,\" he said.\"Context is, and always will be, important. The further we get from that, I think, the more reckless we get with our understanding of word work.\"So should we kill the word and bury it once and for all, or keep it around for scientific and artistic purposes? Whatever decision we make, those kids rapping along this weekend should remember that word, whether sang, rapped, or yelled, still has power.wlee@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "453"}

{"content": "July 31--The Cambrian Park Little League Junior All-Star baseball team had 26 days between its District 12 championship win and its next game, the opening round of the Junior League West Regional Tournament.But the layoff didn't affect host Cambrian Park, which used good plate discipline in a 16-1 four-inning victory over the Dixie Little League squad from St. George-Utah.Cambrian Park used 13 walks, including nine in a 10-run third inning, to help distance itself from its opponent on Saturday at Ida Price Middle School.\"Our guys are pretty seasoned hitters, and they have a good approach at the plate,\" said Cambrian Park manager Jason Pearson.Pitching-wise, Cambrian Park's Jason Khalid and Rian Smart combined for a no-hitter in the four-inning game. Khalid started and faced just two batters over the minimum. Dixie scored in the second inning on a walk, two groundouts and an error. Smart finished up by facing the minimum six batters in two innings, walking one but picking him off at first.Khalid said he was concentrating on throwing strikes \"because I knew our defense would make good plays out there and I knew they had my back.\"The game was close through the first two innings. Cambrian Park scored in the top of the first when Takeru Moriyama reached base on an error, stole second base and scored on an RBI single to left field by Brody Pearson. Moriyama also had an outstanding game defensively at second base.With the score tied at 1 entering the third inning, Cambrian Park proceeded to put the game out of reach.With one out and Andrew Adkison on first, Pearson walked. The two players executed a double steal proficiently as Cambrian Park took the lead for good at 2-1.After walks to Smart and Khalid, Pearson scored on an error. Pinch hitter Kento Mita walked to drive in another run, then Jack Smith drove in two runs with a single to right field for a 6-1 Cambrian Park lead.That would be the last hit of the inning, as five of the next six Cambrian Park batters walked as the team took an 11-1 lead.In the fourth inning, the first three Cambrian Park batters walked before a single by Moriyama drove in two runs for a 13-1 advantage. The leadoff hitter was 2 for 3 with two RBI and three runs scored in the game, as he walked and reached base on an error in his first two at-bats.Adkison followed in the fourth inning with an RBI single up the middle. An RBI groundout by Pearson made the score 15-1 and Adkison scored on a wild pitch for the eventual final run of the game.Pearson was 1 for 2 at the plate with two walks, three RBI and two runs scored. Smith was 1 for 2 with a walk, two runs scored and two RBI. Adkison was 1 for 3 with a walk, two runs scored and an RBI. Khalid was 1 for 1 with two walks and a run scored.In the second round on Sunday, Cambrian Park fell 12-3 to Montana. Results of Cambrian Park's next tournament games were unavailable at press time.___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "455"}
{"content": "A critical season is ahead for the Dallas Cowboys as many players have lingering questions, but who will be their leaders in the major statistical areas?There are more questions surrounding members of the Dallas Cowboys this season than any in recent memory. After a slump of a campaign in 2017, concerns are all over the place. Head coach Jason Garrett is once again on the hot seat, despite being just one full season from winning the NFL Coach of the Year Award. He navigated them to a successful 2016 season despite injuries, but couldn\u2019t get the team to the playoffs during a season filled with drama.Running back Ezekiel Elliott was front and center with the off-field problems as he had a near season-long battle with the league over a pending suspension. With him gone and the offensive line having injuries, quarterback Dak Prescott struggled at times. He too has a giant question mark over his head as they enter this critical season.Whether or not they can shake those concerns has yet to be seen. What we can do is look ahead and predict which players they will lean heaviest on. Here we do that by predicting what players will lead the team in each major statistical area.Of course, with Prescott penciled in as the starting quarterback we will skip that position. If he doesn\u2019t lead the team in every passing stat, then something went very wrong.", "id": "456"}
{"content": "July 30--The most common sexual fantasy among American adults involves bringing a third (or fourth) person into the mix, according to the largest-ever survey of the topic.In his new book, \"Tell Me What You Want: The Science of Sexual Desire and How It Can Help You Improve Your Sex Life\" (DaCapo), social psychologist and Kinsey Institute research fellow Justin Lehmiller spells out the findings of a massive survey involving 350 questions posed to 4,175 Americans ranging in age from 18 to 87.The participants, he writes, had occupations spanning everything from cashiers at McDonald's to homemakers to physicians to lawyers. They included all sexual and gender identities, political and religious affiliations, and relationship types, from single to married to swinger.What each of the participants did have in common was a willingness to talk about sex.\"Because this survey called for uninhibited discussion of sexual fantasies,\" Lehmiller writes, \"the people who chose to take part tended to have positive views about sex in general and were willing to openly report on their sex lives.\"So. The results. (Congratulations, if you actually read the previous four paragraphs and didn't simply skip ahead to this one.)Ninety-seven percent of surveyed Americans reported having sexual fantasies, which Lehmiller defines as \"any mental picture that comes to mind while you're awake that ultimately turns you on.\" (Sex dreams don't count, he maintains, since you don't have conscious control over them.)More than a third of respondents described group sex as their favorite fantasy. In fact, just 5 percent of men and 13 percent of women said group sex never crossed their minds.Threesomes were the most common group sex fantasy, Lehmiller found, with the gender ratio of partners varying quite a bit. Straight women frequently described threesome fantasies with another woman or two, while straight men tended to prefer two women to their one man.\"The appeal of threesomes has more to do with the fact that this activity creates a state of sensory overload than anything,\" Lehmiller writes. \"It's really about amping up our arousal by bringing in another body that we can look at, touch and experience in an overpowering way that allows us to get lost in sensations.\"BDSM -- bondage, discipline, dominance, submission, sadism and masochism -- is the second most popular fantasy, Lehmiller found, with more than a quarter of participants conjuring scenarios that involve physical restraints, giving and receiving pain, and role playing with power.(Lehmiller is careful to point out, more than once, that fantasies should only be acted out if the sexual activity is consensual and doesn't pose an unacceptable risk of harm to one or more people.)The third most popular fantasy -- the go-to image for one in five Americans -- involves novelty, adventure and variety: sex in a public place, new positions, bringing food into the mix.\"Perhaps not surprisingly, whipped cream, chocolate, ice cubes and strawberries were the foods of choice for most,\" Lehmiller writes. \"The rest had some rather interesting tastes, including blue cheese dressing, corn on the cob, dog food and gum from the 'Willy Wonka' movie.\"Now seems an appropriate time to mention that Lehmiller wants readers to receive his book with an open mind about their own and other people's fantasies.\"We are taught only what people are supposed to want, not what people actually want when it comes to sex,\" he writes. \"The end result is that when most Americans start having sex, their knowledge about it, and about which sexual feelings and practices are 'normal,' tends to be very low.\"That's due in part, he writes, to our lack of comprehensive sexual education in many schools.\"Our reluctance to teach students any sexual communication skills other than 'just say no' has led to an odd state of affairs in which Americans find it more challenging to talk about sex -- even with their own spouse or partner -- than to actually have it,\" he writes.By studying and revealing what Americans really have on their minds about sex, he hopes to chip away at some of the taboos surrounding people's desires.\"My bigger hope is that you will walk away with a greater understanding of the nature of sexual desire and, potentially, use that information to enhance your own sexual and romantic life.\"He encourages readers to share their fantasies with their partners.\"Self-disclosure builds trust,\" he writes. \"When someone reveals a major secret to us, it shows that they're putting a lot of faith in us -- and we tend to reciprocate by trusting them right back.\"He even spells out ways to break the ice: watch a steamy movie and discuss it afterward, visit a sex toy shop together, turn date night into an erotic Q&amp;A. (\"If you were creating your bucket list, what's one sexual experience you'd want to be sure to have before you die?\")\"Ultimately,\" Lehmiller writes, \"all of us stand to benefit from having a better understanding of each other's desires.\"My goal is to help break down the barriers to discussing sexual fantasies that exist in your own life, so that you might allow those fantasies -- the ones that are safe, legal and consensual -- to become part of your sexual reality.\"Happy reading.hstevens@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "457"}
{"content": "It was the second day in pads for the Saints as training camp 2018 starts to get in full swing. The weather was hot and the double moves were nasty.The New Orleans Saints went into day four of training camp on Sunday, July 29. The weather was the kind of hot you\u2019d expect in the Big Easy in late July and practice started out indoors before moving out into the heat.Fans were once again in attendance for the second of ten open practices, all of which are sold out. Much of the focus in Sunday\u2019s practice was on the offense, at least from a fan perspective. That\u2019s where the majority of the wow moments came.As a Who Dat, you have to be pretty stoked about what we\u2019re seeing on the field so far. Not that the offense was anything but awesome last year, but this training camp, it\u2019s looking completely stacked for 2018. Same thing with the defense.This squad is looking to be improved in a number of areas over last year and ready for the tough slate ahead. Of course, there\u2019s only so much you can see from watching guys in practice. But there were areas of concern coming out of 2017 that seem to be taken care of.We won\u2019t know if any of that is more than big hopes and expectations until Week 1 of the 2018 Season. But this team looks ready to make a run. Here are four takeaways from Sunday\u2019s practice.", "id": "458"}
{"content": "Hackers, scammers, gamers, DIY-ers \u2014 the internet has been a boon for a lot of people. But for media, it\u2019s largely been a disaster. Newspapers and magazines are trying to balance keeping their content affordable, accessible, and accurate, while still making enough dough to keep operations afloat. Information not trapped behind paywalls or subscription models runs the risk of being sponsored content, or just plain wrong. Social media has inflamed the issue, allowing users to share untrustworthy and unsavory news while dispensing with the traditional markers that would signal readers to be skeptical.The result: our current age of mistrust and misdirection, rife with well-financed \u201cfake news.\u201d And no one knows how to fix it. Facebook is expanding its army of fact checkers and moderators to stem the tide of misleading information on its platform. Congress is caught up in futile hearings about political bias in content filtering practices by social media giants, evading discussions of much more pressing matters (hint: they involve Russia).A new startup thinks it might have cracked it. Civil wants to be a platform where independent newsrooms can foster direct relationships with their readers, who can have a real stake \u2014 in the form of cryptocurrency \u2014 in supporting publications they trust.It\u2019s an ambitious project with a lot of moving parts, but the experiment is already underway. Back in October 2017, the Brooklyn-based company received $5 million in funding from blockchain platform ConsenSys, and expanded its operations to 24 full-time staff members. Now, with its token launch (what others in the same position might call an ICO or Initial Coin Offering) slated for August 13, more people are going to have to ask themselves: will it work?Here\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to work (it\u2019s a little complicated, so stick with me). Every community member (readers and journalists) gets to invest some of their real-life money to buy a certain number of Civil tokens. If readers think a particular newsroom is unethical in some way, they can \u201cchallenge\u201d it (details of the exact process are still unclear). Anyone with Civil tokens gets to vote on what they think is the right or \u201cethical\u201d side by gambling their Civil tokens towards it. Betters in the majority get rewarded with more tokens; those in the minority lose the tokens they bet.The same tokens could also be used to pay journalists (or at least tip them), using the smart contracts inherent to blockchain to set up a transparent kickback system for writers, editors, and illustrators that readers want to support.But Civil plans to leave the business decisions entirely to the newsrooms themselves. \u201cWe think it\u2019s important for newsrooms to maintain full independence from The Civil Media Company, as we never wish to exert undue editorial influence on them \u2014 even if it means an \u2018anti-Civil newsroom\u2019 launches on Civil \u2014 as long as they play by the rules, it\u2019s fair game,\u201d Civil Media Company co-founder Matt Coolidge tells Futurism.\u201cWe think it\u2019s important for newsrooms to maintain full independence from The Civil Media Company, as we never wish to exert undue editorial influence on them.\u201dYes, despite its laissez-faire attitude towards the business practices of individual newsrooms, Civil has done a lot to try to make sure only the most deserving news sources end up on its platform. The company is still in the process of crafting a full-blown Constitution  that lays out Civil\u2019s journalistic standards in detail. One of the elements the Constitution demands: a Civil Council, made up of journalism heavyweights. Civil Foundation CEO Vivian Schiller will appoint the Council (readers will appoint the next round) that will act as a court of appeals for any newsroom challenges that are particularly controversial and involve one or multiple infractions of the Constitution.\u201c[The Constitution] is the foundational document for all activity that occurs on the Civil platform. And more broadly, what will ensure that Civil is above all always rooted in its commitment to be a marketplace for sustainable journalism, where journalists are beholden to their readers above all else,\u201d Coolidge says.Rogue actors that want to sway challenges in their favor by buying up a bunch of tokens \u2014 like, say, a group of alt-right readers who invest a bunch of money to discount credible news sources they disagree with \u2014 would be easy to spot. Huge sums of tokens changing hand could trigger an alert. And thanks to Civil\u2019s extremely rigorous and lengthy registration process\u2014 multiple journalists have already failed their entry quiz already \u2014 Civil would already have each community member\u2019s information, making the rogue actors quickly identifiable.If this works the way Civil thinks it might, everyone wins: journalists and newsrooms would be able to support themselves and move away from a business model that relies on capricious ad revenue; readers can have confidence in what they read because they\u2019ve voted with their wallets to support only the good stuff.Civil is also planning to give newsrooms the ability to send every piece of content to its Ethereum-based blockchain, making any existing news content near impossible to tamper with, effectively ending any form of censorship. And we already have proof that blockchain can actually stop censorship: Chinese internet users managed to circumvent their government\u2019s strong-handed censorship practices by adding an investigative piece about a vaccine maker inside the metadata of a blockchain transaction.But whether the Civil platform will actually catch on is practically impossible to tell at this point.On August 13, Civil will launch 100 million CVL tokens as part of its token launch. It will reserve 33 percent of those tokens for itself; another third it will give out as grants to \u201cmission-aligned third parties\u201d (more details will emerge as we near the token launch, Civil has assured me). The remaining  34 percent it intends to sell. If it does, their total value won\u2019t exceed $32 million (this is called a hard cap \u2014 the fixed number of coins that will be issued also determines the value of each token).Some who already established businesses on the platform are frustrated with this. Too high of a hard cap, and a token\u2019s value would be diluted; too low and the token launch may have trouble getting off the ground. And Civil decided to set that bar relatively low. Realistically, even if the tokens reach their absolute highest value, they wouldn\u2019t be able to support entire newsroom operations immediately; depending on how the ICO goes, a single token will only be worth 24 to 94 cents.Newsrooms and journalists will feel the heat. Even thousands of tokens wouldn\u2019t be enough to pay a single journalist\u2019s salary. So for now, they will have to finance their operations the old fashioned way, instead of relying entirely on Civil\u2019s cryptoeconomy.As part of their podcast ZigZag, veteran journalist Manoush Zomrodi and radio producer Jen Poyant started creating a media business on Civil\u2019s platform. And the duo is not all that excited about the ICO.\u201cNot that we\u2019re going to get Lambos, you and I. But the money we could have gotten out of this sale [Civil\u2019s token launch] would fund our business the way a venture capitalist may have done,\u201d says Jen Poyant in Chapter 7: A New Frontier for Journalism?. \u201cBut that\u2019s definitely not going to happen.\u201d Instead, they will still have to rely on conventional venture capital to support their business, not just CVL tokens.By launching its token at such a bargain basement rate, Civil seems to be insulating its token from speculation, to ensure its value doesn\u2019t oscillate as bitcoin\u2019s has in the past. \u201cCVL is meant to play a critical utility in the ongoing self-governance of the platform, not to be a speculative vehicle of any kind,\u201d Coolidge says. In other words, Civil\u2019s token is there to act as a vote, or a way for you to keep unethical news off the platform \u2014 specifically not a get-rich-quick scheme.\u201cCVL is\u2026 not [meant] to be a speculative vehicle of any kind.\u201dSince no one one is going to make beaucoup bucks from the token launch, fiat currencies are still essential for everything to work, at least for the time being. \u201cThe forthcoming CVL token will unlock a lot of additional community features, but many Civil-newsroom contributing writers, editors, and illustrators are currently being compensated for their work in fiat currency,\u201d David Moore, the founder of Sludge, one of the first newsrooms to be built on Civil\u2019s platform, tells Futurism. But he is hopeful about creating incentives for freelancers by paying them in Civil tokens.There are, of course, a lot of questions about how Civil will work that are still impossible to answer. What will a Civil-powered comments section actually look like? Will journalists ever be remunerated entirely in tokens, or will they have to rely on income through conventional means? Will readers\u2019 ability to exert such a direct influence on the kind of news they read create healthy conversation with lots of opposing viewpoints, or create an echo-chamber just for one?Civil\u2019s mission is an optimistic one, perhaps fatally so. Is its convoluted tactic the only way to solve journalism for good? No, and Civil Foundation CEO Vivian Schiller agrees. She tells Zomrodi and Poyant on Chapter 7 of ZigZag: \u201cIs Civil going to be the answer to all the problems of journalism? Of course not. It doesn\u2019t have to be the answer to all the problems. It has to be a part of the answer, part of the solution.\u201d", "id": "459"}
{"content": "July 29--(CLICK HERE, if you are unable to view this photo gallery on your mobile device.)The relentless Carr Fire burning in Shasta County continued to grow Sunday, having already taken the lives of six people, including two firefighters, and forcing the evacuation of some 38,000 more, as it consumed nearly 90,000 acres.Fire officials Sunday confirmed a sixth death in the Carr Fire, and said a second firefighter died Sunday elsewhere in Northern California while battling the Ferguson Fire near Yosemite National Park.Barbara and Jason Richards, whose retirement home is outside Lewiston in Trinity County, watched from their porch Sunday as smoke from the Carr Fire continued to fill the sky. An evacuation advisory sent many of their neighbors from their homes, emptying the surrounding area and turning their small mountain community into a ghost town.But, with three adult dogs and three six-week-old puppies in tow, the Richards were waiting for the advisory to become mandatory. The Carr Fire has already burned 89,194 acres, destroyed 536 buildings, damaged 117 others and is threatening nearly 5,000 more. It remained only 5 percent contained as some 3,388 firefighters battled the blaze, Cal Fire officials said.Dozens of roadways remained closed Sunday, though evacuation orders had been lifted in some areas, according to the Shasta County Sheriff's Office. For the Richards, the hardest part was knowing when to go.The power went out in the middle of the night, cutting both their internet and phone lines, and any means of communicating with the outside world. Luckily, their neighbor, Dave Wellock, came over in the mid-morning, bringing a rotary phone for them to use.\"The hardest part is being out of communication,\" Barbara Richards said as her husband sat on the porch with two neighbors and Jason's sister, who was visiting from New Mexico.But the Richards were ready. They'd packed two vehicles and a camper trailer with food and crates for the dogs, clothing for several days, Jason Richards' jewelry that he makes and sells, and gear to make meals -- the necessities giving way to mementos and keepsakes.\"Everything means something to us; it's our life,\" Jason Richards said. \"But, it's all just stuff.\"The Carr Fire, burning about 100 miles south of California's border with Oregon, has killed six people, including two children and a great-grandmother.The winds, high temperatures and dry vegetation still have the potential to fuel more fire growth, Cal Fire officials said. It's spread \"in all directions,\" making it one of the largest wildfires in the state at a time when there are more than two dozen fires raging across California, authorities said.The Ferguson fire near Yosemite National Park has so far consumed 53,646 acres and was at 30 percent containment on Sunday.The Ranch and River fires, which both began in Mendocino County on Friday, have crossed into Lake County.Firefighters dubbed the two fires as the Mendocino Complex fires and said that they have torn through 24,270 acres combined, burned four homes and were threatening more than 4,500 buildings in Mendocino and Lake counties on Sunday with containment at 10 percent.Terrifying lessons from the Wine Country fires -- How to prepare for a wildfire in your neighborhood (Video).In Napa County, the Steele Fire was burning Sunday just south of Lake Berryessa, having consumed 150 acres since it started Saturday afternoon near Arroyo Grande Drive and Steele Canyon Road. It has destroyed seven structures, damaged one, and was forcing evacuations. However, by Sunday morning, Cal Fire reported it was 50 percent contained.Wellock, who has lived in Northern California his whole life, has never seen a fire as aggressive and fast-moving as the Carr Fire. He used to help firefighters when wildfires whipped through the area and said he knows every road and water source around.\"It is so big,\" he said. But he won't leave anywhere yet.Like the Richards, he's watching where the winds take the fire, and he's waiting.Check back for updates.___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "460"}
{"content": "July 29--On a Thursday afternoon, Madison Beer is taking a break from a photo shoot in downtown Hollywood. \"It's the least glamorous place in the world,\" she sighs. Given her 11 million Instagram followers and the constant barrage of paparazzi headlines (\"Madison Beer Flaunts Her Legs!\" and \"Madison Beer Bares Her Midriff!\"), you'd think Beer was a model, bored by routine photo shoots.But Beer is a singer who's been working her Fendi-clad butt off. She moved to California -- her family stayed in New York -- at age 13 to pursue a singing career after Justin Bieber posted a video of her singing on Twitter. The pop star helped get her signed to Island Records, his label at the time. After parting ways with Island in 2015, Beer independently released her debut EP \"As She Pleases\" in February through Access Records. The seven-track release mixes acoustic pop with R&amp;B. It's a raised middle finger to the labels who thought the 19-year-old couldn't release her own music, the boys who think she's coming home with them, mean girls. The EP's single \"Home With You,\" currently sits at No. 27 on Billboard's Top 40 charts, and her 30-city international \"As She Pleases\" tour sold out. We caught up with Beer, who has attended Lollapalooza, before she makes her debut at the festival.Q: How do you feel about returning to Lollapalooza as a performer instead of an attendee?A: I love festivals. I've been lucky enough to go to Lolla twice, and perform with Mako on the Lolla stage during their set in 2015 (for their song, \"I Won't Let You Walk Away\"). But I'm still nervous! Having my own set time is great, it's a cool switch. As someone who attends a lot of festivals, I think I can relate to festivalgoers and give them the energy they want during the set.Q: The songs on \"As She Pleases\" are more intimate -- and the tracklist is pretty short -- so how will you scale up your show for Lollapalooza?A: People can expect a few covers and old singles, similar to my tour shows. Except, very unlike my headlining tour, I know not everyone in the crowd is going to be my fan, so I hope I attract those people, too. But I'm not going to change much from my tour show, just spice it up, maybe with some new covers -- I'd never compromise myself or my music just to please a crowd.Q: As a musician, how do you feel when news coverage just focuses on your appearance, or your outfits?A: It's ... kind of aggravating when I wear a shirt that shows some cleavage and it becomes a news story; meanwhile, guys walk down the street with no shirt on, and no one says anything. Paparazzi will be like \"Look! She just turned 18 and she's already acting like this!\" It's like, give me a break! I have more to offer than my face and boobs. If something happened to my face, I hope people would have the same love and respect for me otherwise.Q: How has your social media following helped your career? Do the thousands of fan accounts ever feel overwhelming? Do you feel pressure to project a certain image on Instagram, Twitter for your fans?A: No, the only reason I'm able to be successful independently is because of my fan base and how supportive of me they are. \"Home With You\" is 27 on the Billboard charts, like it's crazy! I'm just grateful people are recognizing that I'm doing this independently. Times have changed in the industry. With social media, you can do it on your own, how you please. With image ... I wanna be a role model, I'm not out here posting a-- shots. On my stories and live streams, I try not to wear makeup or look like a million bucks, but just be genuine and act goofy. I don't want people to think beauty is everything, but that you should have a good heart and be a good person too.Q: So what's next for you after Lollapalooza, when you finally catch a break from touring?A: Straight to the studio. I'm working on my next album already, I've been sporadically at studio sessions near my house (in Beverly Hills). Music is my escape from it all, it's where I'm most comfortable ... happy.msmith@chicagotribune.comWhen: 6:50 p.m. ThursdayWhere: BMI Stage at Lollapalooza, Grant Park, 337 E.

{"content": "Aug. 01--A correction has been appended at the end of this story.SAN JOSE -- Google has bought a big house near the SAP Center, in a deal that suggests a widening area of interest for the search giant as it pushes ahead with a proposed transit village in downtown San Jose.Mountain View-based Google, acting through a realty venture named TC Agoge Associates, paid $960,000 in cash for a large residence at 160 N. Montgomery St. that's right across the street from the parking lots for the SAP entertainment and sports complex, according to Santa Clara County property documents filed on July 31. TC Agoge paid cash for the house, county files show. The sale price is below the $1.1 million that the home-valuation service Zillow suggests the house might have been worth to a retail buyer based on its size and recent nearby sales.In April, TC Agoge bought a commercial site at 240 and 250 N. Montgomery St., the long-time location of Frank Joseph's Automotive, a vehicle repair site a few doors away from this week's purchase.Directly, or through the TC Agoge joint venture that Google operates with veteran developer Trammell Crow, the technology company has spent at least $234 million to purchase an array of properties on the western edges of downtown San Jose in the Diridon train station area.Google is planning a transit-oriented community in downtown San Jose where 15,000 to 20,000 of its employees would eventually work in a development that consists of office buildings, residences, shops, restaurants, open spaces and other amenities, such as a cultural loop and eco walk.------CorrectionAugust 1, 2018An earlier version of this article incorrectly suggested that the sale price represented a significant increase in local property values.

They announced his release Saturday.May was a third-round Sox draft pick in 2013 and is the grandson of Lee May, who hit 20 or more home runs in 11 consecutive seasons.tgreenstein@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "463"}
{"content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 If you\u2019re in the seven- or eight-figure income bracket (or, heck, even the high-sixes), the report on the Trump administration looking at tax breaks for capital gains is very good news indeed.  But if you\u2019re a working stiff, then it\u2019s just another day at the office or shop floor.  Southwestern Connecticut has plenty of both kinds \u2014 and a lot in between as well. Fairfield County, for instance, is known for having a Grand Canyon-sized income gap \u2014 the \u201cepicenter of American inequality,\u201d as \u201cThe Atlantic\u201d once put it.  So what does the lawmaker who represents them all think of this idea?  Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., certainly has feet in both camps. He has the Goldman Sachs background, to be sure. And lord knows his constituency includes a fair number of veteran coupon-clippers.                              But he also has the \u201cdo-gooder\u201d box checked off as the Spanish-speaking son of aid workers in Peru and Columbia. And he worked on housing at a New York City non-profit before running for Congress. So there\u2019s plenty of constituents at the low end of the income spectrum who need representation too.  \u201cThe preferable treatment that capital gains receive under tax law already disproportionately benefits the very wealthy,\u201d said Himes in a statement. \u201cThese proposed changes, allowing individuals to adjust costs to account for inflation, would mean billions more in tax breaks, not for working Americans whose money comes from wages, but for the investor class.\u201d    Take that, Greenwich and Westport!  At this point, the capital gains cut is just an idea percolating in the mind of Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin. It\u2019s another facet of the long-held \u201ctrickle down\u201d belief among Republicans. Whether it sees the light of day is very much in doubt.  But it is definitely good to know Himes\u2019 answer to the query posed in the old-time union anthem: \u201cWhich side are you on?\u201d  ===============  Full disclosure: The press of deadlines and an impending office move here in D.C. prevented me from getting over to the tax-fraud trial of New Britain\u2019s own Paul Manafort at the federal courthouse in Alexandria, Va.  But I\u2019ve covered a few major trials in my days here in DC. So with the help of various news outlets and sources (including a close friend and fellow journalist covering the trial), I managed to cobble together some impressions from afar.  We know that \u201cRussia,\u201d \u201cTrump,\u201d \u201cMueller\u201d or \u201ccollusion\u201d are hardly mentioned in the ninth floor courtroom in Alexandria, a classic row-house community just across the Potomac from D.C. (Still has a Confederate-soldier memorial statue.)  Manafort\u2019s defense attorney, Thomas Zehnle, did his best to paint Manafort as a self-made success, \u201ca second-generation immigrant, the first in his family to go to college.\u201d  No mention, of course, of the senior Paul Manafort\u2019s political dominance in New Britain as Republican mayor from 1965 to 1971, nor Manafort Brothers Construction\u2019s immigrant founder, James Manafort, who established the New Britain House Wrecking Company (now Manafort Brothers construction) in 1919.  The crusty judge, T.S. Ellis III, wants to keep things rolling along in what promises to be a multi-week trial. On Day One, he admonished the prosecutor that being wealthy and spending a lot is not a crime.  That\u2019s too bad for the prosecution because a lot of the jury-appeal for their case rests on the parade of witnesses testifying about luxurious car and clothing purchases, all paid for by sketchy wire transfers from foreign bank accounts.  For the press, it\u2019s a retro-1980s atmosphere with no laptops and no phones allowed in the courtroom. The caf\u00e9 across the plaza is charging $4 a day for reporters to stow their stuff for the day. Such a windfall!  The Washington Post reported that during the prosecution\u2019s opening statement, the 12 jurors appeared riveted \u2014 with several taking notes. When the defense took its turn, jurors who had taken notes no longer were scribbling.  And a few appeared to nod off a bit. So for Manafort, 69, it\u2019s not breath-holding time. But the trial has far to go so the jury is still out, so to speak.  dan@hearstdc.com", "id": "464"}

{"content": "July 26--The ACLU of Northern California ran a test on Amazon's facial-recognition system and found something disturbing: It falsely matched the faces of 28 members of Congress with the mugshots of people who have been arrested.After releasing the results of its report Thursday, the ACLU reiterated its call for a moratorium on government use of facial recognition.\"Congress should press for a federal moratorium on the use of face surveillance until its harms, particularly to vulnerable communities, are fully considered,\" said Neema Singh Guliani, ACLU legislative counsel, in a statement. \"The public deserves a full debate about how and if face surveillance should be used.\"The ACLU noted that its test also showed that \"Congressional members of color were disproportionately identified incorrectly, including six members of the Congressional Black Caucus,\" among them civil rights leader Rep. John Lewis, D-Georgia.Another of the lawmakers whose face was mismatched by Amazon's system was one from the Bay Area: Rep. Mark DeSaulnier, D-Concord. Thursday, he and Sen. Ed Markey, D-Massachusetts, and Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Illinois, who were also misidentified, sent a letter to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, asking him to provide details about law enforcement's use of Rekognition, among other things.\"Amazon must slow down and consider not just its profit margin, but the impact on society that this technology will have,\" DeSaulnier said in an email statement to this news organization Thursday.Amazon has been facing other resistance against Rekognition, its facial-recognition software, including from its own employees. In June, Gizmodo reported that Amazon workers sent a letter to Bezos, urging him to stop selling facial recognition to law enforcement, among other things. Amazon shareholders also asked Bezos the same thing, saying, \"such government surveillance infrastructure technology may not only pose a privacy threat to customers and other stakeholders across the country, but may also raise substantial risks for our company, negatively impacting our company's stock valuation and increasing financial risk for shareholders.\"Despite the controversy, \"We remain excited about how image and video analysis can be a driver for good in the world, including in the public sector and law enforcement,\" an Amazon Web Services spokeswoman said Thursday.She added that ACLU's test did not set the confidence threshold -- the likelihood that the system found a match -- high enough.\"While 80% confidence is an acceptable threshold for photos of hot dogs, chairs, animals, or other social media use cases, it wouldn't be appropriate for identifying individuals with a reasonable level of certainty,\" she said. \"When using facial recognition for law enforcement activities, we guide customers to set a threshold of at least 95% or higher.\"In response, the ACLU pointed out Thursday that Amazon sets 80 percent confidence as Rekognition's default threshold, and that the company's own website shows the company \"is recommending\" an 80 percent confidence score in 'Face-Based User Verification.' \"As for the ACLU's point about bias in facial recognition, especially when it comes to people with darker skin, it's a common knock against the technology -- and one that is being addressed by Microsoft and IBM, they announced recently.\"Face surveillance will be used to power discriminatory surveillance and policing that targets communities of color, immigrants, and activists,\" said Jacob Snow, technology and civil liberties attorney at the ACLU of Northern California, in a statement. \"Once unleashed, that damage can't be undone.\"In addition, Microsoft President Brad Smith last month called for regulation of facial recognition, saying tech companies can't regulate themselves on this issue, and especially if government is using the technology for various purposes.___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "467"}
{"content": "Aug. 01--Chicago Public Schools officials are digging out from another Barbara Byrd-Bennett scandal, three years after the former CPS CEO departed the district in disgrace.In short: Gary Solomon and Thomas Vranas, two now-imprisoned Byrd-Bennett cronies, allegedly pocketed $294,000 to help Camelot Education open several CPS campuses, according to the district's inspector general, Nicholas Schuler. He says the company also hired a former high-ranking CPS administrator -- an official who had resigned from the district during an internal misconduct investigation -- \"as part of a 'wink-wink' agreement that Solomon brokered on Byrd-Bennett's behalf.\" Camelot has received more than $67 million in CPS business, Schuler says.Please note this case is separate from the kickback scandal that landed Byrd-Bennett, Solomon and Vranas in prison.This Camelot report at first may seem like ancient history; most of the alleged misconduct happened between 2012 and 2014. But if the IG's findings are accurate, then Camelot opened several alternative schools to serve dropouts not by bidding fairly, but by corruptly paying for influence.This IG report is another terrible stain on Chicago Board of Education oversight and the district's problem-plagued procurement process. If most of the district's board members from this era hadn't already stepped down, we'd be calling for all of them to resign now.What should happen now that Schuler has alerted Chicagoans? The district has started a punitive process that likely will end either in a negotiated settlement or in shuttering Camelot's schools and barring the company from doing business in Chicago again. Camelot disputes Schuler's findings. \"We competed for and won the Board of Education's contract fairly and on our merits,\" Camelot CEO Andrew Morrison says.Schuler's top recommendation: Zero tolerance for corruption. That sounds right to us, especially since two top executives allegedly involved in the CPS case remain at Camelot, Schuler says.Eradicating Camelot from Chicago will have to be done carefully. Camelot operates several high-performing alternative schools in the district. These schools serve many students who have dropped out of, or been expelled from, traditional schools. We've met some of these students and heard about their struggles with personal and family demons. Reaching these teens with the right instruction and counseling, and helping them graduate, is a feat.CPS says state law would prohibit Camelot school closures at least until August 2019. Fair enough -- that gives CPS time to plan for a seamless transition to one or more honest operators.Closing schools and transferring students elsewhere risks disrupting these students' education yet again. But other high-quality contractors would eagerly bid for the chance to run schools in Chicago. CPS should open the bidding and give everyone a chance to educate these students.That's our top recommendation, and Schuler's as well. If closing those schools would prove too disruptive, Schuler recommends a lesser punishment: Fine Camelot at least $6.7 million -- one-tenth of its Chicago revenue -- and appoint an independent monitor to track the company over the next three years.If Schuler's allegations are true, then fining and monitoring this company aren't enough. Camelot allegedly cheated to get CPS' business. Children learn that cheating brings punishment. The Chicago Board of Education should end Camelot's reign in Chicago.___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "468"}
{"content": "July 25--Big Ten media days are in the rearview. Fall camps open late next week. Here are five takeaways from the conference's annual gathering in Chicago:Prepare the can of wormsBig Ten coaches haven't exactly embraced the idea of submitting names for a weekly player availability/injury report. But none was outwardly opposed. Even Michigan's Jim Harbaugh, who has gone to comical lengths to hide his roster, said he would be \"fine with\" it.One reporter was dying for Ohio State defensive tackle Dre'Mont Jones to invoke privacy concerns, but Jones instead said: \"I am not opposed to disclosing my injury. If I have an injury, you can tell whoever you want.\"And that's the point. Because coaches have been free to lie or omit information about injuries, players get heat from friends and fellow students making wagers. An official injury report (a la the NFL) would theoretically get bettors off the backs of players.There are still major questions, including these: Would a player be listed as probable/questionable/doubtful, and would the injured body part be specified?And the biggest ones: Who is in charge of administering the list? The Big Ten? The NCAA? What's the penalty for subterfuge? Would schools have to specify if a player is suspended -- and for what infraction?Many coaches would rather dip their legs into boiling lava than deal with this. But Commissioner Jim Delany left little doubt it will happen, saying, \"It's something we should have done before and certainly should do now.\"Nothing bothers the BadgersWisconsin coach Paul Chryst didn't take the bait on a question about the relative weakness of the Big Ten West, saying, \"I don't spend a lot of time trying to figure out narratives.\"Another narrative is that Wisconsin is a mortal lock to win the Big Ten West. Asked if his crew feels like the team to beat, safety D'Cota Dixon replied: \"I don't care. Whoever is on the schedule, get out the way. I just think of it like: Line up. Play football. Whoever's in front of me, beat 'em.\"That sounds like something Chryst would say.\"Does it?\" Dixon responded. \"That's a good thing then.\"Iowa's quarterback is quietAnd that's just fine with coach Kirk Ferentz, who said of Nate Stanley: \"He's not a loud guy, a look-at-me guy. Almost shuns that. But on the things that count, he is so solid. Mentally tough. He cares a lot about his performance -- and his teammates' performance. He cares about them as people. All the (qualities) that people respond to, he possesses them.\"Stanley is from small-town Wisconsin and sounds like he could be Steve Stricker's son. (The Wisconsin native has been ranked the nicest guy on the PGA Tour.) Stanley also excelled in basketball and baseball before taking the advice of his father, Jay, who pointed out that schools offer many more football scholarships than they do for other sports.At one point Tuesday, Stanley was asked a question that should have made him chuckle: Do you trash-talk on the field?\"Not a whole lot,\" he replied.Get used to an East and a WestAs long as Delany is commissioner, the conference will not try to manipulate the obvious imbalance of power.\"We've had two experiences with divisions,\" Delany said. \"The first one was based on competitive balance over the last 20 years. And to be honest with you, it wasn't received that well.\"That was Delany's diplomatic dissing of Legends and Leaders, which the public embraced as warmly as the kale burger. Delany can also point to how the SEC East once ruled the West, going 10-4 in conference title games from 1993 to 2006.If Nebraska returns to its Bob Devaney/Tom Osborne form and if Jeff Brohm can be the second coming of Joe Tiller at Purdue, the complaints will go away. Two big ifs.There's intrigue at Ohio State and MichiganWith J.T. Barrett having left Columbus and Shea Patterson having moved to Ann Arbor, there's quarterback uncertainty in the land of Woody and Bo. Ohio State could very well have the best tandem in the conference in Dwayne Haskins and Tate Martell, a new version of Chris Leak and Tim Tebow, who shared time for Urban Meyer's 2006 national champions at Florida.\"Dwayne has a high ceiling and can launch the ball 100 yards off the knees,\" said Jones, the Ohio State lineman. \"He kind of reminds me of Cardale (Jones), but he's not as goofy. Tate is super-fast but needs to get a little stronger, like everyone else.\"Michigan insiders believe Patterson, who transferred from Ole Miss, is a cinch to win the starting job over Brandon Peters, who was at the helm last season for wins over Rutgers, Minnesota and Maryland -- and losses to Ohio State and South Carolina. Also potentially in the mix are redshirt freshman Dylan McCaffrey (Christian's taller brother) and true freshman Joe Milton.tgreenstein@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "469"}

{"content": "Aug. 04--Things were going so well for Lucas Giolito and the White Sox.Zeroes on the scoreboard. Brilliant defensive plays. Timely hitting.And then, in the eighth inning, things stopped going well for Giolito and the Sox.Rays shortstop Daniel Robertson grounded sharply up the middle, hustling into second. That initiated a chain reaction that started with Giolito being pulled (99 pitches), manager Rick Renteria summoning three relievers and the Rays tying the game on a suicide squeeze.But the rally died and the Sox retook the lead for good in the 10th, emerging with a 3-2 victory.Yoan Moncada, hitting just .167 from the right side, lined Jose Alvarado's knee-high fastball over the left fielder's head to score pinch-runner Adam Engel. Engel replaced Nicky Delmonico, who hustled into second on a line drive to right.\"I went to swing in that at-bat,\" Moncada said. \"That was the mindset. I had a very good pitch and I made good contact.\"It was a nice victory for the Sox, who improved to 3-3 in extra-inning games. The organization is looking for Moncada and Giolito to emerge as standouts in their rebuild.Giolito was cruising along until Robertson's double. He had allowed just two hits and three walks over seven innings, striking out six.Jose Abreu made two dynamite plays at first, making a rolling stop of a Ji-Man Choi in the fifth and a diving stab of a Michael Perez grounder in the sixth.The Sox employed a shift for nearly every left-handed Rays hitter. That paid off, too.But Renteria just couldn't wait to use the Sox bullpen, which entered with a 4.70 ERA -- ranking 25th in the AL.Jace Fry gave up what looked like a routine grounder, but this time the shift backfired. Third baseman Yolmer Sanchez was playing closer to shortstop and could not make the diving play.The run was charged to Giolito, but at least he was able to get his ERA below 6.00 -- its lowest since April 12 -- to 5.97.Renteria said he pulled Giolito at 99 pitches because he felt the right-hander was tiring.\"He gave us a great outing. Why put him in a situation where he gets into more trouble,\" Renteria said. \"You might say: That's his game to win. But he did a great job for us as a team.\"And at least he lasted longer than the Rays' starter. Not that it was his fault.Right-hander Ryne Stanek faced five Sox batters -- and struck out each one. But he's a reliever. The Rays have few bona fide starting pitchers, so they're trying something new -- relievers as starters.Abreu hit his 18th homer for the Sox, a two-run blast on a 1-1 breaking ball from Jaime Schultz in the sixth. That's all the Sox got until the 10th. But that third run came just in time.Tyler Danish, pitching 45 minutes from where he grew up, helped kill a Rays rally in the ninth by striking out Jesus Sucre. He earned the victory.\"What more could I ask for?\" Danish said. \"It's an amazing feeling. And my phone is kind of blowing up right now.\"tgreenstein@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "471"}

Unfortunately for fans of Rick Grimes, this ninth season will indeed be his last, confirmed by the man himself at San Diego Comic-Con.During a recent interview with EW Radio, Lincoln finally explained his reason for leaving the show. It was a decision he didn\u2019t reach easily, as was apparent during his somber SDCC appearance and the emotional embrace he received from his castmates.Completing the show was like releasing air finally. And it was very satisfying the last two episodes in particular. But doing a panel and having to talk to [thousands of] people in Hall H and then have all my friends hug me at the end?

It was that simple. It was time for me to come home.Walking Dead shoots for half a year or more in Georgia. Lincoln\u2019s wife Gael and two children, Mathilda and Arthur, have lived in Atlanta during that time frame, returning to their countryside home of Wiltshire when all is done. We can imagine Lincoln will be happy to have more family time and return to English weather. In 2014, he joked with The Telegraph about missing seasons, swapping English summers for Atlanta\u2019s \u201csweatbox\u201d of a summer.Lincoln did offer some season 9 details for fans, saying that survivors will have to deal with a deteriorating world.Food is scarce, the Hilltop\u2019s the main sort of food source, communications are breaking down, we don\u2019t have gas anymore and we\u2019re on horseback, and we\u2019ve run out of bullets. So there is an enormous pressure on this group.Lincoln says his character Rick knows there\u2019s a \u201clong game\u201d ahead. Communities need to find a way to work together, despite old grievances, or else things are \u201cgoing to fall apart.\u201d He added that a \u201cfellow band of warriors\u201d appears just as things are getting rocky, and there will be a \u201cfragile peace\u201d everyone will have to deal with.With a terrifying new enemy on the horizon \u2014 The Whisperers \u2014 fragility is not exactly something any of these communities need right now.

{"content": "July 26--(CLICK HERE, if you are unable to view this photo gallery or video on your mobile device.)First things, first. There is no Ernie.The owner of the lucky liquor store in East San Jose that sold Tuesday's winning ticket for the $543 million Mega Millions jackpot is named Kewal Sachdev. Not Ernie.Yes, his store still bears the name of a previous owner -- Ernie's Liquors -- and so did the giant ceremonial check that lottery officials presented to Sachdev and his family on Wednesday morning. The sign out front of Ernie's omits the apostrophe, giving the impression that there are more than one.But make no mistake, Sachdev's store on the corner of White and Quimby roads was the only place in 44 states, Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Virgin Islands to sell a winning ticket for the third-largest jackpot in Mega Millions history.While San Jose's newest millionaire remained a mystery Wednesday morning, the buzz around Ernie's Liquors has not let up since the night manager woke Sachdev from a nap Tuesday night to alert him to his good fortune: Not only does the jackpot winner get to claim a check with a mind-boggling number of zeros -- $320.5 million before taxes, if she takes the lump-sum payoff -- but the merchant who sold the ticket gets his own check for $1 million.The winning numbers: 1-2-4-19-29 -- Megaball 20.Now, Sachdev's phone has not stopped ringing. Everyone is calling to congratulate him, telling him that 18 years of hard work at the liquor store had finally paid off. This is a family business, where Sachdev's wife, Kiran, opens the store every morning at 8:30 to sell beer, cigarettes and lottery tickets to the regulars and others who stop in the strip mall for everything from masala to donuts to groceries at the Manila Oriental Market.Wednesday morning, business was considerably busier.\"The lucky one!\" Jerry Esterllado, a frequent customer, shouted as he walked in, grumbling to himself. \"I just missed the store,\" he said, explaining that he bought his tickets Tuesday night at the nearby gas station, not Ernie's.Imelda and Bonni Rillera, visiting family here from Virginia, bought their tickets right here -- and when their daughter heard this is where the winner was sold, well, the couple almost lost it. They scrambled to find their ticket.\"We were searching the house, screaming,\" says Imelda, 69, who finally found the ticket in her purse.When they checked the numbers, their blood pressure rose even higher when they discovered one, two, three of the numbers -- plus the Mega number -- were staring them in the face. Insanely close, but still worth $200.Even Sachdev, 65, acknowledges he bought a ticket for last night's drawing. While he can only speculate who the mystery winner is, he's got his hunch after reviewing his security camera's surveillance footage. He thinks he's narrowed it down to a man in his mid-40s who bought one of the $2,260 in tickets on Monday. Sachdev described him as one the regulars but doesn't know his name.\"I can't quite picture his face now,\" Sachdev said, \"but if I saw him again, I would know it was him.\"Lottery officials advise winners of big jackpots to consult financial advisers and attorneys before claiming their prize, which usually means anticipation grows for days to learn the winner's identityThis marks the second time a San Jose store has sold a winning Mega Millions ticket with a monster jackpot. In December 2013, a gift shop on Tully Road sold one of two winning tickets for a $656 million jackpot. In that case, the winner, identified only as Steve Tran of Northern California, waited about three weeks before stepping forward to claim $173.8 million, before taxes.So be patient. The Sachdevs sure have been. Amol Sachdev, 22, said his father thought it was a hoax when he woke him Tuesday night to tell him a television station wanted to interview him. Not until he called back the reporter did he realize how his life -- and Ernie's Liquors -- were about to change. The elder Sachdev said he's planning to use his share of the jackpot to help his three children pay off their student loans, fix up the store and donate some to charity.As the Sachdevs stood Wednesday morning in front of a bank of television cameras outside Ernie's with lottery officials holding their ginormous check, he proudly reflected on his good fortune since moving from India nearly four decades ago.\"We've realized the dream that we longed for,\" he said. \"If you work hard, you can succeed -- this country has given us the opportunity to do that.\"___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "474"}
{"content": "Aug. 01--Paul Konerko is making a long list of topics he wants to cover when he joins Hawk Harrelson for an upcoming White Sox broadcast.\"It might be the only game ever that I hope goes to extra innings,\" Konerko said Tuesday during a visit to Guaranteed Rate Field before the Sox's game against the Royals. \"It'll be awesome.\"I haven't seen Hawk in a while. I'm going to try to cram as much as I can in. I'll say it now -- forgive me if I go off on some tangents that have nothing to do with what's going on on the field.\"Konerko spent the last 16 years of his career with the Sox, retiring after the 2014 season. He loves Harrelson's passion for the game and huge personality.\"When I think of Hawk, I just think of how on almost a daily basis there was conversation about Hawk on that left-field line (during) stretching or sitting in the dugout during a game: 'I wonder what Hawk said about that one?' \" Konerko said. \"It was always (something), so yeah, it's kind of an end of an era, a big long era. I don't think guys are going to get to do it as long as he has done it, and I don't think guys will be allowed to be like he is anymore, right?\"Konerko said his only goal for that Aug. 19 telecast with the Royals back in town is to avoid being fined by the FCC for saying something inappropriate.Quiet deadline: Sox general manager Rick Hahn didn't have much to say to reporters after the trade deadline passed Tuesday, but he did say in a text that he was tired.The deadline for non-waiver trades drains baseball executives, even if they're only monitoring the activity of other clubs most of the time. That appears to have been the case with the Sox, who long ago indicated they didn't expect to trade either of their two biggest chips, Avisail Garcia and Jose Abreu.One could imagine the situation being different a year from now if Garcia and Abreu have remained unsigned beyond 2019. Hahn is content to let their situations play out over time, with the offseason perhaps the most logical place to extend their contracts -- believed to be a significant possibility with Abreu at least -- or trade them.Extra innings: The Sox did make a small transaction Tuesday, acquiring Class A left-handed reliever Hunter Schryver from the Rays for international signing bonus pool money. He was a seventh-round pick in the 2017 draft from Villanova. ... Omar Narvaez is becoming James Shields' personal catcher. He worked with Shields for an eighth consecutive start even though Kevan Smith normally starts against left-handed pitchers. ... The Royals arrived without Mike Moustakas, whom they traded to the Brewers last Friday. He has hit 20 home runs versus the Sox, his most against any opponent.___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "475"}
{"content": "Aug. 04--SAN FRANCISCO -- The Giants second baseman hit solo home runs in each of the first two games, providing the only offense for the club as it became the first team to open a season with back-to-back 1-0 victories.Though Panik appeared poised for a career year in March, injuries have taken a toll on his effectiveness and his average has plummeted to .235. While he's been a regular starter since he joined the Giants back in 2014, Panik is now being asked to platoon at second base with right-handed infielder Chase d'Arnaud.Giants manager Bruce Bochy penciled d'Arnaud into Friday's lineup against D'backs lefty Patrick Corbin and when asked whether he considers the current state of affairs at second base a platoon, Bochy said \"pretty much.\"\"This situation could change if Joe gets on a roll,\" Bochy said. \"That could change.\"A fractured thumb altered the course of Panik's season at the end of April, forcing him to miss a full month of action while fill-in Alen Hanson provided a spark with his impressive speed as Panik's replacement.Though Panik returned to the Giants June 1 and recorded at least two hits in his first three games off the disabled list, he hit .182 in his next 99 at-bats.On July 6, Panik suffered a groin strain running the bases against the Cardinals and needed another stint on the disabled list. Though the Giants wanted Panik to find his timing at the plate during a rehab assignment, Pablo Sandoval's season-ending hamstring injury left the club short on infield depth.The Giants cut Panik's rehab stint short, but since he flew in to San Diego to rejoin the club Tuesday, he has only started one game and that came against D'backs right-hander Zack Greinke. After Greinke was lifted Thursday, Bochy inserted d'Arnaud in as a substitute to hit against lefty reliever Jake Diekman.Bochy is hoping Panik seizes opportunities to regain his full-time starting role, but Bochy also knows he can't start Panik against lefties unless he finds a groove at the plate.\"They've taken a toll on his season with the time that he's missed,\" Bochy said of Panik's injuries. \"He did get off to a great start but he had a couple of pretty big interruptions so that's going to play a part in your season.\"With Panik expected to play against righties and d'Arnaud starting most games against lefties, Hanson will continue in his current bench role and provide coverage at a variety of positions.Hanson is 8-for-14 as a pinch hitter this season and delivered an RBI single a five-run eighth inning for the Giants Thursday.\"I like having him coming off the bench,\" Bochy said. \"He has pretty good numbers there, he gives you speed, there's a few positions I can double switch with him. He gives you value there.\"Panik is hitting .165 in 79 at-bats against left-handers this year while d'Arnaud is 11-for-29 (.379) with three home runs against left-handers since he joined the Giants July 8.___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "476"}
{"content": "Aug. 02--When she heard about The Big Latch On, Jenny LeFlore knew she needed to get involved. The global event takes place at registered locations where women come together to breastfeed in unison and offer one another peer support to celebrate the beginning of Breastfeeding Awareness Month.The founder of local motherhood community Mama Fresh, LeFlore is planning one such gathering 9:30 a.m. Sunday at Build Coffee in Woodlawn. She calls the event a \"breastfeeding sit-in.\"\"It was so important to me this year because of all of the fire that really has gone on with women and breastfeeding,\" the 37-year-old Bronzeville resident said. \"In the news, with Utah and Idaho just making it legal in the last two weeks, and then locally, with the woman in Chicago who was there to serve jury duty and being denied access to a lactation room. This was something where I felt like, 'You know what? I have to be a part of it.'\"In addition to seeking to normalize breastfeeding, the event fits within Mama Fresh's mission to create a diverse community of motherhood, particularly for women on the South Side. LeFlore cited a 2013 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report, explaining that \"black infants consistently had the lowest rates of breastfeeding initiation and duration.\" LeFlore sees lack of peer support as a major contributor to those problematic rates, but she's working to change that.\"The statistics find that it is all because of the lack of community to support each other in breastfeeding. That's why it's important to me for you to see other black women there, breastfeeding their little ones,\" she said.Last year, LeFlore organized a similar event with the lactation team at University of Chicago Medicine. However, she sees strategic value in holding this year's event in a community business like Build Coffee.\"I felt that it was important to have it in a comfortable and relaxing and everyday environment,\" LeFlore said. \"Because that truly normalizes it and takes away the stigma that it's something clinical that should be done in privacy or in a hospital.\"Bea Malsky, Build Coffee's bookshop and events manager, described the business as a kid-friendly shop that wants new parents to feel welcome, making a partnership with LeFlore's event an excellent fit.\"We're very glad for the chance to support Jenny in her work to make it safer, easier and more fun to be a mother in public, and to create spaces for young families to thrive,\" Malsky said.LeFlore loved Build Coffee's mission as \"a place for radical collaboration and experimentation,\" and she felt strongly about hosting the sit-in within her own community.\"Woodlawn and the neighborhoods around it -- Kenwood, Hyde Park, Bronzeville -- people can speak about it in a very monolithic way because it's majority African-American, but when you look at the other demographics in terms of education, economics, marital status, there's so much variety and culture right in this group of neighborhoods,\" LeFlore said. \"And it's so great that you can see longtime residents that have been here for generations and then residents who are choosing to move here. They might have lived in other parts of the city, and then they're choosing to come to this area to raise their families. And that's because of the cultural richness that we have in this area.\"laurenchval@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "477"}
{"content": "Aug. 03--Q: Who is the idiot that invented metering lights?M. R. PamidiSan JoseA: Idiot? He's Dolf May, a legend in the traffic world and one of my favorite interviews. Why are you so upset?Q: I think they make traffic flow worse. I remember last year when the metering lights on northbound Highway 101 past the San Jose airport were off and traffic moved smoothly. When they are on, traffic backs up almost half a mile south.A: Dolf was a traffic engineer in Illinois when he set up the first ramp meter in 1963 on the Eisenhower Expressway in Chicago. A traffic cop stood at an on-ramp with a hand-held light he would switch to red as cars approached. Dolf later became a professor at UC-Berkeley and moved to the Bay Area.Studies prove ramp meters work. A Minnesota review in 2000 involved shutting off all 433 ramp meters in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area for eight weeks to test their effectiveness. When the meters were turned off freeway capacity decreased by 9 percent, travel times increased by 22 percent, freeway speeds dropped by 7 percent and crashes increased by a staggering 26 percent.Closer to home, upset drivers pressed local officials to pressure Caltrans to speed up the meters on Highway 85 and the 25-mile drive from South San Jose to Mountain View. But travel time increased by 48 percent and drivers pleaded for the meters to be slowed down.Metering lights have reduced travel time by 19 minutes on a 10-mile stretch of Highway 101 in San Mateo County. Travel speeds on 101 between Bernal Road and Capitol Expressway moved at an average of 36 mph before metering, and 44 mph after. There are now nearly 560 active ramp meters in the Bay Area and the goal is 1,320 by 2025.Thanks to Dolf-the-Genius.Q: Jeff-the-Bridge-Man lacks imagination about the need of wind socks on the San Mateo Bridge. A wind sock indicates wind strength, obviously, and some drivers will be extra cautious in high wind, the same way that some drivers become more cautious in rain.John RuckstuhlCupertinoA: Oh-oh, another one of my-go-to-guys is getting slammed.Q: I think Jeff-the Bridge-Man missed the value of a windsock for wind speed on the San Mateo Bridge. If you see the windsock indicates high wind, a cautious driver might be inclined to slow down, not fiddle with the radio or not grab his cell phone (well, being California, the last bit might not be true). Maybe even keep both hands on the wheel.Dave KenyonSan JoseA: I'll pursue this with Caltrans.

{"content": "What a difference a year has made for Papa John's International Inc. (PZZA) .  The embattled pizza restaurant has seen its stock tank 45% over the past 12 months following the decision of former CEO and spokesperson John Schnatter to wade into the controversy surrounding the protest of some NFL players during the national anthem on an earnings call.  Those comments placed the company, which had a long-standing relationship with the pro football league, squarely in the middle of a cultural debate that has been raging for more than two years.  That decision is a prime example the dangers of having a living human being with thoughts and opinions as your spokesperson -- as opposed to a mascot or fictional character -- according to Jonathan Maze of foodservice industry trade paper Restaurant Business.  \"When you become a controversial figure it is nearly impossible to also be a spokesperson for a brand,\" Maze told TheStreet. \"In 2018, there are so many restaurant choices. Consumers don't have to patronize your business.\" Schnatter stepped down as CEO of the company he founded after admitting to using a racial slur during a conference call with a PR firm that was attempting to train him on how to be a better spokesperson.  Sales at Papa John's fell 16% during the second week of July, when John Schnatter's prosecution in the court of public opinion was at its height, according to data from Technomic's Transaction Insights.  That decline in sales was on top of the company's struggles in the wake of Schnatter's initial comments in 2017.  In the first quarter, Papa John's reported a 5.3% decline in same-store sales for the second consecutive quarter after several years of consistent growth for the company.  \"Papa John's has some fundamental strengths. If it can get past this controversy they have a lot of things going for it. People still love pizza,\" Maze said.  The fact that Schnatter is not going quietly surely isn't helping the company's stock price. But as the company gears up for its second-quarter earnings release next week, it's not all bad news for Papa John's.  \"It's still a good company, but using a spokesperson is a risky proposition in general. It's smart to tread lightly,\" Maze said.", "id": "480"}

{"content": "July 30--All-Star center Dwight Howard said signing with the Washington Wizards rather than pursuing an opportunity with the world champion Warriors was a no-brainer for him.Howard's mind was pretty much made up after he received a message from Wizards star point guard John Wall.\"Golden State called and I thought about them,\" said Howard, according to NBC Sports Washington. \"But once John sent me that message, I was like, man. I couldn't tell him at first, but I was like 'man, I'm going to be a Wizard.' That was my mindset.\"While Howard said he chose the Wizards over the Warriors, there are no indications the Warriors even made the 32-year-old an offer. More likely, Golden State was doing its due diligence while trying to decide which free agent it would target with its taxpayer's mid-level exception of $5.3 million.The Howard matter became moot for the Warriors once DeMarcus Cousins, a younger and much more talented big man, reached out to them. Besides, helping Cousins rehab his Achilles tendon was more appealing than trying to help repair Howard's reputation. Cousins wound up signing with the Warriors on July 2.The perception of Howard as a divisive force in the locker room has followed him through many of his NBA stops, including last season with Charlotte. He had a solid season on the court, averaging 16.6 points and 12.5 rebounds, but was dealt to Brooklyn on July 6 in a salary dump. The Nets then quickly waived him, giving Howard the chance to choose which team would be his seventh NBA home in 15 seasons.Wall's message made Howard realize quickly he'd found his new home.\"No lie, when I saw the message on Instagram, I really got so happy,\" Howard said. \"I was like 'John just DM'd me, oh man this is crazy!' After that, I really just started to put on my thinking cap.\"I just thought about all the possibilities. I was like 'man, this could be the best spot for me.' \"___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "482"}
{"content": "Aug. 02--Arzella \"Sally\" Moser is a retired banker in Hayward who said she should've known better than to be sucked in by a tech support scam.\"I used to be a signature expert,\" said Moser, 76. She helped to detect forgeries while working in the fraud division of what is now Chase bank.Yet she and others -- many of them elderly -- are among a large number of people targeted by companies pushing a growing scam: bogus tech support. Microsoft said it received 153,000 reports last year from customers who \"encountered or fell victim to tech support scams,\" a 24 percent rise from the prior year.Moser is among several Bay Area residents who recently shared their accounts of how they were targeted, while Microsoft and Mountain View-based cybersecurity firm Symantec described warning signs that a company or caller may not be on the level when offering online support services.Moser and many others became victims of a scam whose accused perpetrator ran Hayward-based Genius Technologies. Parmjit Singh Brar, operator of Genius, reached a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission in June. He must pay $136,000, although under the settlement he neither admits nor denies the allegations.The FTC accused Brar of working with telemarketers to trick elderly Americans into buying fake tech support services. The telemarketers claimed to be from well-known tech companies and told people their computers were at risk, the FTC said in a June press release. Those who allowed remote access were charged money to get outdated security software installed on their computers, and their personal information was stolen, the FTC said.The FTC settlement also bars Brar from operating tech support services again.Brar's attorney, Guyton Jinkerson, said he had no comment on the matter.It's unclear at this point whether Moser -- who was scammed out of more than $3,500 by a few different companies -- and other victims will get their money back. The FTC judgment was for $7.6 million, but it was partially suspended because of Brar's inability to pay the full amount, according to the FTC.\"We are evaluating whether a refund program is feasible in this case,\" said Juliana Gruenwald, an FTC spokeswoman.Moser recounted how it all started for her. She got a phone call one morning not long after logging onto her computer to find a message that she had been hacked.\"They told me there was a Russian spammer who attacked my system,\" she said. \"Then they asked, 'Do you do banking online? Hopefully they haven't gotten to your banking. Give us $300 and we can correct this for you.' \" After that first amount, which was charged to her credit card in 2015, her computer worked fine, she said.Then she said she was shaken down again in 2016, and a couple more times last year. In April 2017, she wrote a $1,918 check to Genius Technologies and sent it to a Newark address.A copy of her Genius Technologies paperwork shows that it even asked customers not to \"allow anyone to access your computer on a call you receive.\"Eventually, Moser said she used her age to her advantage, telling the callers that she didn't remember owing them money.Another company she paid has been reported to the FTC at least a few times, according to documents obtained by this news organization as part of a Freedom of Information Act request. The FTC was careful to note that it has not necessarily verified all the complaints. The email address and phone number the company provided to Moser are unreachable and appear to no longer be in service. This news organization is withholding the name of that company because the complaints are unverified.So, what should people do to avoid being scammed?\"If you think there's a problem with your computer, take it to a friend or take it to a computer repair shop,\" said Kevin Haley, director of product management for security response at Symantec. \"It's sort of like with your car. You have to find a mechanic you can trust.\"In addition, Symantec -- which owns Norton antivirus and other security software -- would never call a customer about a frozen computer, he said.\"Right there, 100 percent of those phone calls are scams,\" Haley said.The scams also take other forms: Last year, Symantec blocked 154 million phony messages suggesting a problem with users' computers.Louis Stephan of Concord, who's 83, said he got a message that appeared to be from Microsoft when his computer froze up.He called the number in the message and reached someone who offered him different tiers of \"protection\" for his computer. He said he eventually paid a total of $1,100 to EZFix Solution, at a San Diego address -- which turns out to be residential. But his story has a happy ending: He barely lost any money.\"I told them I would tell the FTC,\" Stephan said, when he asked for his money back. He said in the end, he only lost $35, the fee to put a stop payment on the check.This news organization placed multiple calls to EZFix Solution. The first time, a technician would not divulge any details, including where he was based. The second and third times, somebody promised to call back with information about Stephan's case but did not do so.Microsoft said in a recent blog post that it would \"never proactively reach out to you to provide unsolicited PC or technical support. Any communication we have with you must be initiated by you.\"Haley said scammers may not be \"content with stealing your money. They want to do other things as well.\" In some cases, thieves want to steal more information or use others' computers to mine cryptocurrency.Another Bay Area resident, Frank Cameron, said people who claimed to be Apple tech support asked him to buy thousands of dollars' worth of Google Play gift cards so they could fix viruses that were supposedly on his Mac. Over three days in May, the 81-year-old Los Altos resident went to Walgreens, CVS, Whole Foods and Safeway to buy the cards. He then scratched off the back of the gift cards to reveal their codes and scanned them into his computer. Cameron lost a total of $7,400.Since then, Cameron has refused to allow anyone to access his computer remotely. He said he is a retired electrical engineer who is \"pretty experienced with a computer.\"\"They were pros,\" he said. When they called, the caller ID showed \"Apple tech support\" but had no name or number, he said.Last fall, the Better Business Bureau warned against such scams, saying, \"Don't believe Caller ID.\"------TIPS ABOUT TECH SUPPORT SCAMS:* If you receive an unsolicited phone call or email about your computer, it is most likely a scam.* If you receive an unsolicited pop-up message on your computer, examine it closely and look for signs that it may be fake. They include misspellings and bad grammar, or poor-quality graphics and images.* Examine emails in the same way, because scammers may be trying to trick you into clicking on a link or opening a file.* Microsoft says its error messages and warnings never include a phone number.* Symantec, which makes Norton antivirus software, says it will call you only if you request a call.* Search online for the number you are asked to call. If other people have reported that number, it might come up as a suspected scam.* Search online for the address where you are asked to send a payment. If it is a house, you might want to think twice.* If you are tricked into giving someone remote access to your computer, change the passwords on your bank account and other accounts.* If you are scammed, contact your bank and the FTC, where you can file an online complaint. The Better Business Bureau also has a scam tracker.* Take notes and save paperwork, which could come in handy when you're filing a complaint.Source: Symantec, Microsoft, Mercury News research------___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "483"}

{"content": "July 25--OAKLAND -- A flight touched down here Wednesday morning with Kevin Durant's face and outstretched arms slathered across almost the entirety of the Boeing 737. It's part of a campaign by Alaska Airlines, which is using Durant's likeness on its fleet while helping to back the Warriors star's charity efforts.Athlete endorsements are nothing new, but this was a lot bigger than a Wheaties box. There is being on a plane and actually being on a plane. Once Durant de-boarded, I asked the NBA Finals MVP what it was like to see his face at that scale.\"All I could think about was how I grew up and where I came from,\" the Warriors star said, referring to his family's poverty in Seat Pleasant, Maryland. \"Nobody knew who I was. None of my friends would ever think this would happen to me. It's pretty dope to see.\"How he grew up is why he is here: Durant discovered his childhood salvation in basketball. And this stopover at Oakland International Airport was designed to help other kids do the same.The nine-time All-Star filled the plane with 80 youth basketball players, including teams from the Bay Area, in order to whisk them to Las Vegas for the BigFoot Hoops Classic.\"The main goal is to help the kids flourish,\" said Durant, 29, who is headed to Las Vegas for a pair of Team USA practices. \"As a young kid playing AAU, I know how important that is. It's just a transition from being a kid and loving the game to possibly doing this as a professional.\"Durant has a history of this kind of thing. Last year, he pledged more than $13 million to mostly education-oriented organizations en route to winning the NBA's \"Community Assist\" award. Now, he feels like he can do more. Earlier this month, Durant signed a two-year contract that will pay him $30 million next season with a player option worth $31.5 million for 2019-20.The Durant plane -- dubbed \"Flight 35\" after his jersey number -- wasn't the only notable arrival in Oakland recently. DeMarcus Cousins held his introductory press conference last week after signing with the reigning NBA champions for the taxpayer mid-level exception worth $5.3 million.Cousins is out indefinitely with an Achilles injury. But when he returns, the center will make the Warriors the first team since the 1975-76 Boston Celtics to play five All-Stars from the previous season at the same time.Durant hopes his new teammate recovers quickly.\"Oh, I'm so excited to have DeMarcus on the team,\" Durant said. \"I think he's going to be amazing. I think he's going to help us just as much as we help him. I can't wait for him to get back from his injury so he can get back to what he loves to do.\"Cousins has a checkered past because of a reputation for clashing with coaches, teammates and media. Durant says this will be a perfect fresh start.\"I know he's going to love the Bay Area and the fans in Oakland -- specifically Oakland,\" he said. \"That town, that community. His personality fits perfectly. I'm excited to see how he fits with the organization and with the city.\"Durant made fitting in look easy Wednesday. Dozens of high-school aged kids pressed against the glass to watch the 7-footer make his way down the jetway and into the waiting area. Durant arranged for all of them to get a pair of his latest signature shoe with Nike, the KD11.Camille Morales, a post player for the San Jose Cagers, called it a \"once-in-a-lifetime\" opportunity. She's a big Warriors fan who tries to emulate Durant's style of play.\"I try to incorporate the way he runs down the floor and gets out on the break,\" said Morales, who also plays for Archbishop Mitty High. \"When he gets a rebound, he sprints down the floor. ... I make sure I'm always hustling.\"For Jhaylon Martinez, a 6-foot-10 forward from Fairfield, the appeal was obvious: \"I like how he's so tall and can shoot.\"Durant was happy to have them aboard. He serves as an adviser to the CEO at Alaska Airlines, working alongside Brad Tilden to help develop opportunities for kids in the Bay Area. Durant joked that he wants more executive power. \"I tell (Tilden) that I have an 'in' to the streets as a millennial,\" he said. \"So he may need to lean on me a little more.\"For now, he was glad just to have an airplane full of kids. Face on the side or not, Durant just wants their dreams to take flight.___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "485"}

(Photo by Josh Lefkowitz/Getty Images)The UCLA football team will be starting fall camp on Friday and with so many changes occurring, there are several things to watch for. Here are five that we will be keeping a close eye on\u2026The UCLA football team enters fall camp with a lot of questions. Some of which will be answered quickly, some that will be answered just before the Bruins\u2019 season opener on September 1 when they take on Cincinnati at the Rose Bowl.So with that in mind, here are five things that we will be closely looking at as fall camp progresses.1. Implementing DisciplineOne thing that is going to be imperative to the success of this team is discipline. Chip Kelly is going to need all of his players to have the utmost focus and actively work towards making better decisions.Penalties have to be drastically reduced. If Kelly wants to have a certain type of tempo for his offense, he needs his players to not to make dumb decisions which could set both the offense and defense back.For example, the offensive line is going to have to be a lot more disciplined and has to be on the same page to try and limit offsides. Defenders are going to be more cognizant of how they tackle and not obtain any targeting calls. This might be hard with the team\u2019s lack of experience and a transition to a new system. Costly penalties need to be a thing of the past or this team is going nowhere (except backward).Last year, UCLA averaged 8.2 penalties per game which was good for 126th in the FBS. That has to be reduced drastically. Will fall camp be enough time for the Bruins to make such a big change?", "id": "486"}

This win moved Mercedes to the top of the wins list for the first time this year.Mercedes passed Scuderia Ferrari on this season\u2019s team wins list with Hamilton\u2019s victory in the Hungarian Grand Prix. Both teams entered the race with four victories. Like Mercedes, Ferrari have had just one of their drivers win at least one race this season. Like Hamilton, that lone driver, Sebastian Vettel, is a four-time Formula 1 champion.Mercedes and Ferrari had previously been tied atop the team wins list two, three and four victories, but Ferrari were able to earn their first, second, third and fourth victories before Mercedes did. However, Mercedes earned their fifth before Ferrari did thanks to Hamilton\u2019s dominant performance at the Hungaroring.Hamilton\u2019s win means that Mercedes, Ferrari and Aston Martin Red Bull Racing, the other team that have won at least one race this season with three victories, have now combined to win each of the last 107 races. Lotus were the last team not named Mercedes, Ferrari or Red Bull Racing to win a race when Kimi Raikkonen won the 2013 Australian Grand Prix driving for the team.How did Mercedes\u2019 fifth victory of the 2018 season affect the Formula 1 Team Power Rankings?

(Photo by Wesley Hitt/Getty Images)The OKC Thunder have a prime opportunity to win big in the West, but to do so these four players need to improve next year.For the OKC Thunder, the 2018-2019 season is arguably their best shot to legitimately contend for a Finals berth in the Western Conference. Their primary competition last year\u2013namely the Houston Rockets\u2013lost key role players and is poised for a big step back in the standings.The conference\u2019s top dog is the Golden State Warriors added yet another All-NBA big man in DeMarcus Cousins this summer, but they clearly had emotional and motivational problems last year that might re-surface again this season.Outside of a few young upstarts in the middle of the conference in the Utah Jazz and the Denver Nuggets, there aren\u2019t many teams better equipped to make their way up the conference ladder.However, if OKC are going to make the leap this year, they absolutely need to address some of the more glaring roster flaws.For the past two years they\u2019ve been one of the shallowest teams in the league, rarely having any impact players to fill in when one of the starters goes out. Furthermore, OKC\u2019s complete lack of three-point shooting has made their offense far too predictable to advance in the bloodbath that has become the Western Conference. Seemingly the Thunder have the right players to address those problems, but for one reason or another, those guys just haven\u2019t come through to their potential yet.To that end, here are the four players on the roster who must improve next year for the OKC Thunder to succeed.", "id": "488"}
{"content": "Last season the Philadelphia Eagles had many injuries, now they are looking to get back to full strength. With training camp starting how close are they?2018 training camp is underway for the Philadelphia Eagles and many players are looking to rebound from injuries sustained last year. While some of the players can suit up and be ready to play immediately there are still some players that will be missing time on the field. You may be wondering who is ready and who isn\u2019t. After all, a Super Bowl defense could potentially depend on that.With that, we\u2019ll look at the injury status of key players on the Eagles roster as camp gets underway.Jason Peters, LTNine-time Pro-Bowler Jason Peters was carted off the field in the Eagles\u2019 Week 7 matchup against the Redskins. He sustained a torn MCL and ACL in his right knee that caused him to miss the remainder of the regular season and playoffs.Many people thought that would be the last time we would see Peters in an Eagles uniform, but those people were wrong. After rehabbing the injury, the 36-year old tackle appears to be back to full strength and should be ready to resume his normal role immediately.Darren Sproles, RBThe pass-catching specialist out of the backfield suffered one of the strangest injuries that happened all of last season. In Week 3 against the Giants, Darren Sproles broke his arm and tore his ACL all on the same play. With two injuries of that nature, it was enough to end his season.Fans of the 35-year old running back will be happy to hear that Sproles should be back in action at full-strength. Expect to see him share the backfield load with Jay Ajayi and Corey Clement.Brandon Graham, DEBrandon Graham\u2019s injury was kept under wraps by him and the organization during the season. It wasn\u2019t known by the public until he underwent ankle surgery on May 1. Luckily for the Eagles, he was able to play through the injury and make history when he forced Tom Brady to fumble the football late in the fourth quarter of the Super Bowl.It appears that Graham will start training camp on the Physically Unable to Perform (PUP) List. Don\u2019t expect him to play during the preseason either. Best-case scenario for Graham is to be healthy enough to play Week 1.Chris Maragos, STeam captain and special teams ace Chris Maragos was injured in Week 6 of last season against the Panthers. He tore his ACL and PCL ligaments causing his season to end prematurely. Maragos is still having some injury concerns as he\u2019ll be on the PUP list as well. The other question surrounding him now is if he will make the team? He is returning from injury to a team with a lot of depth.Alshon Jeffery, WRLike Graham, Alshon Jeffery kept his injury woes out of the headlines. He played much of last season with a torn rotator cuff, and was still able to play at a high level. The injury forced him to have surgery shortly after the season ended in February. Jeffery\u2019s timetable to return is still up in the air. He\u2019ll likely miss training camp with the hope to be ready by Week 1. That still may be a stretch for the star wide receiver.Jordan Hicks, LBJordan Hicks, the Eagles \u201cQB of the defense,\u201d was injured during a Week 7 victory over the Washington Redskins. He ruptured his Achilles in that game and was forced to watch the rest of the season from the sidelines. Hicks, like many of the other injured Eagles players is projected to make a full recovery. Expect to see him leading the defense once again when Week 1 rolls around.Timmy Jernigan, DTTimmy Jernigan was one of the few lucky Eagles to be able to play through his injuries to help guide the team to a Super Bowl victory. He couldn\u2019t hold off surgery forever though. In late-April, he had surgery on a herniated disk in his back.With initial reports that the recovery time was 4-6 months., it\u2019s hard to tell exactly when he\u2019ll be back. If he is able to recover in the four month timespan that will make him ready for Week 1. That is the optimistic view though, as it\u2019s definitely a possibility that he\u2019ll miss more time.Sidney Jones, CBThe Eagles took a chance last year selecting Sidney Jones in the second round knowing that he had an Achilles injury that would hold him out for a considerable amount of time. He was only able to play one game at the end of the season before the Eagles decided to shut him down completely.While he did miss some time during OTAs due to soreness, he\u2019s expected to be at full strength this season. He\u2019ll be someone to keep an eye on as many people believe he\u2019ll be an opening day starter.Carson Wentz, QBLast but not least, we have Carson Wentz, the most watched and worrisome injury on the entire roster. Wentz tore his ACL and LCL in a Week 14 victory over the Rams. We all know what happened after that with Nick Foles leading the team to a Super Bowl victory.While it was expected that Wentz would miss some games this season due to his injury, that may not be the case. Wentz\u2019s goal is to be ready for Week 1, and all the videos surfacing online of Wentz moving around in a knee brace definitely makes Eagles fans optimistic. Yet it\u2019s still too early to tell for Wentz. The Eagles may have to make a decision if getting him back for Week 1 is important enough to risk him further injuring his knee. The good news for the Eagles is Foles is primed and ready to go when needed.", "id": "489"}

Since Derrick Rose\u2019s injury, his fans have dwindled, but the ones left over are true to promoting him.Although, Rose has found some new fans with the Timberwolves as he played his heart out during his playoff match up against the Houston Rockets. Coming back as a possible third string point guard for the Timberwolves on a minimum contract is donating his body for his belief in the Wolves\u2019 culture and coach Tom Thibodeau.What Derrick Rose has done off the court this off season is a bit similar to taking a lesser contract with the Wolves, but it\u2019s even more noteworthy than his on the court actions.Kyle Ratke is a writer for the NBA and details Rose\u2019s scholarship below:Via, NBA.com\u201cThe program is open to high school sophomore, junior + senior students who are civically minded and have an instinct to lead. He is gifting 1 grand prize winner up to $200,000, paid out $25k per semester for 4 years + 2 smaller winners for up to $20k (paid out fall 2018, 1 time payment).\u201dDerrick Rose has made a lot of money in his career, especially after being named the youngest MVP in NBA history. Not to mention his near $200 million in Adidas money that he\u2019s been receiving over the course of his career.You would think that his multiple career ending injuries would stop him from spending that money in the wrong place, but maybe he\u2019s putting it in the right place. With these donations to children\u2019s colleges this year, Rose makes himself a hero on and off the court \u2013 helping as many people as he can.Truly giving back to the needy around the country will cement Rose as one of the greatest sports figures of all time, at the mere age of 29.Now all there is for Rose to do is end his career on a good note over the next few seasons, hopefully with the Timberwolves. He\u2019s in a crazy busy rotation with Jeff Teague and Tyus Jones, but if anyone can make Rose fit in a roster it would be the expert in Tom Thibodeau.You can expect Rose fans to come out of the woodworks if he ends up playing on a high level this season while donating $400,000 of his own money \u2013 be ready for it.", "id": "490"}
{"content": "July 31--In only days, the Skokie Police Department's first lip syncing music video, filled with scores of personnel groovin' and movin', has become a small viral hit online and adds to the unique community outreach efforts being engaged by law enforcement agencies across the country.At the end of the five-minute video posted on the police department's Facebook page, Skokie police Chief Tony Scarpelli, after shaking it up to \"Ice Ice Baby,\" delivers his own challenge to other area departments.\"I hope you liked our video today,\" Scarpelli says. \"I'd like to thank the community for all their support. And I now challenge the Lincolnwood and Niles police departments.\"The Skokie Police Department's goal wasn't to make cable network stations MTV or VH1 take notice or to become the most famous lip syncing group since Milli Vanilli, rather, it's another way to inspire the community to see their local police in a more non-traditional light, Scarpelli said.\"I think it shows the humanistic side of officers,\" the chief said. \"We're very pleased we have such an excellent relationship with this community. This is just one more way to bond with the community and show our human side and that we're approachable.\"Since being posted on the social media site Saturday, the video is closing in on two million views and has had more than 25,500 likes and nearly 35,000 shares -- as of Tuesday.\"It shows police officers having a lot of fun,\" Scarpelli said.If the comments are any indication, the video is a big hit.\"OMG. Your video is AMAZING!\" writes one early poster. \"I loved the songs!! Thank you all for your service and dedication to your community. Bless you all.....stay safe!\"The video borrows a page from other police department outreach efforts and most notably a music video from the department in Northfolk, Va. That video has been seen on Facebook some 70 million times.In Skokie's case, there was a remarkably quick turnaround time between the filming and the posting. The video was shot Thursday -- two days before it became available for the world to see.Heather Jackson of Kaleidoscope Dance in Skokie was called in to help direct the officers' dance moves, officials said, as they moved from one room to another in the police department's headquarters.\"Face back with the right arm up, then reach up, then go left, then go forward, to the right, to the left, jump up,\" Jackson said, directing the officers just before one scene was filmed.Skokie's lip-sync challenge is packed with dance-worthy numbers starting with the theme to the hit television show \"Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\" and including parts of \"We Will Rock You,\" \"Macho Man,\" \"Macarena,\" \"Hey Sexy Lady,\" \"YMCA\" and more.In uniform, officers and others twirl and strut with energy while mouthing familiar lyrics not usually heard in a police station. On screen and behind the scenes, the participants appeared to be having a blast.Officer Yunsoo Shin emerges as one of the stars of the video, leading a hallway filled with officers in an especially exuberant number.Officer Mary Escobedo also gets her moment in the limelight by opening \"Macarena\" in the crime prevention unit with many colleagues behind her.According to Skokie officials, the original idea for the video came from Officer Robert Ochoa, who gets the honor of opening the piece by lip-syncing the \"Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\" theme.Skokie Marketing and Communications Director Ann Tennes said that once the village decided to dance on with this, she thought it would be good to find a local business to help.\"I started thinking who could I bring in -- what local resources could we bring to the effort,\" Tennes said. \"One phone call to Heather and she was immediately on board and all in. She's done a great job.\"The Skokie Police Department recently launched a police recruitment video on Facebook that was also well received. The village has been using the web and social media to ramp up outreach efforts, Tennes said.\"We want the community to be proud,\" she said. \"We know they are proud but we want to give them even more reason. We always look for new ways for that to happen.\"___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "491"}

{"content": "Don't give up on trading Asia. Between 2009 and 2018, the value of annual dividends paid out by Asian companies tripled, while payouts from the rest of the world doubled in value, according to a recent study. I believe Asian stocks have more potential for long-term dividend growth than their U.S. counterparts for a number of reasons. Despite the trade war rhetoric, earnings growth among Asian companies has maintained the momentum that started in late 2016, which reversed a three-year trend of deflation and earnings declines for many companies. Asian companies have also weaned themselves from an over-reliance on debt, and today are less leveraged than those in the United States. And of course, the broader Asia growth story and rise of the consumer class is still alive and well.  Valuations among these companies are also far more attractive than they are in the U.S., thanks to U.S. fund selling driving down the prices of most Asian stocks. In other words, U.S. markets have already built huge earnings expectations into many stock prices and valuations are at historically high levels. By contrast, many Asian stocks have already had the worst case trade war scenario built into them. If you are interested in capturing some of that dividend growth potential from Asian stocks, there are several ways to do it. My preference would be to buy a broad-based fund or ETF that has a number of dividend-paying companies in the portfolio. The first is an old-fashioned, but effective, way. You can buy a mutual fund from a company whose sole focus is Asia - the Mathew Asia Dividend Fund (MATIX) . Its top holdings include well-known blue chips such as Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM)  and HSBC (HSBC) . But it also includes less well-known names to American investors including Shenzhou International Group Holdings (SHZHY) , which is the largest knitwear manufacturer in China and makes clothing for Nike (NKE)  and others. Its stock soared an incredible 4,200% over the past decade. The next way for you to access Asian dividends is through exchange traded funds (ETFs). There are several that focus on Asian dividend payers, including the iShares Asia/Pacific Dividend ETF (DVYA) , the WisdomTree Asia Pacific ex-Japan Fund (AXJL)  and the O'Shares FTSE Asia Pacific Quality Dividend ETF (OASI) .

The Yankees won 10-2. (Photo by Mitchell Layton/Getty Images)As the Baltimore Orioles plummet to the bottom of the league standings and toward the #1 overall pick in 2019, should they make even bigger moves in their tear-down?The Baltimore Orioles are neck-and-neck with the Kansas City Royals for the honorary distinction of being the worst team in the MLB. Each team is subtracting major pieces from their club, as they make a late-season push to outdo the other.In baseball, there is only one winner and 29 losers. With that said, there is also only one team who finishes last in the standings and gets the first overall draft pick in 2019. Orioles or Royals? Don\u2019t count out the Chicago White Sox just yet either.According to Fangraphs projected standings, though, the Orioles are the team who will likely finish at that bottom of the barrel. After all, they do have the worst record in the majors as of this writing (31-74).They have already cashed in on a half year of Manny Machado and Zach Britton in an attempt to replenish a desolate farm system which is devoid of international signees.

{"content": "Aug. 03--The festivities are now well underway at the Pro Football Hall of Fame, a celebratory summer weekend as Brian Urlacher and six other members of the Class of 2018 are honored for their contributions to the sport.Also on the itinerary: the first of 65 NFL exhibition games to be played over the next four weeks. That formality came Thursday night when the Bears fell to the Ravens 17-16 at Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium.Before kickoff, there was Urlacher again on the football field, being introduced and making his way down a high-five line of current Bears players. The eight-time Pro Bowl linebacker planned to stick around. But only for part of the first half as he then made his way to a nearby party in his honor.Fair enough. Urlacher, after all, was always praised for his instincts, quickness and decision-making.For those dying for even a small taste of football, Thursday night's game probably wasn't exactly what they craved, an exhibition game at a neutral site with very few notable players on either side participating.The game's first play? A perfectly appropriate dump-off from Chase Daniel to fullback Michael Burton.Backup quarterback to fullback. Checkdown. Gain of 3.Ah, yes. The preseason.Officially, sure, Thursday marked the first game Matt Nagy has coached since joining the Bears in January. But it was hardly a sneak preview of what's to come in the months ahead.For starters, Nagy kept just about every potential starter on offense and defense confined to the bench. So there were no Mitch Trubisky darts to analyze or Jordan Howard runs to admire.No Allen Robinson or Tarik Cohen or Trey Burton or even Kevin White.Not even a glimpse of promising rookie receiver Anthony Miller.Said Nagy: \"In my opinion, it doesn't make sense (to play those guys). It just doesn't. We still have a quarter of a season left to play before we play Week 1. So it's just a risk-reward deal. And it's just too much of a risk for such little reward.\"Furthermore, Nagy isn't about to show off too much of his offensive ingenuity in the preseason anyway, keeping things simple with his play-calling. The real creativity, the true glimpses into the new coach's aggressive attack won't be seen until September.Stay patient. The wait continues.Thursday's big-picture takeaway for Nagy?\"You get to see where your depth is,\" he said. \"You get to see where guys are at and what you need to work on from here.\"The Bears trailed 10-7 at halftime on Thursday. Offensively, there was a well-executed 4-yard touchdown pass from Daniel to Burton and a 30-yard run by Benny Cunningham, the longest play of the first half.Defensively, DeAndre Houston-Carson delivered for the Bears with an early interception of Robert Griffin III. And if there was anything significant to be gleaned from the night, it's that Vic Fangio's group played fast and aggressive and may have enough quality depth to further stabilize a defense that finished in the top 10 in yards allowed last season.The Ravens used Griffin and Josh Woodrum at quarterback before halftime, not exactly the Aaron Rodgers-Matthew Stafford-Kirk Cousins triple threat the Bears will face in the NFC North this fall. But it was still encouraging to see the second-unit defense applying consistent pressure with five sacks in the first half. The Bears finished with eight sacks for the game.A 10-yard Tanner Gentry touchdown catch with 2:44 left gave the Bears an opportunity to steal a victory late. But Tyler Bray's two-point conversion pass to Daniel Brown failed.Still, there are bigger tests ahead as August unfolds. And while Thursday's game may have given general manager Ryan Pace a better idea of how his 53-man roster might shape up, every part of the night has to be viewed with proper perspective. Until the Bears have multiple games with their starters in action, even a surface-level assessment of their progress is difficult.The Hall of Fame celebration will continue through Sunday. The biggest event, of course, is Saturday night's enshrinement ceremony, giving Urlacher a chance to step on stage and formally thank those who helped him reach Hall of Fame heights.Nagy and the current Bears, however, will be back in Bourbonnais, resuming practice Saturday morning and gearing up for their second exhibition game next week in Cincinnati. That contest should offer at least a glimpse of the starters.dwiederer@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "495"}
{"content": "Aug. 04--The chorus is growing around Wrigley Field, though Javier Baez is trying not to listen.But unless he starts wearing headphones 24/7, it's going to be impossible to shut out the MVP talk attached to his name.A game like Friday's 5-4 victory over the Padres, in which Baez homered, tripled, pulled out his swim move and threw a runner out at the plate, provided yet another example of his value to the Cubs on offense, defense and the basepaths, not to mention the overall buzz factor at Wrigley he creates.Baez is hitting .407 with four homers, a triple, three doubles and 10 RBIs over his last seven games, leading the league with 84 RBIs and head-turning moments.\"It makes me nervous, to be honest,\" Baez said. \"I don't want to play with numbers. We'll see at the end, in September. And when we get to September, it's going to be about playoffs. We'll see. When things come up and when the numbers come up, we'll see in the offseason what I get for this season.\"The Cubs eeked out a victory over the Padres despite a shaky ninth inning from Pedro Strop, who gave up a pair of runs but was saved with one out and a runner at third when third baseman David Bote fielded a grounder off Manuel Margot's bat and nailed Cory Spangenberg at the plate with the tying run. Strop then struck out Austin Hedges to end it, gyrating on the mound and pumping his fist twice to celebrate.\"Too many times in our industry we get hung up on offensive numbers but we won the game based on defense,\" manager Joe Maddon said. \"Two plays at the plate, two outstanding plays. One by Javy, and one by Bote at third base. To me, that's the game.\"Jose Quintana earned his 10th victory with a dominant six-inning outing, allowing one run on four hits with six strikeouts and no walks. It was the Quintana the Cubs thought they got when he was acquired last year for top prospects Eloy Jimenez and Dylan Cease. With the arrival of Cole Hamels, the improvement of Quintana and Kyle Hendricks and the demotion of Tyler Chatwood, the Cubs rotation finally is beginning to build some momentum.\"Everybody knows Cole, and we know how much experience he had and how much he can bring,\" Quintana said. \"I'm really happy to be a part of a rotation like that.\"The Cubs took an early lead on Baez's opposite-field home run in the second and Ben Zobrist's third-inning sacrifice fly, and led 4-1 in the seventh on Anthony Rizzo's solo home run down the right-field line. The Padres pulled to within two on Steve Cishek's throwing error in the eighth and had the tying runs in scoring position when Baez, who had moved from shortstop to second base to start the inning, threw out Kevin Jankowski at the plate.\"That's Javy being Javy,\" Bote said. \"That's a baseball play. He read it, saw it was a line drive so (Jankowski) kind of froze (when he) had to read it, make sure he didn't catch it. He noticed that and in a split-second made the adjustment to go home, and he was out by eight feet. It wasn't even bang-bang. He saw it, he read it. I don't think he was pre-planning that. I think that was just him playing baseball and recognizing the situation.\"Brandon Kintzler got out of the inning by inducing Christian Villanueva to line out, and Baez started the bottom of the eighth lining one to the right-field corner and beating the throw with his Matrix-like slide into third.\"I don't plan it, I just react to it,\" Baez said. \"\"I just switch my hands. I don't know how I do it to be honest. It has happened more than three times this year, I keep thinking the ball is going to beat me and if I can do it I will do. Hopefully they don't catch me.\"Maddon said \"you can never coach instinct,\" adding Baez \"sees things\" no one else does.\"We kind of have this sign language communication going on during the game,\" Maddon said. \"He sees things and I'm back with him. I would not mess with that kid's head. He plays on the highest level mentally, and you don't want to interfere with that.\"That's what MVPs do. But just make sure it's whispered so Baez can't hear it.\"If he continues to do what he does ...\" Rizzo said. \"I'm sure other guys around the league are having tremendous years as well, but he's on a first-place team with a lot of expectations and he's carrying the load.\"psullivan@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "496"}
{"content": "Condoms shouldn\u2019t be reused, the CDC warns. Even if it\u2019s washed with soap and water, that won\u2019t remove harmful organisms on the condom that can lead to more serious complications for both participants. ( Pixabay )In case it's still not painfully obvious, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now warns sexually active individuals not to wash and reuse condoms.A condom is not an item of clothing, but a lot of people still don't understand that concept. A paper published in 2012 found that 1.4 to 3.3 percent of people admitted to having reused the same condom during sexual intercourse. Just note that these are just percentages of people who actually admitted to doing it.A condom is designed to be used exactly just one time. At any point once it's removed, it should be thrown away, no exceptions. People who reuse condoms are putting their partner at risk of sexually transmitted diseases.Not only is washing and reusing condoms downright disgusting, but it's also useless and ineffective. Soap and water won't eliminate microorganisms such as HIV or hepatitis C that may be present on the condom after sex.Why Some People Reuse CondomsSo why do some people reuse condoms? Well, there are a number of reasons. First, according to Forbes, is the cost. Typically, condoms are fairly inexpensive, but not so in many other countries. For example, in 2015, a Bloomberg report revealed that because of economic conditions and short supply, condoms in Venezuela cost as high as $755 at one point.The second reason is that there might be a condom shortage across the globe. For example, New Zealand has been facing shortages on larger-sized condoms. Also, some people who run out simply may not be willing to go out to a pharmacy or vending machine to get another one.The third reason is that some people simply don't understand the importance of using new condoms for each sex act and have no grasp on the potential hazardous impacts of reusing condoms. Condoms are among the most effective means of birth control and preventing the spread of STDs, with a 98 percent effectiveness rate. This number drops when a condom is used incorrectly.What Happens When You Reuse Condoms\"Incorrect use, such as reusing a condom or using more than one at a time, diminishes the protective effect of condoms by leading to condom breakage, slippage, or leakage,\" according to Elizabeth Torrone, an epidemiologist at the CDC's Division of STD Prevention.Simply put, used condoms should be thrown away immediately, even if no ejaculation occurs after sex.\"You should use the condom in the way the manufacturer has intended and tested \u2014 if you don't, you cannot rely on the condom anymore to do those duties,\" according to OB-GYN Alyssa Dweck.", "id": "497"}

How will the minutes and roles be divided amongst the players?After what was considered a \u201cdown\u201d season for one of the more consistent mid-major programs in the country, San Diego State bounced back in 2018. They claimed a win over the 12th-ranked Gonzaga Bulldogs in the non-conference and claimed a pair of wins over the Mountain West\u2018s best team in Nevada. One of them was in the conference tournament, which propelled them to the NCAA Tournament.The Aztecs will be looking to head back to the Big Dance in Brian Dutcher\u2019s second season as head coach. And they received positive news this offseason for that quest. The team\u2019s two best players and best pro prospects Matt Mitchell and Jalen McDaniels both decided to return to the team, helping to solidify their starting lineup. It helps ease the frontcourt losses of Cameron Rooks and Malik Pope, along with Trey Kell on the perimeter. Max Montana also opted to go pro overseas, with Montaque-Gill Caesar leaving midway through last year.Now comes this upcoming campaign for San Diego State, with the roster looking a little different from before. There are more athletes with versatility, along with guys who\u2019re better scorers overall than from the prior seasons. That creates more opportunities for the team but also more decisions to be made about the rotations.With the available players for next season (sorry Malachi Flynn), I\u2019ll be using the traditional positions to project what each Aztec will bring to the 2018-19 season.", "id": "499"}

Redick remains on a flexible, one-year deal that leaves cap space open next summer.Perhaps the biggest change between last year\u2019s squad and next year\u2019s will be Markelle Fultz. Or the state of Markelle Fultz. After playing just 14 games last year, the former No. 1 projects to take on a significant role next season. There have also been rumblings that his jumper is completely rebuilt.A pre-injury version of Fultz would trump almost any free agency signing. Fultz still has the innate talent that made him the top prospect in his class, combining elite athletic tools with an impressive blend of poise and fluidity on the offensive end.Naturally, when we took to Twitter for mailbag questions, several revolved around Fultz, his potential impact and his effect on the Sixers\u2019 competitive status.

{"content": "July 30--SAN DIEGO -- They haven't quite pinned down their exact plans, but it's unlikely general manager Bobby Evans and vice president of baseball operations Brian Sabean will make any drastic decisions.The Giants are 6.5 games out in the National League West and 6.0 games out of the second wildcard spot and their recent play hasn't given the front office or ownership group reason to believe that they have the makings to earn a playoff berth.As they prepare to start a two-game series in San Diego, the Giants' roster could be in flux as the club must make several roster decisions that aren't related to buying or selling.Pitching probablesMonday: Derek Holland (5-8, 3.92) vs. Eric Lauer (5-7, 5.29), 7:10 p.m., NBCSBA (TV)Tuesday: Dereck Rodr\u00edguez (5-1, 2.75) vs. Clayton Richard (7-10, 5.05), 1:10 p.m., NBCSBA (TV)Three things to watch1. Will the Giants sneak in a pre-deadline trade?Time is running out for the Giants to add or subtract before the non-waiver deadline, but it's easier to envision the front office waiting until August to fully embrace \"sell\" mode.The Giants were never planning on trading Madison Bumgarner, and there will be opportunities to move Andrew McCutchen next month on waivers if they fall completely out of the race. Other players who might net the Giants a prospect or two include Sam Dyson and Derek Holland, who could also be on the post-deadline trade radar if the price is right.With a long list of relievers from selling clubs still available, it's difficult to envision the Giants floating Tony Watson or Will Smith out to contending teams and having them make an offer Evans and Sabean simply can't refuse.The franchise is committed to remaining under the luxury tax threshold and if players like Johnny Cueto and Pablo Sandoval end up on the disabled list, it will further restrict the team's ability to add an asset or two.2. What will the Giants decide with Cueto and SamardzijaTwo highly-paid veteran right-handers are dealing with significant injuries, and neither is healthy enough to contribute right now.Cueto reported feeling pain in his elbow after every pitch following his Saturday start and will likely end up on the disabled list before the Giants' two-game set in San Diego begins. It's possible the pitcher and the Giants' medical staff have discussed the possibility of shutting him down for the remainder of the season and there's also a chance Tommy John surgery reenters the equation.Manager Bruce Bochy hasn't provided an update on Samardzija of late, but the Giants are hopeful a period of rest will help ease the stress on his ailing shoulder and allow him to contribute at some point later on this season.With decisions regarding the duo's rest, rehab and recovery likely coming soon, the Giants have to determine how they'll structure their rotation moving forward.3. How will the Giants handle first base?Brandon Belt isn't eligible to return from the disabled list until Sunday and Sandoval is probably headed for a disabled list stint after injuring his hamstring in the Giants' win over the Brewers, which leaves the team short-handed in the infield.If Sandoval is out, the Giants may recall Ryder Jones, who can play both corner infield positions and has enjoyed a strong season with Triple-A Sacramento. However, they don't necessarily have to bring up a third or first baseman, because catcher Buster Posey can play first and they're also facing a pair of left-handers in San Diego.Posey will likely catch Monday and play first base Tuesday, with utility players Austin Slater and Chase d'Arnaud left to cover first base in other situations until Belt returns.___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "502"}
{"content": "A NASA-led study released on July 30 ruled out the possibility of transforming Mars to a habitable state like Earth by tallying all possible scenarios to make this happen. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, however, begged to differ. ( NASA )An analysis of 20 years of spacecraft data from NASA dismisses the possibility of terraforming Mars, a hypothetical process of making the Red Planet hospitable like Earth.Ultimately, the study ruled that there is an inadequate supply of carbon dioxide on Mars to create an atmosphere that can sustain life. The team of scientists who worked on the analysis said the CO2 on the planet is not thick enough to produce liquid water on its surface.The team tallied all the possible scenarios of releasing enough CO2 on Mars, but it all leads to the conclusion that there is no available technology on Earth at present to make the terraforming possible.Elon Musk disagreed. In a tweet, he said Mars has massive CO2, and it can only take either an artificial or natural fusion to release them.Terraforming Mars Not Possible With Present-Day TechnologyFor the study, published in Nature Astronomy on July 30, the team of scientists analyzed the quantity of carbon-bearing minerals and the presence of CO2 in polar ice using data from NASA Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, Mars Odyssey spacecraft, and data on why ancient life forms did not survive on the Martian planet.The scientists found that Mars has enough water ice that can create water vapor, but low temperature prevents the water ice to vaporized and produce CO2. Releasing chlorofluorocarbons or other fluorine-based compounds may raise the atmospheric temperature, but that will require a large-scale manufacturing process that is, at present, impossible to do.The study noted that atmospheric pressure on Mars is less than one percent of the pressure of the Earth's atmosphere or only around 0.6 percent to that of Earth's. Raising temperatures on Mars requires a similar atmospheric pressure found on Earth.There is an accessible source of CO2 on Mars that can be found in the polar ice caps. Explosives can be used to vaporize it and absorb more solar radiation to increase temperatures. This process would, however, only double the Martian pressure to 1.2 percent of Earth's.Elon Musk Disagrees With NASAMusk argued that the Martian soil contained a massive amount of CO2 that can be released upon heating using either artificial or natural fusion. In fact, he said this process can terraform almost any large rocky body in the universe. The SpaceX CEO is referring to CO2 that may have been retained on Mars' rocks over time. Musk, in the past, also proposed exploding Mars with nuclear bombs to release sufficient CO2 that will make the planet habitable.NASA's paper had in fact already mentioned about the CO2 contained on Mars' soil. The scientists also considered heating the soil to release the needed gas, but they went back to the problem of how atmospheric pressure on Mars can reach a level similar to Earth's.The study has also looked into the carbon trapped in mineral deposits, but digging them up also requires amount of pressure close to Earth's. The same problem dismisses the likelihood of strip mining Mars to a depth of around 100 yards to harvest CO2 that is located close to the soil's surface.There is also the option of allowing the atmosphere to naturally build up from outgassing by geologic activity. This process would, however, take about 10 million years.The team had even calculated the possibility or redirecting comets and asteroids to collide with Mars. This process, however, requires thousands of asteroids and comets to be redirected toward Mars, but this is extremely impractical.\"Our results suggest that there is not enough CO2 remaining on Mars to provide significant greenhouse warming were the gas to be put into the atmosphere. In addition, most of the CO2 gas is not accessible and could not be readily mobilized. As a result, terraforming Mars is not possible using present-day technology,\" concluded Bruce Jakosky of the University of Colorado, the lead author of the study.", "id": "503"}

{"content": "ROBOTIC HIGH FIVE. On Monday, researchers at OpenAI, the nonprofit AI research company co-founded by Elon Musk, introduced Dactyl, an AI system trained to control a robotic hand. According to the researchers, the system can manipulate physical objects in the hand with dexterity never before possible for AI.The task Dactyl tackled might sound like something you\u2019d teach a toddler: take this six-sided block and move it around until a certain side is on top. Unlike a toddler, though, Dactyl needed more than a century\u2019s worth of experience to learn how to expertly complete the task. But thanks to powerful computers, the researchers were able to pack all that experience into just 50 \u201creal-world\u201d hours.PRACTICE MAKES (ALMOST) PERFECT. The researchers trained Dactyl in a simulated environment \u2014 that is, a digital setting with a computer-generated hand \u2014 using a technique called domain randomization. They built certain parameters into their simulated environment, such as the cube\u2019s size or the angle of gravity, and then randomized those variables. They had multiple simulated hands doing this at once. By pushing Dactyl to adapt to so many different virtual scenarios, the researchers prepared the AI\u2019s ability to adapt to scenarios in the real world.After 50 hours of training in the simulated environment, the AI could manipulate a real-world robotic hand to successfully complete its given task 50 times in a row (a successful completion was one in which the system didn\u2019t drop the block or take longer than 80 seconds). To figure out how to move the hand to complete the task, it simply needed to look at the block through a trio of cameras.ONE ALGORITHM TO TRAIN THEM ALL. As the researchers note in their blog post, they trained Dactyl using the same algorithm that they used for OpenAI Five, a team of five neural networks trained to play the computer strategy game DOTA 2. Dactyl\u2019s success proves it\u2019s possible to build a general-purpose algorithm that can teach AI to complete two very different tasks. This could make it much easier for researchers to train AI for lots of different purposes in the future, since they wouldn\u2019t need to start the process from scratch.READ MORE: Learning Dexterity [OpenAI Blog]", "id": "505"}

There are his parents, Sonny and Lola, walking around the Quest Multisport facility, making sure each detail is handled and the summer remains magical for the 346 registered youths at the fourth annual free camp.And then there's some of Parker's professional family making a surprise appearance to start forming that chemistry that possibly can translate to some winter magic at the United Center just a few blocks away.Parker wore a wide smile as he introduced Bobby Portis, Lauri Markkanen, Wendell Carter Jr. and others and then listened to Bulls director of player development Shawn Respert address campers on the importance of being good teammates.\"My parents are the reason I'm the person I am,\" Parker said. \"Even though I play basketball, I want to be known for more. It just helps me inside knowing I did something for somebody. That brings me inner peace.\"Parker wore a camper T-shirt rather than a supervisor T-shirt on purpose as he jumped from drill to drill, offering hands-on instruction at each station. He said this year's camp had a bit more significance now that he's a Bull.The finalist for last season's NBA Cares Community Assist award said he wanted to continue his community service during the season with blocks of free tickets and transportation to games as well as holiday giveaways.\"The feeling we receive from serving kids is the most wonderful experience in the world,\" Lola said. \"And I want to always continue to feel that, to see kids smile and interact with Jabari. He was once (one of) them, going to celebrity camps and feeling that same 'wow.' \"Indeed, Parker spoke eloquently of the impact of seeing his father's longstanding community service and also attending former Chicago Vocational and Michigan star Juwan Howard's camp as a kid.\"I owe it to the things I've been through to help me be the person I am today,\" Parker said. \"That's being a part of real charity at the Juwan Howard camp. He passed the torch to me. Now it's (about) inspiring that next kid to come behind me.\"NBA community service has been in the headlines all week. LeBron James, whom Parker cited as an inspiration, opened a school for at-risk kids in his native Akron, Ohio. Fellow Simeon product Derrick Rose launched a college scholarship program called \"The Rose Scholars.\"\"We have a conscience,\" Parker said. \"We know where we come from. Whatever we have, we want to give back and try to help our community. We know those struggles need to not prevail and we can eliminate (the obstacle of) those kids not having the right opportunities.\"Parker also hopes to bring Chicago's youth some joy with better Bulls basketball this winter. He has been working out at the Advocate Center with his new teammates since signing his two-year, $40 million deal. That Portis, Markkanen, Carter and others surprised him with their appearance touched him.\"It's going to take time to build that chemistry and those relationships,\" Parker said. \"All of us being so young is something that's special and something I'm looking forward to. We get a chance to play off each other.\"I've played with vets where it was like a one-sided relationship and I had to listen. It's different because we can pick each other's brains because we're growing.\"You can't go anywhere but up because we're so young. A lot of us haven't established an identity; we just have a lot of hype. It's up to us to make that situation good.\"Parker's ebullient mood even led to him toning down the anti-defense comments he made on WSCR-AM 670 on the day of his introductory news conference.\"People take it out of proportion and blow it out,\" he said of his comments. \"Basketball is a two-way street -- you've got to play offense and defense.

I did not like the look of the caviar on the boy bag, I like it way more on the flap bags. I went for the size small, not just because of price, but also because this bag looks way cuter in the small size. Besides I don\u2019t care much just anyways. With this being one of the hardest combinations to get, I am so grateful.I can\u2019t wait to wear this bag out and share with you guys how I style this bag. This bag will never leave my collection.

{"content": "ESPN just released their list of top-20 remaining free agents so we understandably ponder, \u201cdo any fit the needs of our beloved Cowboys?\u201dJust because training camp has begun doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s all sunshine and rainbows in Cowboys country. Dallas came into this preseason with plenty of question marks. And many of those question marks remain unanswered after the first few days of camp.While question marks are understandable the first week of training camp, they can\u2019t be taken for granted. Because the longer Dallas tests the waters with their own players, the more likely these options remaining on the market will dry up.So the question at hand is do any of these top remaining free agents fit the needs of the Cowboys this season. The answer seems to be, \u201cyes\u201d.Who fits the CowboysRather than recite the list, let\u2019s point out Dallas\u2019 needs and who ESPN listed as available options. After all, the list itself is ESPN\u2019s so let\u2019s let them have the honors of the complete unveiling.The Dallas Cowboys have needs at a few places, primarily at defensive tackle, free safety, and tight end. Lucky for them a couple of those fellas are available right now\u2026With the loss of David Irving for the foreseeable future (undergoing personal treatment now \u2013 serving four game drug suspension later) the Cowboys are thin in the middle.Fellow starter Maliek Collins recovering from injury only further exasperates the problems at DT. So with such little depth on the roster, why is Dallas completely ignoring proven options like Hankins?While they haven\u2019t said anything it\u2019s become glaringly obvious they have all but eliminated the traditional 1-tech roadblock from their defensive scheme. More on that here:While Hankins is undeniably good, he\u2019s not what Dallas is looking for in an interior linemen.The Dallas Cowboys are in need of a safety with some coverage ability. It\u2019s been my contention Tre Boston, who signed a cheap deal late in free agency with Arizona, was the best bang for the buck \u2013 Dallas thought otherwise.This leaves Reid as the best available option. Unfortunately, he appears to be unofficially blackballed from the NFL and doesn\u2019t seem to be an option for \u201cAmerica\u2019s Team\u201d. Other than Reid, there remains T.J. Ward, Mike Mitchell, and Kenny Vaccaro on the free agent scrap heap. The only problem with them is they\u2019re better fits as in-the-box strong safety than a centerfielding free safety.With Jason Witten and James Hanna retired, Dallas a clear need at TE. No matter how highly they think of Geoff Swaim, Blake Jarwin, or Dalton Schultz, the Cowboys are clearly gambling on the position.Antonio Gates and Julius Thomas are two proven options. Both are over-the-hill and without much upside, but both provide insurance in case Dallas\u2019 undeveloped options dry out.Don\u2019t hold your breath on any of these options because the Dallas Cowboys seem determined to make their own players work out. Scheme changes are a big factor as Dallas looks to phase out the need for 1-tech DTs and extra defensive backs. Tight end is the real wildcard here but even there it appears the Cowboys are intent on changing the role of the Dallas TE.The good news \u2013 free agents are still available. The boring news is \u2013 the Cowboys don\u2019t seem very interested.", "id": "510"}

Take me back to the warm weather and margaritas please! Lately, I\u2019ve been finding amazing deals on the cutest clothes. It\u2019s not always easy to find clothes that are affordable, cute and fit well. I wanted the perfect Summer set that was comfortable on and flattering in all the right places. I found this two-piece set from Forever 21. It comes in three beautiful Summer colors. I chose the blue because I thought it would look nice with tan skin. I love this set because each piece can be worn separately. The ruffle detailing in the top ties nicely with the tassels on the pants. I styled with a pair of tassel earrings (similar here) from ASOS. Of course you can find tassel earrings anywhere. I thought the contrast of pink earrings and a blue ensemble made for a great look. I kept my sandals neutral to balance out my colorful outfit. I recently picked up two pairs of TKEES sandals. These are the best minimalistic sandals I\u2019ve come across! They come in a variety of nude colors as well. My favorite part about these sandals is they don\u2019t feel or look cheap. A lot of times wearing sandals or flip-flops can really bring down an outfit, but not with these! Definitely add to the resort vibe I was going for. Highly recommend checking out their sandals.", "id": "511"}
{"content": "July 27--If a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, how does a comfort food tour begin? With a single recipe? With a kind word? With a generous, loving offer of safe harbor?Emily Nunn's journey of a thousand miles began with all of those things, leading her down a road reconnecting with friends and family she had thought lost to her, and into a kind of healing she needed more than anything in life, and which she thought would never come. Eventually, it led to \"The Comfort Food Diaries: My Quest for the Perfect Dish to Mend a Broken Heart,\" her singular, poignant and beautifully written memoir chronicling that search in vignettes so personal and at times so dark yet moving, that the words will rip your heart right out of you.\"When I started, I was so broken,\" Nunn said in an interview from her North Carolina home. \"It's hard to explain how completely lost I was.\"She wanted to cook with and be around people -- people who maybe had difficult lives -- \"I wanted to see how they did it.\" How they coped.Nunn is a journalist and food writer. A Southerner, born and raised in Virginia but living in North Carolina now, she writes freelance for such publications as Food52. Her comfort food tour was born in Chicago after a particularly cruel fall from what seemed the top of the world.After nearly 10 years at The New Yorker, she moved to Chicago about 15 years ago to take up arts and food writing for the Tribune, a job she loved. In 2008, she moved to Good Eating (the former name for what is now Food &amp; Dining), where she wrote deftly about such topics as her love of the toum (a garlic sauce) at Fattoush restaurant, or her fangirl crush on Ina Garten. I was a fan of Nunn's writing (her 1,400-word rant against 2004's rather new plague of made-up food holidays made me her fanboy), but I didn't know her well. Certainly not well enough to know what was going on in her life away from Trib Tower.By 2009, she had been laid off by the paper, like so many in those dark days of Tribune's bankruptcy (from which the company emerged in 2012). I didn't know what she was up to, where she was living or how she'd find work in a recession, when like hundreds of other Facebook friends, I read her raw cry for help in the night.As Nunn recounts in the book: \"One night I drank several glasses of sauvignon blanc and, in a fit of uncensored self-pity, broadcast the details of my wrecked life on Facebook for the unsolicited elucidation of around 350 so-called friends.\"Nunn was struggling with much more than a lost job. Her brother had killed himself, her fiance had broken off the engagement -- and basically taken away his daughter, whom Nunn had come to love as if she were her own. In the book, Nunn reconstructed that post, writing, in part: \"I have almost no money, no job, no home, no car, no child to pick up after school, no dog to feed, no one to care for. I am cold and alone\" -- and she was drinking again after being sober for years.The next morning, she expected a \"virtual scolding\" in an avalanche of Facebook comments, but instead woke up to an outpouring of love, offers of help (including a place to stay and money) and empathetic admissions of painful struggles. This, from distant friends and relatives and people she didn't even know well from across the country. Come visit, they said. We'll cook for you. Which meant, we'll take care of you. We'll ease the hurt. Make it a culinary tour, said a former sorority sister from Savannah, Eileen. And this seemingly crazy idea, from an old New Yorker friend, Kevin: \"It should be your comfort food tour.\"In short, that's what Nunn did. She launched a comfort food tour, and it was brilliant. Though real life is not as pat as a Mickey Rooney-Judy Garland plot, as Nunn references, the idea appealed because it gave Nunn something to do.\"I had to have this project: 'Come and we'll make comfort food for you,'\" Nunn said. There wasn't much of a plan, at first. \"It wasn't fleshed out. But it ended up being much deeper and richer. It ended up really changing my life. It's about this path I had to take.\"\"Comfort Food Diaries\" is not an addiction and recovery book, per se; Nunn handles that subject quickly. She doesn't dismiss it; she gives it weight -- including a breakdown that led to a psychiatric ward stay and a separate stint at The Betty Ford Center -- but she spends her time with the reader talking about other things: focusing on how she got to where she was in life and how to be happy.The tour started in earnest with a visit to her cousin Toni in Atlanta and continued with visits to other family members and friends: her aunt Mariah in Virginia, her sorority sister Portia on her Georgia farm, Wyler in Athens, Ga. Dot in North Carolina. All along the journey, she allowed these people who loved her to cook for her, to comfort her -- generosity she hadn't felt worthy of accepting before, and which continually surprised and humbled her.\"Comfort Food Diaries\" chronicles those visits in frank detail, the restorative conversations, the affirmations of long-ago cemented bonds, and because it's a culinary memoir, Nunn shares recipes, 56 in all. They finish off a story or underscore an emotional homecoming. Each illustrates a memory or acts as a coda to a chapter -- Martha's Virginia sweet chunk pickles, angel biscuits (to make country ham sandwiches) and great-grandmother's mean lemon cake. (Though Nunn remembers her grandma Augusta as mean, the title is a compliment, as in, \"that's one mean cake you baked, Grandma.\") And there's Nunn's spoon bread.The recipe illustrates Nunn's message. She writes about first tasting spoon bread at the Roanoake Hotel when she was 10: \"What was this stuff that made me want to push everyone out of the way in order to eat their serving?\" It took a good deal of work to get the results she wanted, which makes it all the more comforting.Nunn, however, suggested I include a dish she made with North Pond chef and owner Bruce Sherman, cheesy eggs on toast. At one point during her journey, Nunn was living in Charleston, S.C., but came to understand it wasn't right. \"It had all the signs of home, but it didn't feel like a home to me. So I split. That's when I needed to face Chicago down,\" she said.She went to see Sherman, whom she had covered while working for the Tribune. At the restaurant, they cooked the eggs on a portable burner in the dining room, because the staff was prepping for lunch, while she asked Sherman about how he came to start the restaurant. From the story about the path he took, Nunn took inspiration for her own -- \"Trust who you are, what you do, eventually you can't be anything other than yourself,\" he told her.Which is why Nunn suggested that we share the recipe, but also, she enthused: \"That dish is freaking awesome.\"But about that subtitle, \"My Quest for the Perfect Dish to Mend a Broken Heart.\" Book publishing and the need for a hook being what they are, it wasn't quite accurate. Nunn wasn't really looking for a dish to mend a broken heart, nor was the broken heart caused by the man. (\"People thought it was a chick-lit book,\" Nunn said.) It was everything: her family, her brother's death, losing her job, the breakup.\"The man was a small part of it. (The problem) was what led me to the man,\" she said, explaining that the quest became: \"What happened in my family to make me this way?\"And that's what she set out to discover.\"It's kind of like a hero's story. You face these dragons. I would take a step forward, and I would realize something, and I would take a step back. I was leaving my comfort zone and taking a step toward a dark past.\"I also learned something: It was like the crumbs (led) back to me. It was my crumb trail, but I was spreading the crumbs. I was deciding where the crumbs were. That part of the book was really amazing.\"And she came to look at cooking differently.When she lived in Chicago, she cooked a lot. \"I really enjoyed that part of being part of the family. But one thing that I really started to be aware of on this path, I became comfortable in other people's kitchens. I just did it. That's who I am now. I'll cook for you. Doesn't have to be the perfect ingredients. The idea of having a dinner party was really stressful in Chicago, but I don't worry now.\"Did she ever really find the answer to her quest? This is where she said she might cry.\"It's like the really corny line: It's the journey. You have to keep going with your life. The journey became the end.\"Did I find the perfect dish? No, of course not. Did I find what was missing from my life? Yes, I did. Really true connections with human beings. Saying yes to things, not being afraid.\"\"It was not the idea of wrapping it up into a neat little bow at the end. That is never what I was after. I was after finding out how to live, how other people live.\" An open heart with kindness, forgiveness. Not a wary way. \"I'm a completely different person now. Not completely different, but I'm changed. My relationship to things, the way things look, achievements, the exterior signs of a great life, I'm a lot less attached to those things now.\"I live in a barn, and I'm happy. The things I valued in people changed a lot. I am a lot more into kindness.\"jxgray@chicagotribune.comEmily's own spoon breadPrep: 30 minutesCook: 50 minutesMakes: 10 servingsFrom \"The Comfort Food Diaries\" (Atria Books, $26) by Emily Nunn.1 1/3 cups cornmeal1 1/2 teaspoons salt2 teaspoons granulated sugar2 1/2 cups whole milk4 tablespoons ( 1/2 stick) unsalted butter, melted5 large eggs, separated1 Heat the oven to 350 degrees.

{"content": "Aug. 03--Former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick is back in the game.The Madden game.Sort of.When \"Madden NFL 19\" was released recently, a sharp-eared Twitter user found that Kaepernick's name had been scrubbed from the game's soundtrack. When the deletion came to light Wednesday, it caused a furor. Sean Don, who sang the verse that included Kaepernick's name was not pleased.Neither was Houston Rockets guard Chris Paul.The deletion of Kaepernick's name seemed fishy given that he is currently pursuing a collusion grievance against the NFL. Kaepernick has been a polarizing figure ever since 2016 when he instituted silent protests during the national anthem at NFL games, drawing fire from no less than the president. He would like to resume his NFL career but has yet to find a team that will sign him.Thursday, Electronic Arts, maker of the Madden game apologized for erasing Kaepernick's name from the soundtrack.\"We made an unfortunate mistake with our Madden NFL soundtrack,\" EA said in a statement reported by ESPN. \"Members of our team misunderstood the fact that while we don't have rights to include Colin Kaepernick in the game, this doesn't affect soundtracks. We messed up, and the edit should never have happened. We will make it right, with an update to \"Madden NFL 19? on August 6 that will include the reference again.\"There's more than a little irony in play here, namely Sean Don complaining that EA was treating Kaepernick's name as a curse word. In the verse he sings, Sean Don himself rhymes Kaepernick's name with an expletive.\"Feed me to the wolves, now I lead the pack and s**t.

{"content": "July 27--Chicago police union president Kevin Graham blasted the proposed consent decree released Friday as \"illegal and invalid,\" calling it \"politically motivated\" while vowing to fight the plan in court.Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan and Mayor Rahm Emanuel held a joint press conference Friday afternoon announcing the reform plan for the city's embattled police department, encompassed in a 232-page draft. The proposal is not a done deal and will be open to public scrutiny before it's filed with Judge Robert Dow, who will then hold hearings involving stakeholders and eventually rule on a final consent decree.Drawing a comparison with the Los Angeles Police Department, which for more than a decade had operated under a consent decree, Graham said the agreement will cost taxpayers hundreds of millions.\"It is important to know that we at the FOP have tried to work with the attorney general of the state of Illinois, and they've refused to listen to us,\" Graham said during a press conference at the police union's headquarters. \"On the other hand, the attorney general was more than willing to listen to groups that were anti-police such as the ACLU and Black Lives Matter.\"Involving those groups in the policy's creation is \"a disaster,\" Graham said.\"The city and the attorney general have set a dangerous precedent by granting these groups influence into the policy of the Chicago Police Department,\" Graham said. \"Their willingness to do so reveals much about the true nature of this agreement and the magnitude of the threat that it imposes.\"Graham cast the officers' objection as a reflection of their commitment to public safety.\"We will continue to fight the consent decree to protect our officers and to protect the public because some of our public officials have failed to do so,\" Graham said.A coalition of civil rights organizations suing the city, including Black Lives Matter Chicago, the Chicago Urban League and the NAACP, in May released their own 10-point plan that called for a number of reforms.Among other things, the plan called for overhauling the police department's use of force policy and additional officer training in de-escalation strategies. The group also asked to remove officers from public schools and to reserve police intervention for \"real and immediate\" threats.And, when it comes to officers' use of Tasers, the group called for limitations such as prohibiting their use at schools and on pregnant women, children, elderly people, anyone in medical distress and those who are handcuffed or restrained.The coalition also called for the city to step up its efforts to divert people from the formal justice system by, among other things, limiting arrests for victimless crimes.Under the coalition's proposal, training on fair and unbiased policing would be required, and the department's hiring efforts would have to maintain diversity. The group also called for providing incentives to officers who don't use excessive force, reduce their number of arrests and treat people fairly.Karen Sheley, an attorney with the ACLU of Illinois, in a statement called the proposed consent decree \"an important step in the long process of reform,\" but said it likely needs more work before it's presented in court.\"Today, the organizations who have sued to bring about reform, including the ACLU, have started to examine the draft to see whether it is designed to meet the needs of Chicago residents. There is no simple and quick fix, and this document deserves our careful attention. Incredibly, this draft still does not require officers to record when they point a weapon at someone. The City of Chicago just settled a case for $2.5 million where police held a gun to the chest of a 3-year-old child. Given the absence of this provision, we need to examine this draft very closely. The movement toward reform of CPD did not culminate today -- but it has moved one step forward. We must all review and respond comprehensively to the draft to ensure a revised decree will successfully bring about the reform we have been waiting for.\"Sheila Bedi, a professor with Northwestern University's MacArthur Justice Center and an attorney who helped lead one of the lawsuits that lead to the consent decree proposal, said such a policy needs input from \"those most impacted by police brutality and violence.\" In a statement, Bedi said the community coalition's demands in May \"must be the measure of whether this ... will truly reduce the harm caused by the racism and violence that permeates the CPD.\"During a question-and-answer session with reporters Friday, Graham expressed concerns with the timing and some of the plan's specifics.Graham said he was notified \"less than 24 hours ago\" that the document would be released. The attorney general, he said, had recently indicated to them \"this was far off in the distance and they were far from having this completed.\"Graham said he thinks the city and Madigan's office are trying to \"box in\" the federal judge to accept the deal.Asked if he feels heard by the mayor's office and like they've been a partner, Graham said he hasn't had \"much contact\" with the mayor's office.\"I have been president of Lodge 7 for more than a year, and I have never had a meeting with the mayor,\" he said.Asked about increased mental health support, Graham said he brought that up to the police superintendent in their first meeting together, and the superintendent was supportive. He also said his group has \"never been opposed to training.\"Graham said the FOP doesn't believe the attorney general has standing in federal court as there's \"never been\" a state attorney general who's filed a consent decree in federal court.\"When you add it up, it's going to cost a lot of money, and that money should really be spent on officers insurance, retiree health insurance, a new police academy,\" he said. \"To hand a bill to the taxpayers, that's just wrong.\"Chicago Tribune reporters Rosemary Sobol and Annie Sweeney contributed.gpratt@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "515"}
{"content": "With Rafael Devers on the disabled list, rumors are swirling about the Red Sox checking in on a former Sox third baseman. Could we see a surprise infield addition?With less than a day to go before the trade deadline, the rumors were guaranteed to fly. They always do. And there are always some interesting ones floating about. But late Monday night a truly interesting rumor hit Twitter. With starting third baseman Rafael Devers on the disabled list, the Boston Red Sox have apparently had conversations with the Texas Rangers about bringing Adrian Beltre back to Fenway Park. Beltre spent the 2010 season in Boston, and was beloved while there, but signed a long term deal with the Rangers that winter.Beltre played in 154 games that season, blasting 28 HR with a .321/.365/.553 triple slash while providing exceptional defense. These days the glove may be closer to average, but at 39 years old, that\u2019s still mighty impressive. And the bat hasn\u2019t dried up, either. The 30 home run power is gone, but he still boasts a .292/.342/.404 slash. He offers a significantly higher floor than Devers, though the 21-year-old\u2019s power keeps his ceiling higher than the Rangers third baseman.What would this trade mean for Devers?The first thing that comes to mind is that Devers\u2019 hamstring injury is worse than the team is letting on. The latest on his condition is that he feels pretty good and doesn\u2019t expect to be out more than the minimum 10 days. But this is the same team that had their manager claiming Mitch Moreland was only out for a routine day off the day before admitting it was because of a sore knee. While the Belichickian antics are not unappreciated, it\u2019s tough to feel completely sure that Devers really feels as good as he claims.But even if Devers is back on August 8, an Adrian Beltre trade makes some sense. One of the areas in which Devers needs the most help is with the glove. Who better to teach him than one of the best defensive third basemen of the last two decades? The mentoring alone might be worth the price in trade chips. Add to that the fact that Devers is managing just a 57 wRC+ against left handed pitching this year, whereas Beltre sits at 116. A straight platoon could be used the rest of the way. With Christian Vazquez not due back before September, the team wouldn\u2019t even need to clear a roster spot to make this work. Tzu-Wei Lin could be optioned back to Pawtucket leaving a starting infield of Rafael Devers, Xander Bogaerts, Brock Holt, Mitch Moreland and Sandy Leon with Blake Swihart, Steve Pearce, Eduardo Nunez and Adrian Beltre on the bench until rosters expand. That\u2019s some impressive depth.If Dustin Pedroia makes it back before September, the Red Sox would have a difficult decision to make, but at this point it\u2019s getting a little tough to imagine that happening. What do you think about these rumors? Do you want to see Adrian Beltre back in Boston? Let us know in the comments!", "id": "516"}

In May, they guided lower for fiscal 2019 as well. Debt-to-capital has crept higher as cash levels have gone lower. Profit margins have gone the wrong way, as well. Oh, the Current Ratio looks okay, but this is a retailer, a mall-based retailer. Strip out inventories and the Quick Ratio... not so hot. In mid-July, the firm flat out told us that they had a lousy June. Tempting Dividend One thing has not changed. Every quarter, these guys still pay their shareholders $0.60 per share. The dividend yield is now up to 7.5%. Is it safe? As long as free cash flow is there, and it seems to be, I think for management, the dividend will be a line in the sand. You have time... I think. The eye is immediately drawn to Money Flow, which is awful. However, the daily MACD, and Relative Strength both show signs of recovery, as the name appears to have formed a double bottom. The Pitchfork might scare the stuffing out of you, but a Fibonacci model created with the same late-2017 start date actually offers some hope. Do I want to invest in L Brands? Not with the rent money. Is the name worthy of the mentioned above \"spec book\"? Perhaps. Especially if they leave that dividend alone.

What I am thinking of doing is called a \"buy-write.\"     For our new traders, all that mean is that the trader buys an equity stake, and simultaneously sells (writes) covered calls against the position, thus reducing net basis costs. Profit is then obviously limited, but then again, the trader will have technically bought the shares \"below the market.\" --Purchase 100 shares of LB at or close to the pre-opening last sale of $31.99. --Sell (write) 1 August 24 $34 call (last bid: $0.50). At these prices, this reduces the trader's net entry point to $31.49, while limiting the short-term profit to $2.51. If the shares never make it to $34 by expiration, you'll still likely get paid the $0.60 dividend, further reducing net basis to $30.89.

{"content": "It may not be the premiere date Thrones fans have been craving, but at least it\u2019s confirmation that the wait for closure won\u2019t be THAT long.Here\u2019s a tease of epic proportions, Game of Thrones fans.HBO President Casey Bloys was on hand at TCA to discuss what\u2019s happening at the cable network in 2018 and beyond. While he wouldn\u2019t say much about Thrones, the information he did drop is tantalizing enough to tide fans other for the time being.\u201cI\u2019m not going to say what to expect [in the final season], through it\u2019s pretty great,\u201d he said, according to Deadline. Cool. Thanks for that.But he wasn\u2019t done! Though he wouldn\u2019t divulge a concrete premiere date, he was able to offer something of value: Season 8 will premiere \u201csometime in 2019 \u2026 first half.\u201dSo there you have it, Thrones fans. You will finally learn who lives, who dies and who tells their story sometime between January and June 2019. It\u2019s not worth speculating further about specific dates, though the smart money is on it showing up some time in the spring like it used to before its production became more daunting and expensive.Bloys also discussed the potential Game of Thrones spinoffs, specifically the confirmed one that is currently being written by Jane Goldman and George R. R. Martin himself. According to the same Deadline report, Bloys shot down rumors that the show would start production in October, but said that of the proposed prequels, \u201cThat was the one we\u2019re excited about.\u201dApparently the other four prequel concepts are, according to Bloys, either not happening or being considered further, though he wouldn\u2019t specify which ones fit into each category.Let\u2019s worry about why Tyrion was lingering outside Dany\u2019s quarters before we start worrying about any other Thrones-related television content.", "id": "518"}

{"content": "The New York Rangers need leaders during this rebuild. Bringing back one of their most beloved leaders past this year would be huge for them going forward.It took just one trade deadline of being sellers for New York Rangers fans to program their brains into automatically trading all their expiring contracts. The team did this in 2018 by dealing Nick Holden, Rick Nash and Michael Grabner before they all left for nothing without even considering a potential future partnership.While those made sense, this offseason, the Rangers will most likely have another batch of players to do this with.It appears that Kevin Hayes is heading towards signing an arbitrator-fought one-year contract that will allow him to be an unrestricted free agent next July 1. Ryan Spooner appears to be heading down that route as well.The only other roster player of significance who will be heading to unrestricted free agency next July is Mats Zuccarello.After posting 61 and 59 points in 2015-16 and 2016-17, respectively, the diminutive wing only managed to notch 53 points in 2017-18. Lots of folks attributed it to a slight decline \u2014 Zuccarello did lack consistency at lots of times \u2014 but it could also be attributed to a broken system and environment, with AHL depth pieces taking NHL roster spots because of injuries or trades.Because of this, folks want to trade Zuccarello off ASAP.I\u2019m here to tell you that the Rangers are probably better off signing him to a contract extension unless some team offers them a deal that would constitute as an insane offer.The Norwegian forward will be turning 31 in September, so he has a few years left at the top of his game. The Rangers are also turning into one of the younger teams in the league.Just like Jeff Gorton said a while ago, the team can\u2019t be just 19 and 20 year olds going forward.They need some veteran voices in the room, and Zuccarello is one of those voices that can teach them the most, especially considering how many prospects the team has from Europe.The Rangers are going to have the cap space to extend him to a fair deal rather easily. Zuccarello took the hometown discount last time around, so he\u2019ll probably earn around $5-$5.5 million a year in his new deal. The Rangers could definitely give him that for three years and both sides would probably be very happy.Zuccarello is the third longest-tenured Ranger on the team behind Henrik Lundqvist and Marc Staal. His pride for the Blueshirt is the type of thing you want your young players to be influenced by.The Rangers have some time to test his market to see what\u2019s out there, but if it\u2019s nothing that blows their socks off, a contract extension is the best route they could take here.", "id": "520"}

{"content": "May the Atlanta Braves deadline deals commence.Late Monday night, about 16 hours before MLB\u2019s trade deadline, Atlanta Braves GM Alex Anthopoulos pulled off a deal to acquire slugging Cincinnati Reds outfielder Adam Duvall.Matt Wisler, Lucas Sims and Preston Tucker is the three-player return package going to Cincinnati in the trade.The initial takeaway from this trade is that it beefs up Atlanta\u2019s roster with some home-run ability. Duvall has clubbed 78 homers in the last 2.5 seasons with the Reds.The Atlanta Braves will definitely welcome the power potential that Duvall brings, as they currently sit with just 109 long balls on the year, good for 22nd in MLB.Atlanta has especially struggled this year with power from the right side of the plate, with most of the team\u2019s home runs coming from the left side.MLB.com\u2019s Mark Bowman suggests that Duvall could play in a part-time platoon role in left field.Anthopoulos will address the trade shortly. But in exchange for very little, the Braves gained an above-average outfielder who provides the chance for the to platoon Inciarte by having Acuna move to CF vs. LHPsThe Braves would be well-suited to consider Duvall in a platoon versus left-handed pitchers. Per Fangraphs, his season splits show a .769 OPS when facing lefties, compared to a .656 OPS against right-handers.The acquisition of Duvall aids the Braves in their current race with the Philadelphia Phillies in the National League East, and it came at a fairly insignificant cost.Both Matt Wisler and Lucas Sims were either blocked at the major-league level or passed in the pecking order by the host of young, emerging prospect arms in the Atlanta farm system.Preston Tucker provided a bit of pop to Atlanta\u2019s bench, but nothing to the extent of what the right-handed Duvall is capable of doing.One other positive from the trade for Atlanta is Duvall\u2019s contract; he is under team control through the 2021 season, providing Atlanta with a power-hitting outfield piece for the years to come.For the Reds, Wisler and Sims are solid change-of-scenery candidates, as it appeared though they were never going to make an impact in Atlanta in 2018 or the future.But overall, this appears to be a pretty shrewd move by Anthopoulos. The Atlanta Braves, in the thick of a playoff hunt, added much-needed power to its roster and did so without dealing from its top prospects.What else does Anthopoulos have in store, if anything?

{"content": "July 30--The bucket-wearing fan injured by falling debris from the Wrigley Field centerfield scoreboard last week said he's fortunate the Cubs were losing at the time.Had he not been wearing the plastic bucket on his head as a Cubs \"rally cap,\" Kyle McAleer believes he might have been killed.\"Absolutely,\" he said. \"It's purely speculation, but the way it hit me. ... If the Cubs weren't losing I would not have been wearing that bucket. It might've fractured my skull. It definitely could've been fatal. I am extremely lucky.\"McAleer was sitting with family and friends under the old centerfield scoreboard during a Cubs-Diamondbacks game on July 24, the day before his 20th birthday. When Kyle Hendricks gave up three runs in the top of the fifth inning, McAleer said it was time for him and his dad and friend to put on the \"rally\" buckets, which actually were empty bubble gum containers purchased a few years earlier from a Sam's Club.After the bottom of the fifth, a loose, 6- to 8-inch metal \"pin\" that holds the score tiles in place fell down from the scoreboard and struck McAleer in the head.\"I wouldn't be surprised if all the people in the bleacher heard that loud thud,\" he said.McAleer said there was \"considerable pain, but (it was) more shocking than anything else\" because his ears were ringing.The impact forced the bucket downward and knocked his glasses off. He first thought someone had thrown a bottle at him, before he saw blood rushing down from a laceration right above his hairline.The Cubs' medical team responded quickly, and McAleer was sent to Illinois Masonic Hospital for treatment. He said he was conscious all along and documented the incident on his Snapchat account.The Cubs confiscated the pin, which he estimated weighed about 3 to 4 pounds.McAleer was released around 11:30 p.m. and went back to his hometown of Scranton, Iowa, the next day. The cracked bucket that may have saved his life still has blood on it and is sitting on a shelf in his house.\"It's amazing, the coincidence,\" he said. \"That scoreboard has been around 81 years and this is the first time this has ever happened. And it just happened to fall on the kid wearing a plastic bucket on his head?\"I mean, what are the odds, man? I'm dumbfounded. I think about it and I've just got to stop and go 'Wow, man.' \"McAleer's biggest regret, he said, was having to miss the seventh inning stretch.Cubs spokesman Julian Green said last week the incident resulted from \"a loose pin that rolled out of the scoreboard when the tile was being changed,\" adding \"there are no loose pins and the scoreboard is secure.\"The Cubs did not respond to messages on Monday.After the news broke, many were confused as to why McAleer was wearing a bucket on his head. He confirmed the containers were a tribute to \"rally cap\" bubble gum buckets worn on the head by former Cub Starlin Castro and other players during celebration during the 2015 season.McAleer has since been in contact with the Cubs, who gave him some gifts, including a new Addison Russell jersey. He praised the quick response by the Cubs, and said there's been no decision about legal action down the road.\"If it was any other injury than a head injury, chances are this would've already been settled,\" he said. \"But the fact it was a head injury, and there's still a definite possibility I could suffer concussion symptoms within a couple weeks or months after the incident ...\"I still have multiple doctor visits. I've got to get the staples removed, I've got to get a second opinion on my head.

{"content": "Aug. 03--The Bears' exhibition opener Thursday was a tease for anyone hoping to see anything resembling what Matt Nagy's team will look like in the Sept. 9 season opener against the Packers.Twenty-seven players understandably were held out of the 17-16 loss to the Ravens in the Hall of Fame Game in Canton, Ohio. The night, then, amounted to an early August exercise in filling cracks at the bottom of the roster.Here are five observations from rewatching the NBC telecast.1. Isaiah Irving and Kylie Fitts were disruptive enough to generate optimism about the edge-rush depth.Let's be clear: Neither was rushing against the caliber of blocker he would face in a regular-season game. The Ravens rested their top guys just as the Bears did. But all Irving and Fitts could do was win the matchup in front of them, and there were some encouraging plays.Each had one of the Bears' eight sacks, but the most impressive flash was Irving's strip-sack that was negated by his offside penalty. Because he jumped into the neutral zone on Robert Griffin III's hard count and then tried to get back onside, Irving was actually going away from the quarterback when the ball was snapped.Ravens undrafted rookie left tackle Randin Crecelius set with his hands low, which Irving exploited by swatting downward. That got him on the edge of the block, and Irving did a terrific job to bend the corner and burst to Griffin.Yes, the penalty was a lapse of focus. But the one-on-one blocking win, albeit against relatively weak competition, is something to take forward as the Bears try to figure out their outside linebacker rotation.Irving was unblocked on his sack on third-and-goal from the 5 because the running back ran into the left tackle, setting a pick that Irving used to get home without being touched. There's not a lot to take away from that one from a technique standpoint.Another positive play for Irving: his stop of Griffin on a zone-read option keeper at the start of the second quarter. Griffin had Irving in a bit of space and tried a spin move, but Irving was patient and closed down the space to stop Griffin for a gain of 2 yards.On Fitts' sack, he beat tight end Nick Keizer, who's listed sixth and last on the Ravens depth chart. OK, that's not regular-season-caliber competition, but the sixth-round draft pick won the block in front of him with superior hand placement. Keizer didn't have his hands up, which allowed Fitts to get his hands into the tight end's chest and bull rush him back. Fitts quickly shed the block and finished the sack.Fitts too was flagged for being offside on a play. But in terms of the pass rush, the first half offered something on which to build.2. Receiver Javon Wims has an attractive combination of length, hands and speed.The seventh-round pick showed -- on the national stage against inferior competition -- what has been evident in spurts during training camp. He's a friendly target because of his length, ball skills and competitiveness on contested catches, and he's sneaky fast after the catch. Wims ran a 4.53-second 40-yard dash at the scouting combine in February -- which is OK for a 6-foot-3, 215-pounder -- and appears to play with effective football speed.He lined up at times Thursday in the slot and on the outside. His first catch was a 7-yard reception from the slot on which he freed himself from the linebacker with a hard step to the outside before breaking in. That was a sign of being route savvy, a focus of his practice work. He then caught the ball in traffic, one of several contested catches. Being able to catch the ball over the middle is a valuable trait, one that Kevin White, for example, is still working to master.On Wims' 17-yard catch-and-run at the end of the third quarter, he was on the ground when quarterback Tyler Bray released the pass. Catching it while in the process of getting to his feet required great concentration, and Wims showed off his burst by running for 13 yards.His 24-yard reception on the next play on a back-shoulder jump ball was one of the highlights of the night. Shades of Alshon Jeffery there. OK, let's not get carried away.Wims' shortcoming in camp has been drops, and he had one on third-and-6 late in the fourth quarter with the Bears driving to try to tie the game. The ball got on him quickly during an in-cutting route on which the defensive back was very handsy. Tough catch? Yes. One that would help Wims make the team? Absolutely. To Wims' credit, he converted on fourth-and-6 on the next snap.The Bears are expected to keep at least six receivers. Allen Robinson, Taylor Gabriel, Anthony Miller and White account for four of those spots. With special teams contributions needed from the group, pencil in Josh Bellamy for a spot.Of course, the Bears aren't stocked well enough to leave out any receiver who contributes to the passing game, so Wims can carve out his place by being consistent. Let's see if his performance Thursday earned him an opportunity to play against better competition in upcoming exhibitions.3. Officials must establish some consistency enforcing the helmet-contact rule.To be clear, some of the 15-yard penalties Walt Coleman's crew called were for hitting defenseless receivers, although he didn't explain that clearly on every call. Still, the new rule prohibiting contact initiated by the helmet was a factor, particularly in the first half.Some of the calls were obvious, but there were other times when a penalty was warranted and not called. For example, a Ravens defender led with his helmet while running into Bray on an incompletion on the Bears' last possession. That was an obvious penalty, and not just under the new rule. It should've been a flag for a head shot against the quarterback.League and game officials must use the preseason to closely evaluate how the rule is being enforced and strive for consistency. That's going to be the most frustrating part of how this affects games.It's like a baseball umpire calling balls and strikes: Hitters just want consistency so they know what's what. The same applies to this rule. There needs to be a clear standard. The stakes are too high for there not to be. Those 15-yard penalties alter drives, which can directly affect the outcome. Hopefully Thursday night is just a starting point.4. Coach Matt Nagy passed a minor game-management test.Nagy's first time overseeing the entire operation didn't produce many telling moments. There weren't key replay or clock-management decisions, even though it was a one-possession game. (Nagy does deserve major props for going for two late in the fourth quarter instead of playing for overtime in an exhibition game.)One game-management decision did stand out: Nagy's choice to accept a 5-yard penalty against the Ravens for ineligible man downfield with 19 seconds left in the first half.The Ravens had completed a pass to the Bears 47 to set up fourth-and-1. If Nagy had declined the penalty, the Ravens would've gone for it. The yardage was more important than the down, and Nagy recognized that.It's worth noting the Bears used their final timeout after both teams lined up to run the ensuing third-and-16 from the Ravens 38. After the game, Nagy told reporters he called timeout so the Bears could try to get the ball back, but the clock wasn't running because of the penalty. That explanation needs its own explanation.5. The interception Chase Daniel intended for Dion Sims exemplifies the offense's growing pains.Daniel and Sims obviously expected each other to do something different. Sims ran a short route underneath, turned to face Daniel but then drifted toward the sideline -- away from nearby linebacker Kamalei Correa. Daniel threw to where Sims had stopped, and the linebacker caught it.Particularly noteworthy about the misunderstanding is that it occurred between a quarterback who is well-versed in Nagy's offense and the first-string Y tight end. If a starter and knowledgeable backup quarterback are breaking down on a simple pass, it's a good indication a lot of work remains for the offense.rcampbell@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "524"}
{"content": "Earlier this month, Daimler (DDAIF) and auto parts supplier Bosch announced that they are teaming up with Nvidia (NVDA) to build a fleet of autonomous cars. Sound familiar? While many consumers are still contemplating whether self-driving robo-taxis and autonomous cars will occupy the roads during their lifetimes, tech and auto firms are rapidly adapting the technology. Be it General Motors (GM) , Ford (F) , Alphabet's (GOOGL) (GOOG) Waymo or Uber.  When the partnership was announced, it came as little surprise to us at TheStreet. At this year's Detroit Auto Show, we met separately with both Mercedes U.S. CEO Dietmer Exler (Daimler is the parent company) and Nvidia's senior director of automotive Danny Shapiro. We obviously talked about a lot of different things -- ranging from product mix in the U.S. with Mercedes and how close we are to fully autonomous driving with Nvidia. But one thing that overlapped in our discussions? Mercedes' MBUX infotainment system. This bad boy is an A.I.-powered system like you've never seen before. It enhances the elevated user experience you get from a company like Mercedes that's powered by a tech-juggernaut like Nvidia. This is not a \"puff piece\" - but this work of art is not only incredibly functional, it's gorgeous. I wouldn't be surprised to see all high-end infotainment systems migrate in this direction over the next few years. All of this is to say that with a leading tech company like Nvidia teaming up with \"the best or nothing\" Mercedes, the two companies working together on autonomous driving didn't come as a shock to us when the news hit the wires earlier this month.  You know when you're somewhere really nice and you're afraid to touch/move/do anything? Sort of like that \ufffd\ufffd (note: that screen goes all the way across \ufffd\ufffd) pic.twitter.com/MEpPS0qZcv \u2014 Bret Kenwell (@BretKenwell)  January 18, 2018  Self-Driving in Silicon Valley Is Just the Start As it stands, the trio plans to start testing the service in a yet-to-be-determined city near Silicon Valley. Given Mercedes' R&amp;D location in Sunnyvale and Nvidia's Santa Clara headquarters, the location of this service is again no surprise. In the bigger picture, Bosch, Daimler and Nvidia are looking at a larger rollout of the service in \"the beginning of the next decade.\" However, just this week Daimler announced it will adopt a new corporate structure. Shareholders will vote on the restructuring almost a year from now, in May 2019 at the next annual meeting. \"The new structure involves re-assigning more than 700 subsidiaries in over 60 countries. With this new structure, we will sharpen our focus, increase entrepreneurial responsibility and protect our synergies and economies of scale,\" said board member and head of finance Bodo Uebber. However, it's how the company is restructuring that caught our eye. Daimler will break into three groups: Mercedes-Benz AG, Daimler Truck AG and Daimler Mobility AG. That last one - Daimler Mobility AG - would suggest that Daimler management has much larger plans for its mobility and mobility-as-a-service efforts than just launching a few robo-taxi services across the country in a few years.  Assuming shareholders approve, it will be a while before this restructure takes place. But given Nvidia's role with Mercedes so far, it looks like the company could be on the receiving end of some big autonomous driving orders next decade. If Mercedes makes as big of a push into mobility, autonomous driving and A.I. features as it appears it will, Nvidia is one great way investors can play it. While it's hard to tie a timetable or revenue figure to the potential at this point, keep in mind that Daimler is no small player in the auto business.

( Engin Akyurt | Pixabay )A woman is suing a California hospital after doctors performed an emergency C-section on her without anesthesia. What happened during her childbirth ordeal?Emergency C-SectionIn the morning of Nov. 15, 2017, then 25-year-old Delphina Mota went to the hospital to induce her labor. She was alert and awake and requested for epidural to manage her pain during a consultation with the doctors.She was given the epidural at around 11 p.m., and Pitocin augmentation began less than 30 minutes later, but it caused her blood pressure to drop so it was discontinued. Hours later at around 5:20 a.m., doctors could no longer read the fetal heart rate, so they decided to perform an emergency C-section less than five minutes later.However, the anesthesiologist allegedly did not respond even after multiple pages, so the doctors proceeded with the emergency C-section even without the anesthesia.Strapped Down To The TableAccording to the lawsuit, Mota's four extremities were strapped down onto the operating table, and the doctors proceeded with the C-section operation, which entailed cutting through her abdomen, skin layers, muscles, and lower uterine segment. Although she was given an epidural earlier to numb her from the waist down, this was a part of their original plan, which was for a natural childbirth, and had no effect whatsoever on the surgical site on her abdomen.\"All of the sudden, I felt cutting on my stomach ... a burning sensation,\" Mota said of the incident. Through the process, Mota was said to be crying and screaming at the top of her lungs that she could feel everything, pleading for help, and begging the doctors to stop cutting her. She later passed out from the pain.Her fianc\u00e9, who was in the hallway outside the operating room during the process, stated that he knew there was something wrong when he heard the screams.LawsuitThe couple is now suing the hospital as well as the doctors involved in the incident for medical malpractice, loss of consortium, assault and battery, and negligent infliction of emotional distress. The doctors declined to comment, and the hospital released a statement wherein they note how patient health and quality are their top priorities but also declined to comment further on the case.\"I understand why they did it,\" said Mota. \"But this is a hospital ... There should have been measures in place.\"The baby delivered that day, a girl they named Cali, is now over 7 months old and is said to be doing well.", "id": "526"}

{"content": "In his second year as the Longhorns\u2019 head coach, can Tom Herman put Texas football back among the best of college football in 2018?Texas football is one of the best programs in the history of college football. With four national titles, 58 All-Americans and ranking second in all-time wins, the Longhorns are synonymous with greatness.However, after the departure of Mack Brown at the end of the 2013 season, the Longhorns posted a 16-21 record from 2014-2016. The program was going through one of its worst three-year spans in almost 30 years.Fortunately, a little hope was restored back into the program last season as the Longhorns finished 7-6, their first winning season since Brown left. Now, one win above .500 doesn\u2019t seem like much but it\u2019s the step in the direction for a team trying to find its old identity.Now in his second year as head coach, Tom Herman hopes to not only put the Longhorns back among the best of college football but to keep them there.

(Photo by Tim Warner/Getty Images)There were a few key losses that never should\u2019ve happened for Texas football last season, and the team gets a second shot at redemption in 2018.Texas football had a final record that is still disappointing by the usual program standards. Yet, given the record that the Longhorns posted throughout the era with Charlie Strong at the helm, the seven wins managed last season wasn\u2019t all that bad. The expectations for the Horns are much higher than they were a year ago.Entering the second year under the tenure of head Texas football coach Tom Herman, this program is expected to be a true contender in the picture for the Big 12 Championship. If nothing else, Texas should be in the top three or at least top five of the conference standings by the end of the regular season.The Big 12 doesn\u2019t have as many clear top 15 teams as it did entering the 2017 campaign. Strong football programs like the Oklahoma Sooners, TCU Horned Frogs, and Oklahoma State Cowboys all lose the starting quarterbacks from last season.Ample opportunity is there for the Horns to make a significant leap up the Big 12 standings and continue to improve beyond the seven win mark. For the past four seasons, seven wins was the best the Horns could muster. Double-digit wins is the next goal in mind.To do that, Texas needs to flip the script on a few of the six teams it lost to last season. In fact, every team that the Horns were defeated by last year are on the schedule again in 2018.Here\u2019s a look at the three 2017 losses for the Texas Longhorns that should turn into wins in 2018.", "id": "529"}
{"content": "A coach is indispensable to the serious athlete \u2014 everyone from Olympians to up-and-coming youth athletes needs experts who can spot the strengths and weaknesses of an athlete\u2019s style and cater to their personal needs. But now AI systems are almost sophisticated enough to do the job just as well as \u2014 better in some ways \u2014 than the old human experts.HomeCourt, an iPhone app that basketball players can use to track their shots, might be the first of its kind. If the phone\u2019s camera is propped up and aimed at them while they practice, the app will track the position and success rate of each throw. As The Wall Street Journal reported, the free app offers users real-time feedback, complete with an automatically-spliced video recording of every single shot the athlete takes so they can check their form. At least, it does for 300 shots per month \u2014 more than that, and a user is prompted to pay $8 for a subscription.There are other apps that coaches and athletes use, of course. Coach\u2019s Eye, for instance, lets athletes review and annotate their footage. But while many of them help athletes film themselves, none use AI to help improve performance. Without an expert there to review the footage, these athletes may not even know what they\u2019re looking for.HomeCourt isn\u2019t yet as sophisticated as a real-life human coach \u2014 right now, the app\u2019s AI gets confused if there\u2019s more than one person on the court. But David Lee, the Co-Founder and CEO of NEX Team, the company behind HomeCourt, is optimistic for how AI will be able to serve athletes in the future.\u201cIn the future, we believe we can provide a platform where coaches and trainers can be actively training and coaching their players through the app from anywhere, anytime,\u201d Lee told Futurism. He added that some athletes are already using HomeCourt to work remotely with their coaches when one of them is on the road. That way, athletes can get feedback from coaches based on what the AI saw during a solo practice session.HomeCourt\u2019s AI, rudimentary as it might be, represents an important first step. Artificial intelligence and apps \u2014 cheap compared to the elite coaches that kids are expected to hire if they want to break into travel leagues or thrive in a highly-competitive sport \u2014 could democratize the way that people can train and improve.HomeCourt\u2019s AI, rudimentary as it might be, represents an important first step. Artificial intelligence and apps could democratize the way that people can train and improve.In the future, Lee plans to make the app capable of new measurements so it can glean even more about a player, some of which a human coach can\u2019t readily discern. For basketball players, HomeCourt would look for things like jump height, speed, and release time, and analyze how each factor plays a role in an athlete\u2019s accuracy.\u201cFrom the data, we can extract what shooting form has the highest consistency and success specifically for you,\u201d says Lee. \u201cThe idea here is not to identify the perfect shot, but your perfect shot.\u201dHe also hopes to bring the HomeCourt\u2019s level of analysis to other sports. Tennis might be a natural next step, since the court is similarly marked with clear lines that help the AI gauge where people are standing. But other sports and activities may see AI coaches in the near future as well. Even some unconventional ones like yoga.\u201cWe can track a person\u2019s poses for something like downward dog and provide instant feedback about adjustments to help a yogi improve their poses,\u201d says Lee. \u201cSimply seeing ourselves doing yoga along with actionable insights could revolutionize yoga since most people don\u2019t currently get any feedback about their poses and how they can improve.\u201dWhile having your smartphone film you while you stretch and balance may ruin yoga\u2019s relaxing elements for some, AI could be a great learning tool for the many yoga practitioners who only do yoga at home, instructed by a video. Once people get the fundamentals down, they would presumably be able to unplug and enjoy yoga\u2019s meditative side.Whether or not HomeCourt (or a similar AI system) reaches a given sport, it\u2019s clear that sports technology is becoming more sophisticated than ever before. Athletes and coaches have access to an incredible amount of analytics and data, which helps them find more specific ways to improve their games in ways that wouldn\u2019t have been imaginable in the past. The key to improving sports through AI, of course, is to make sure that these technologies are available to everyone. Otherwise, tools like HomeCourt will only help the privileged few who already had access to the best tools.While the premium membership to HomeCourt isn\u2019t unaffordable for most, it\u2019s yet another subscription to keep track of. Meanwhile, the price tags for other advanced sports technology can easily climb into the triple digits, or even higher.It\u2019s easy to wonder whether these high-tech systems can really deliver on the promise to bring competitive sports to people who have been historically priced out. Until more competitors arrive to the artificial intelligence coaching space, we may have to wait and see.While one can\u2019t expect one company like HomeCourt to solve the problems of wealth inequality in sports, what we can all hope is increased outreach to make sure that those who would actually benefit from smarter sports tech actually get to use it.", "id": "530"}

It was revealed today that he played all of last year with an injured shoulder.Mack apparently hurt it during training camp last year and played through the pain the entire season. He had surgery in the offseason as soon as last year concluded and is now good to go. He says his shoulder feels much better, and he is at full strength.Playing through an injury is always a tough thing for players to do. But this particular injury had to have been hard to play through. As a running back, you are constantly lowering your shoulders as you run through holes. You take a beating on that part of your body.For Mack to be able to deal with the punishment on that injured shoulder and be as effective as he was is very impressive. Now the Colts have an exciting prospect. Mack was very good with an injury; imagine how much better he will be now that he is completely healthy.Mack was handed the keys to the backfield once Frank Gore left. So now Mack is the unquestioned starter and will get a larger role within the offense.

The bottom line is, the coordinators did a terrible job with the talent they had, and as a result, guys who dominated the past few seasons put up pedestrian years.The entire coaching staff has been overhauled for 2018, and you should see some better seasons out of guys like Derek Carr, Amari Cooper, and Marshawn Lynch. New head coach Jon Gruden has proven to be a quarterback guru over his coaching career, and it will only benefit the development of Carr going into his fifth season as the team\u2019s starting quarterback.While the passing statistics are a given, if Carr can stay healthy, we will not dive into those in this piece. Instead, we will focus on the guys catching and running the ball on offense, as well as those making big plays happen on the defensive side of the ball.Heck, we will even dabble in the special teams, where the Raiders should be improved over last season as well.

{"content": "Aug. 01--Utah is the first team in the conference to open the regular season and the first in the South to start training camp.What constitutes a successful camp?That depends on the depth chart, of course, but the Hotline figured a dash of context might be in order.(North division preview coming later this morning.)*** ArizonaBest case: If Khalil Tate stays away from Twitter (it's only downhill from here) and stays in the pocket; right tackle Thiyo Lukusa (ex-Michigan State) plays like an elite Big Ten recruit; the linebackers are as good as the Hotline advertised; former safety Dane Cruikshank's name is rarely mentioned; and the stadium renovation remains on schedule.Worst case: If tailback JJ Taylor is less than 100 percent when game week arrives; the backup quarterback situation remains muddled; Justin Belknap and Co. look wobbly on the defensive front; safety Scottie Young's situation becomes a distraction; and a whiff of controversy surfaces ... from the basketball program.Sumlin's mouth to our ears: \"When you're the back-up quarterback, it's really kind of a cool position because you've really got nothing to lose when you go in. You don't get yanked. You just go back to where you were, right? So there is a little different pressure when you're a starter, and it comes with the things that are expected of you. Not just on the field, but off the field and on the sideline. So that growth is taking place because as great as his numbers are, he's really a young player.\"My brain to this keyboard: Aside from a handful of positions on the offensive line, the Wildcats are in solid shape across the depth chart. Combine the quarterback, defense and schedule, and Sumlin stepped into a good situation. The Wildcats should be in Week Three form in Week One.Opener: Sept. 1 vs Brigham Young*** Arizona StateBest case: If the new offensive linemen, especially LT Casey Tucker (ex-Stanford), are ready to contribute pronto; a backup tailback surfaces; nobody gets cut from the roster (at least with the cameras rolling); the defense grasps the basics of coordinator Danny Gonzales' 3-3-5 scheme; and Michigan State suffers a chicken pox outbreak that lasts through the second Saturday in September.Worst case: If quarterback Manny Wilkins stagnates; linebacker Koron Crump and cornerback Chase Lucas feel like they're playing 2-on-11; anything happens to tailback Eno Benjamin or receiver N'Keal Harry; and Herm Edwards loses his voice after 200-something interviews this offseason.Edwards' mouth to our ears: \"70% of your day a lot of times is spent on recruiting. It's a year-round process. I never would have imagined, and I've been in college football before -- I've been recruited as a college athlete -- that the degree of recruiting now. You're talking about 2020 kids. We already are looking at 2020 kids. I'm going, Really, 2020? How do you make a decision on a 2020 kid?\"My brain to this keyboard: New offensive line, new defensive line, new defensive playbook, new culture ... and precious little time to learn with San Diego State, Michigan State and Washington in the first month. No team has more to accomplish in camp than the Sun Devils.Opener: Sept. 1 vs. UTSA*** ColoradoBest case: If tailback Travon McMillian (ex-Virginia Tech) loosely resembles Phillip Lindsay; the offensive line produces an upside surprise after the disappointing '17 season; defensive linemen Javier Edwards and Chris Mulumba are impact players consistently; and freshman cornerback Chris Miller plays like a veteran.Worst case: If quarterbackSteven Montez isn't sharp; the young wideouts aren't consistent (the Buffs lost their top-three receivers); and coach Mike MacIntyre doesn't see a few of the same traits that were visible in Aug. '16, when CU was quietly positioning itself for a breakout season.MacIntyre's mouth to our ears: \"(Montez) has gone from algebra to calculus in understanding how to prepare for a game, his film study and all the things he's doing. He's been around the office all summer, watching tape, working on it, studying it. And Kurt Roper, our new quarterback coach, has done a great job with him.\"My brain to this keyboard: We won't begin to speculate on CU's effectiveness on the lines of scrimmage -- too many new players, too little game experience -- but the Hotline would be surprised if Montez doesn't thrive under Roper's tutelage. Sometimes, a different voice can change everything.Opener: Aug. 31 vs. Colorado State*** UCLABest case: If the defensive line solidifies around Chigozie Nnoruka; someone emerges at quarterback not named Dorian Thompson-Robinson (so he can redshirt); tight end Caleb Wilson's forefoot remains sturdy; and edge rusher Jaelen Phillips shows off the form that made him the most coveted prospect in the class of '17.Worst case: If Devon Modster plays like a backup quarterback, Wilton Speight plays like a starter ... at Michigan Tech; the defense allows 287.4 rushing yards per practice; the offensive line is as mediocre as expected; and Chip Kelly banishes the Bruins to San Bernardino.Kelly's mouth to our ears: \"If we're going to be successful at UCLA, it really starts on the defensive side of the ball. One thing that people don't realize' or maybe just kind of glossed over, is when we were really good at Oregon is because we were really good on defense.\"My brain to this keyboard: Player development was lacking (woefully so) in Westwood under the previous coaching staff. Expect that to change (markedly so) under the current staff: Kelly and his assistants will get the most out of the talent, however much exists.Opener: Sept. 1 vs. Cincinnati*** USCBest case: If JT Daniels plays like Matt Barkley as a rookie, Matt Fink plays like Sam Darnold as a rookie, or none of the quarterbacks play like a rookie; the offensive line avoids serious injury; a cornerback emerges opposite Iman Marshall and a safety emerges opposite Marvell Tell; and playcaller Tee Martin thrives on a staff that has only one coach named Helton.Worst case: If Daniels plays like a teenager; tailback Stephen Carr (surgically-repaired back) runs like an octogenarian; the defense is anything less than stellar; and if essential personnel, as often happens with all the distraction of Los Angeles, engages in off-the-field nonsense.Helton's mouth to our ears: \"We've got 25 practices. I'll name somebody (the starting quarterback) before the opening game. I don't have a crystal ball because I'm going to have to have time enough to allow the kids to compete and make the best decision for the football team. So I think it will be later than sooner.\"My brain to this keyboard: More than a few USC fans are undoubtedly wondering if Helton will pick the right quarterback (as opposed to his '16 decision). But if execution matches the talent at the other 21 spots, the Trojans would merely need decent QB play to control the South.Opener: Sept. 1 vs. UNLV*** UtahBest case: If quarterback Tyler Huntley improves his pocket efficiency; the young defensive backs play like veteran defensive backs; anything bad happens to BYU; receiver Britain Covey plays like he spent a two-year mission on the Patriots practice squad; and coach Kyle Whittingham only has to answer one question per day about never having won the South.Worst case: If the offense looks like it has a new playcaller (it shouldn't, because it doesn't); defensive tackles Pita Tonga and Leki Fotu don't look like Utah defensive tackles; the receivers prove their skeptics correct; and Chase Hansen is forced to return to safety because of concerns on the back line.Whittingham's mouth to our ears: \"We've had a chance to get to the championship game a couple times, have not capitalized on that opportunity. That's the next step of our evolution as a program ... I've heard it over and over: We're the only team in the South, since we joined the league, that hasn't gotten there. But we own up to that. We're not trying to hide from that.\"My brain to this keyboard: Considering the Utes have a veteran quarterback, four returning starters on the line, an established scheme and familiar playcaller, there should be no talk of the defense being ahead of the offense. In all other years, that's an acceptable state of affairs in SLC, but not now, not this month.Opener: Aug. 30 vs. Weber State------Why we need your support: Like so many other providers of local journalism across the country, the Hotline's parent website, mercurynews.com, recently moved to a subscription model.

{"content": "With a plethora of dynamic playmakers of all shapes and sizes on the team, here are three intriguing pick-and-roll options for the Philadelphia 76ers.Ah, the pick-and-roll, a basketball play that is just as effective as it is confusing, and when done correctly, can be virtually unguardable with the right combination of players.Used most recently to great effect by James Harden on the Mike D\u2019Antoni coached Houston Rockets, the pick-and-roll allows a guard to gain separation on the defender by having a big man, usually the center, set a screen to free up the ball handler. But unlike on a typical screen, the screener is just as involved as the player he\u2019s freeing up in determining the play\u2019s success.Once the ball-handler is free, both players drive at the basket, with the ball-handler having the choice of either taking a shot, dropping it off to his pick-and-roll partner, or passing the ball out to the wings for an open outside shot. In a lot of ways, a good pick-and-roll works like the read-option or run-pass option in the NFL. The play\u2019s designed to create a mismatch somewhere on the court, and depending on how a team decides to defend it, different shots will become higher percentage shots.Though the play isn\u2019t foolproof, it becomes a more effective tool when a better, smarter ball handler is running the show.Want your voice heard? Join the Section 215 team!One thing the Philadelphia 76ers have in spades is a slew of smart ball-handlers. From traditional point guards like T.J. McConnell and Markelle Fultz, to point forwards like Dario Saric and Ben Simmons, if Brett Brown decides to incorporate more pick-and-roll into his offense going into the 2018-2019 NBA season, he certainly has options.So as the 76ers to prepare to enter training camp in lieu of what could be their most important season in years, here are three potent potential pick-and-roll pairings that could make the Philadelphia 76ers offense that much more scary next season.", "id": "540"}

But however you read the city of Chicago's odor complaints, one thing is clear: The city stinks.This is never more apparent than on hot summer days.

What if we smelled without judgment, but with curiosity and a sense of discovery? What if, instead of scuttling down a rote set of streets on your daily rounds, you could smell your way to work?Scientists and researchers say you can -- which is why they're looking at how smells have shaped cities, and working to create smell maps of cities around the world.\"Smells form a significant component of human knowledge about local environments,\" says Kate McLean, program director in graphic design at Canterbury Christ Church University in the U.K., in an email interview. \"Smells act as markers of change (diurnal, seasonal ...), as ambiance and also act as personal markers of place-indexing activity. Smells are both a survival tool (smoke, escaping gas, burnt toast) and an element of emotional relationships with place (seaside, pine forests, souks).\"McLean is a smell collector, someone who routinely sticks her nose into, say, dog fur or a random hedge, just to catch a scent. She began studying smells as a part of an alternative way to know the city of Edinburgh, Scotland, while pursuing her Master of Fine Arts there. \"I started deconstructing the city through sensory approaches,\" she says, \"and representing the findings as maps which deliberately withheld information and encouraged the map reader to actively experience for themselves.\"Cities, she quickly realized, were a rich stew of smells.\"The first smells I was curious about were those encountered in the contemporary city. In the case of Edinburgh, they included brewery fumes, penguins at the zoo, fish and chip shops, cut grass, cherry blossom.\" McLean developed a method of \"smell walking\" (which includes both heavy sniffing and actually sticking your nose close to things to seek out smells) through city neighborhoods to document odors, then plotting that data on maps, which she presents in colorful, artistic renderings.Daniele Quercia, a scientist at Nokia Bell Labs in Cambridge, U.K., takes another approach to smell mapping.He and colleagues Luca Maria Aiello, also of Nokia Bell Labs, and Rossano Schifanella, a professor at the University of Turin, create smell maps of cities using data mining. Specifically, they use a set of words that have been recognized by scientists as language that humans use for smells, then cross-reference that with geolocated social media posts and come up with maps that tie reports of smells to physical streets, blocks and neighborhoods in cities around the world.On their website, goodcitylife.org, you can click on your Chicago street and get a nifty graphic that shows you the predominant smells people have reported at that location.\"There are devices which can measure particles in the air,\" says Quercia, \"but this is complementary. Devices give you a number, but what social media can give you is another layer to that number, an emotional reaction.\" So scientists will one day be able to know, for instance, the exact particle threshold of emissions from a factory that will tip the scale from \"Hmm, weird smell\" to \"That stench is searing my brain. Call somebody!\"The somebody on the other end of those calls in Chicago is Dave Graham, the city's assistant commissioner for environmental permitting and inspections. Graham's department investigates odor complaints made by citizens of our city -- sometimes as few as nine per month (in the winter) to more than 20 per month in the summer.Most of the calls are voicing concern about industrial smells: petroleum, chemicals, spray paint, smelly smoke billowing down an alleyway, sewer gas. City inspectors follow those complaints like smell detectives, trying to chase down the source and make sure there's no public health hazard or code violation.\"They're going to have to poke around, snoop around and figure out what's causing it,\" says Graham. \"Sometimes, these odors, you don't necessarily find the source.\" If it's a really tough case, Graham, who is a former environmental consultant, might have to come out and take a look himself, though he notes his own sense of smell is less than sensitive. \"The only thing that bothers me is my wife's hand lotion. I don't know why, but it drives me crazy.\"Many of the smells Graham's team investigates turn out to be \"more of a nuisance issue\" than a public danger, he notes. But smells and health concerns have been linked in the human mind for centuries. In fact, early worries about smells helped shape Chicago into the city it is today, says Melanie Kiechle, an urban smell historian and author of \"Smell Detectives: An Olfactory History of Nineteenth-Century Urban America.\"Kiechle chose Chicago as one of the major subjects of her research, she says, partly because \"Chicago definitely stunk.\" The rapid rise of the meatpacking industry in the city, combined with explosive urban growth that outstripped the capacity for public sanitation, created a ready environment for a world of heady scents. \"It was what we call a 'shock city'\" says Kiechle, \"and not just because its growth was a shock to the environment, but also because when people arrived, they were literally shocked by the conditions.\"Obviously, we had a long way to go before the architectural boat tour made the town safe for tourists.Nineteenth-century Chicagoans, Kiechle says, paid a lot of attention to smells. \"People believed that bad airs caused disease. They called them miasmas. And one of the ways they knew the air was bad was the way it smelled.\"Germ theory didn't rear its reasonable, scientific head until late in the 19th century, so Chicago's citizens had to rely on their noses to tell them that something nasty might be brewing. Then, as now, laws allowed for citizens to complain about public nuisances and ask the city to regulate industry to tamp down the smells. Eventually, after some political maneuvering and a whole lot of citizen complaints, the \"Stink Trials\" of the 1870s marked the first time courts ordered the regulation of powerful packing houses and fat renderers until they agreed to install odor controls.Odor, Kiechle says, also influenced another major historical moment: the decision to reverse the flow of the Chicago River. \"Today we think that it was to protect the city's drinking water,\" Kiechle says, \"and that was true, but they didn't understand that in the 19th century. In 1865, when the project was started, the point of redirecting the water flow was to direct the stench of the water away from the city.\"Basically, it worked: Today, on Quercia's smell map of Chicago, the predominant smell reported along the riverwalk is \"nature.\" Depending on how close you're standing to Lower Wacker Drive or Island Party Hut, the smell of nature might vary. But the beauty of tracking smells, Quercia says, is that you can choose which part of the riverwalk you'd prefer to walk down, based on scent. \"If you see that a certain street smells like the poo of dogs,\" he says, \"you might go another way.\"In the future, Quercia and his team hope that urban planners might be able to put their data to good use to make cities smell better and, since smells are closely tied into the emotional centers of the brain, even less stressful.\"If you are placing a bench for people to sit and relax,\" he says, \"maybe you want to include plants with a restful smell, like lavender.\" Until then, you can have a little fun by walking to the train by way of, say, baked goods rather than car emissions.Or, like McLean, you can start to explore the city via smells. She has created a downloadable smell walk kit, that explains how to use specific techniques to both passively and actively catch and document smells as you go. \"Participants leave with a new understanding of their city,\" she says.And maybe a little more acceptance. \"Odors are odors,\" says Graham. \"You're in the city, you're smelling maybe the restaurant on the corner, a car shop, a nail salon, whatever.\" On his own commute, he says, \"I pass one building, and every so often I catch a whiff of something really bad.\" Diagnosis? \"It's just the sewer. It might be something decomposing down there.\"Maybe he should map that.cdampier@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "541"}

{"content": "July 27--LAS VEGAS -- Someone here asked Harden how long it took him to get over the Rockets loss in the Western Conference Finals. But it was a trick question.\"It's on my mind every day,\" Harden said. \"Game 6, Game 7. That's what drives me every day.\"While the MVP hasn't forgotten, Houston's days as the Warriors' main threat are starting to feel like a distant memory. The reigning NBA champions raised the bar this off-season by adding All-Star center DeMarcus Cousins, who should be healthy by playoff time. The Rockets, meanwhile, lost two key role players to free agency, Trevor Ariza and Luc Mbah a Moute.\"It doesn't change anything,\" Harden said during the two-day Team USA mini-camp, which wrapped up Friday at UNLV. \"We already know what the Warriors can bring. Obviously, DeMarcus Cousins is very skilled and talented. But they're still the Warriors. They've won three out of the past four championships.\"We're right there. Last year we showed we were right there. We'll be right there this year as well.\"Ariza, who led the NBA in steal-to-turnover ratio (1.88), signed a one-year, $15 million deal with the Phoenix Suns. Mbah a Moute, a key reserve, got $4.6 million from the Los Angeles Clippers. Both helped fuel Houston's rapid improvement on defense as the Rockets went from No. 18 in defensive efficiency to No. 6 last year.Houston did re-sign restricted free agent center Clint Capela.\"You have to realize that was me and Chris (Paul's) first year together,\" Harden said. \"People were saying, 'Can they play together? Can they make it work?' We made it work. It was easy.\"Harden has a point. The Rockets went 42-3 when Harden, Paul and Capela played together. They outscored opponents by an average of 11.5 points in those games.It was Capela, who, after the Rockets beat the Warriors 116-110 on Jan. 20, all but declared a changing of the guard in the Western Conference: \"We are better than them.\" And for much of the year, including the Conference Finals, he was right. The Rockets earned the No. 1 seed with a franchise-record 65-17 regular season, and led the league in point differential (8.5 points per game).Dethroning the Warriors was the plan all along, as general manager Daryl Morey made clear on ESPN Radio in December: \"It's the only thing we think about. I think I'm not supposed to say that, but we're basically obsessed with, 'How do we beat the Warriors?'\"But did the Rockets miss their window? With Paul out because of a hamstring injury, the Rockets blew a 17-point lead in Game 6 before unraveling again in Game 7, when they went 1 for 21 from long range in the second half.That's what haunts Harden. That's what drives him.\"I try to work my butt off and try to mentally lock in as much as I can to get back to that feeling,\" he said. \"That feeling. You're right there. You're one half away. And then road blockage. You have to find a way to get past that road block. It was just too tough. We have to get back there.\"Getting back there could hinge on a resurgent performance from Carmelo Anthony, the 10-time All-Star, who is expected to sign as a free agent once he clears waivers. He averaged 16.2 points on 40.4 percent shooting (both career lows) for the Oklahoma City Thunder last season. Anthony will likely replace Ariza in the starting lineup.\"Everybody in the world knows what Carmelo brings, how gifted and talented he is,\" Harden said. \"He still has a lot more to go. If he comes to the Rockets, he'll bring the best out of us and I'm sure we'll bring the best out of us as well.\"Harrison Barnes, the former Warrior now with the Dallas Mavericks, agrees.\"The Rockets won 60-plus games last year,\" he said with a laugh. \"You're not going to tamper with that. They're a good team, regardless of losing Ariza and Moute. If they add Carmelo or anyone else, I think they have a system in place that makes them difficult to guard.\"Harden is coming off a season in which he joined Michael Jordan (1987-88) as the only players to average at least 30 points, 8 assists, 5.0 rebounds and 1.70 steals per game in a season. He became just the second Rocket (Elvin Hayes in 1968-69) to lead the league in scoring and the first since Moses Malone in 1981-82 to average at least 30 points a game.His reward? The Warriors added an All-Star center while the Los Angeles Lakers brought in LeBron James in hopes of putting together their own super team.\"Nothing changes, man,\" Harden said. \"The West is already a beast. So the Lakers got better, but they're still in the conference with the Warriors. So no matter how you look at it, you still have go through some beasts.\"-- The Warriors (five) have the most players in this 35-man pool for the USA National Team. Kevin Durant was the only one on the court, while Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green skipped this camp for personal time. Cousins arrived in Las Vegas but is still recovering from an a Achilles injury.___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "545"}
{"content": "July 27--Is the end near for MoviePass, the popular subscription movie-going service with more than 3 million subscribers?MoviePass experienced \"technical difficulties\" that prevented many subscribers from using the service Thursday, with its Twitter account saying it was related to its \"card-based check-in process.\"But the real reason for the technical difficulties? MoviePass ran out of money to buy tickets, according to an SEC filing its parent company made on Friday.The parent company, Helios and Matheson, then borrowed $6.2 million -- $5 million of which was cash -- from Hudson Bay Capital Management in order to restore its service. The $5 million cash was used to \"pay the company's merchant and fulfillment processors,\" the SEC filing said -- in other words, to buy the movie tickets subscribers order on the app.\"If the company is unable to make required payments to its merchant and fulfillment processors, the merchant and fulfillment processors may cease processing payments for MoviePass, Inc. (\"MoviePass\"), which would cause a MoviePass service interruption,\" wrote Helios and Matheson CEO Ted Farnsworth in the SEC filing. \"Such a service interruption occurred on July 26, 2018. Such service interruptions could have a material adverse effect on MoviePass' ability to retain its subscribers.\"Helios and Matheson issued a statement on Friday afternoon about the technical difficulties -- but did not address the loan or the cash shortage:\"We apologize for the inconvenience caused by a temporary outage in our app over the past day,\" said Helios and Matheson. \"We have handled the issues on the back-end, and our app is now up-and-running with stability at 100%. We thank our members and our community for their patience and ongoing support, and we appreciate their commitment to our vision as we revolutionize the movie industry. We've also posted a letter to subscribers on our social media channels and in our app communicating adjustments to the service and our plans for the future.\"The company's financial difficulties come as no surprise to many who have watched its business. Its three million subscribers pay a fixed amount per month -- currently the price is $9.95 -- in exchange for tickets to an unlimited number of movies. It doesn't take too many movie outings per user before MoviePass is losing money on a subscription. Still, the popularity of the service has rocked the movie theater industry, and many chains are offering their own subscription services, although none is as good a deal as MoviePass.News of Helios and Matheson's loan sent its stock price spiraling down Friday. When Friday's trading closed, Helios and Matheson's share price was at $2.00 -- more than 70 percent lower than when it opened.On Wednesday, Helios and Matheson completed a reverse stock split -- a move in which multiple shares are coalesced into a smaller number of shares -- to avoid being delisted from the stock exchange. On Tuesday's closing, Helios and Matheson's shares were at 8.5 cents; the Nasdaq stock exchange sometimes removes company shares from its exchange if they are below the $1 threshold for more than a month.With the reverse stock split, where every 250 shares in the company became one single share, Helios and Matheson's new share price would have been around $21. However, when Wednesday's trading began, Helios and Matheson shares immediately lost a third of its value, starting at $14.26.In two days since the reverse stock split, Helios and Matheson share prices have dropped 86 percent.___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "546"}

The man's body reacted aggressively with a rapid drop in blood pressure, causing circulation in his limbs to quickly decline. ( Pixabay )A 48-year-old man from Wisconsin lost all four limbs to amputation after contracting a rare blood infection that he most likely got from his own dog.The infection is a very rare one, with over 99 percent of people who own dogs never experiencing the problem. Unfortunately, the man is among the unlucky ones, and he paid an enormous price for it.Man Loses Limbs Due To CapnocytophagaGreg Manteufel, a dog lover who had a history of good health, found himself in the emergency room last month, thinking that he was just down with the flu.However, it was something far more sinister. Manteufel contracted an infection from bacteria known as capnocytophaga, which is found in the saliva of dogs. The bacteria, which may lead to severe infections in people who have weakened immune systems, is spread through close contact or bites from dogs that carry it.Manteufel's body reacted aggressively to the infection, which may result in blisters, redness or swelling, diarrhea, vomiting, muscle and joint pain, fever, and headaches.\"It hit him with a vengeance,\" said Mantefuel's wife, Dawn. \"Just bruising all over him. Looked like somebody beat him up with a baseball bat.\"Manteufel's body responded to the capnocytophaga infection with a rapid drop in blood pressure, causing circulation in his limbs to quickly decline. After a week, doctors started amputating his legs, followed by more surgeries to remove parts of his hand, and then half of both his forearms.Manteufel, however, has not lost his spirit throughout the ordeal.\"That's all he kept saying to the doctors -- 'take what you need but keep me alive.' And they did it. Surprisingly enough, they did do it,\" his wife Dawn said.A GoFundMe page has been set up by Manteufel's family, which was already near at $25,000 goal at the time of writing. In addition to the expensive amputation surgery, the money will be used to conduct extensive repairs on his nose, which was also affected by the bacteria and sepsis.No Need To Avoid DogsManteufel's case is a very rare one, so people should not stay away from dogs after discovering his bout with capnocytophaga infection.Dogs will always be man's best friend, and a recent study identified specific gestures that are used by dogs to communicate with humans. Fat dogs have even given scientists more insight on obesity, specifically on how dogs may be used as models for future research on the causes and psychological impact of the condition.", "id": "547"}
{"content": "July 26--Infielder David Bote wasn't in Triple-A Iowa's starting lineup Wednesday night at Fresno, raising the possibility he could be promoted to the Cubs if Kris Bryant is placed on the 10-day disabled list.Bote, 25, can play multiple positions and batted .310 in 42 at-bats with the Cubs before he was optioned to Iowa last week. With Iowa, Bote is batting .268 with 13 home runs and 41 RBIs.Meanwhile, manager Joe Maddon floated the idea Wednesday that using a six-man rotation makes lots of sense considering the Cubs' current stretch of 12 games in 11 days.Of course, the bigger question regarding an expanded rotation is who is most qualified to handle those duties, especially if the Cubs don't acquire a starting pitcher by Tuesday's 3 p.m. non-waiver trade deadline.Eddie Butler was activated from the 10-day disabled list Tuesday, but Butler might be better utilized as a long reliever until multiple starters show they can pitch deeper into games consistently. Butler has starting experience and pitched seven innings of four-hit ball in relief on March 30 at Miami, and he allowed one earned run in five innings against Triple-A Memphis in his final rehab start for Iowa.Luke Farrell pitched five scoreless innings in relief against the Mets on June 2, but he has struggled in two starts. Farrell has minor-league options, so he could stay in Iowa for a while.Jen-Ho Tseng is becoming a longer shot. He lasted only two innings in his only start for the Cubs on May 8, and Tseng has a 6.84 ERA in 19 starts at Iowa.An intriguing candidate is Duane Underwood Jr., who has experienced an inconsistent season at Iowa but showed promise during his lone major-league start at Dodger Stadium on June 25. Underwood, 24, threw four innings of two-hit ball and showed remarkable poise with his ability to work at a deliberate pace and mix a 94 mph fastball with a 78 mph curve.Much of the talk involving the use of a sixth starter may depend on Tyler Chatwood's ability to solve his bouts of wildness. As long as Chatwood struggles, the Cubs will need to look closer at the quality of their rotation rather than the quantity.Chatwood faces the Diamondbacks on Thursday in the final game of a four-game series.mgonzales@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "548"}
{"content": "If you're saving for retirement, it's quite possible you're using not ETFs nor mutual funds but something a collective investment trust or CIT. Consider this finding from the most recent Investment Company Institute report: \"More retirement plan sponsors have begun offering CITs as options in 401(k) plan lineups... this trend has translated into a growing share of assets held in CITs by large 401(k) plans. That share increased from 6% in 2000 to an estimated 19% in 2016. This recent expansion is due, in part, to the growth in target-date fund CITs.\" The ICI is not alone in witnessing the rapid growth of CITs in employer-sponsored retirement plans. \"The diversity of CITs is now almost as wide as mutual funds,\" says Scott Parry, a principal with Accumulas. \"And this this will only expand with more demand, and because CIT providers can create a new CIT by simply investing 100% of the proceeds of a CIT in any single mutual fund to create a CIT version of any mutual fund, with or without permission of the mutual fund company,\" he says. Below, Parry answers our questions about CITs. When can CITs be used?  Collective investment trusts are aptly named because to invest in a CIT, the investor must be a legal trust. Thus, 401(k) plans and defined-benefit plans are legally set up as trusts, with a company such as Reliance Trust usually acting as the trustee of the plan. \"Collective\" means that a CIT provider can allow multiple trusts to invest in the same CIT. A CIT is actually a trust itself, established for the benefit of investing other trust's assets in a certain specific investment style. So, the only way that an individual investor can invest in a CIT is though their employer's savings plan, either their 401(k) or their pension. What investments can be held in a CIT?  A CIT can hold just about any type of asset: stocks, bonds, mutual funds, commodities, derivatives, etc. The only limitation we found was that the counterparty (whatever financial institution that is holding the asset) must be within the jurisdiction of the United States federal courts in case there was a lawsuit brought against the institution. For instance, financial institutions that invest in foreign derivatives, where the counterparty is a non-US company, and it might be difficult to drag the counterparty into a US courtroom should someone want to sue them. That being said, a vast majority of CITs are actually holding the same stocks, bonds and mutual funds that any investor might buy on their own in their brokerage account. Who makes the investment decisions of a CIT?  The trustee of the CIT is on the hook for everything to do with the CIT, including deciding who is going to make the day-to-day investment decisions. Sometimes it is the trustee of the CIT themselves, but often they will hire a sub-adviser to pick the stocks or bonds that will be held in the CIT. When the trustee decides to own one or more mutual funds in a CIT, they are by default outsourcing the day-to-day investment decisions to the portfolio manager of the mutual fund(s). The trustee of the CIT would then only be responsible for deciding which mutual funds (and the allocation to each if more than one), although it is possible that the trustee would hire yet another investment professional to do that also. For instance, Reliance trust created such as a CIT with Envestnet. Reliance is the trustee of the CIT, but Envestnet makes the decisions on which mutual funds to include in the CIT, and the portfolio manager of the mutual funds then decides which stocks or bonds to purchase in their mutual fund. Why would a CIT version of a mutual fund benefit a plan participant as opposed to simply investing in the mutual fund directly, especially when there would be added expenses charged by the CIT provider?  There are a few situations where a CIT benefits the plan participant, especially for participants in a small 401(k) plan. Mutual funds have many costs embedded in them to cover the costs of running the fund. Many of the costs incurred by the fund company are because the typical investor in a mutual fund is an individual investor, and the mutual fund company must keep track of each individual, how much they have invested, how to distribute dividends to each investor, etc. All that accounting and all the shareholder communications is expensive to do. But when a 401(k) plan invests in a fund, even though the 401(k) plan is made up of hundreds or thousands of individuals, it looks like one investor to the mutual fund company, and only have to do all the accounting for the plan as one investor. Because they don't have to do as much work for a 401(k) plan as they would if each participant was \"fully disclosed\" to the mutual fund company, the mutual fund company is willing to provide discounts to a 401(k) plan that invests in their fund. Usually how they do this is to offer a different share class of the mutual fund that has a lower cost in exchange for the 401(k) plan agreeing to meet a certain investment minimum. These minimums are usually quite high, often in the millions, and most small 401(k) plans can't meet the minimums. So a CIT provider will create a CIT of a mutual fund, and pool many 401(k) plans together in the \"collective,\" so these smaller plans when pooled together in the CIT can meet the investment minimum and gain access to the lower-cost share class, which saves money for the plan participants over investing in the mutual fund directly. Since CITs are trusts and trusts are not regulated by the SEC, is there less regulation to protect CIT investors? No. As trusts, CITs are regulated by the bank regulators that oversee trusts, either the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency or a state banking regulator. In addition, when hiring a sub-adviser, the sub-advisers are almost always SEC registered investment companies or advisers. So in most cases a CIT is actually doubly regulated, first the trust itself is overseen and audited by their banking regulator, and then the investments and the investment advisers are overseen by the SEC. I want to invest in a balanced portfolio like a target-date fund? Can a CIT help me there? Yes, CITs are a great vehicle to create a better target-date fund (TDF) for a 401(k) plan. Most TDFs in a 401(k) plan are what we call \"proprietary\" TDFs. That means that one company, such as T. Rowe Price, manages the TDF by investing their TDF exclusively in their other single asset-class mutual funds. So, for instance, T Rowe Price's TDF invests in T. Rowe Price's Small Cap Fund, Large Cap Fund, International Fund and also one of their own bond funds. What they don't do is look for the best funds available in the market. So, despite the fact that there might be better and less expensive mutual funds available, all assets in the T. Rowe Price TDF are invested in T. Rowe Price's own mutual funds, whether they are the best or not in any particular asset class. On the other hand, a CIT target-date fund, because the trustee has a fiduciary responsibility to act on your behalf, is required to look for the best performing funds in each asset class to ensure that the best mutual fund in each asset class is used. The trustee may also negotiate with the underlying mutual fund companies on behalf of the plan participant to get the cheapest share class possible. What are the downside to CITs? Because they are not mutual funds, CITs are not usually listed in online investment databases like Yahoo Finance or Morningstar. They only way to see the performance of the CIT is to go to your 401(k) website. And if you use Yodlee or Mint or some other financial aggregation technology, they usually cannot tell how the CIT is invested because it is not usually listed in Morningstar or Lipper. Because CITs can hire additional companies to help manage the CIT, i.e.: sub-advisers, etc., there are additional costs that can be layered into overall cost of the CIT. Usually these additional costs are less than the discounts provided, so the participants are still getting a lower cost vehicle than a mutual fund, but that may not always be the case. It is important to always compare the cost of a fund before choosing to invest in it, and that is no different in your 401(k) plan.

{"content": "A lawsuit states that a young girl's school refused to let her parents bring her to her classroom. They soon learn that their daughter gets strapped to a specially made chair to restrain her. ( Pixabay )An autistic girl from Indiana is enrolled in a special education program and undergoes an individualized education plan. Her parents are now suing the school district after learning that her teacher had been strapping her onto a chair to restrain her during class.\u2018New And Troubling Behavior\u2019An 8-year-old girl has been in the LaPorte school District\u2019s special education program since preschool because she was diagnosed with autistic spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Some of her symptoms include difficulty adjusting to change, struggling with mutual conversation, and sensitivity to stimuli, but she is also said to be artistic and intelligent.In April of 2017, she came home from school without any shoes, socks, or coat, and then with bruises on her cheekbone and elbow the month after. After the fall semester, her parents state that the 8-year-old began exhibiting \u201cnew and troubling behavior\u201d including extreme meltdowns, nightmares, refusal to wear the seatbelt in the car, and losing interest in art. They also began to notice several bruises on her back, hips, and arms.According to the lawsuit, it was also around this time that the school began preventing the girl\u2019s father from bringing her to her classroom himself. In September, he brought his daughter to the classroom himself and discovered the wooden restraint chair with his daughter\u2019s name on it. It is said to be made of plywood and had partitions attached to some parts of it, and he also noticed a tan belt on the similarly constructed chair beside the one with his daughter\u2019s name.Prohibited Physical RestraintsOn Sept. 29, just days after the discovery, an emergency meeting was held, where the girl\u2019s parents were allegedly told that the chair was made by the teacher\u2019s father, and that the school had done \"nothing wrong.\" According to the parents, her individualized education plan did not include using the restraint chair, and they never received any notification or incident report about having to use the chair on their daughter.Autism spectrum disorder is marked by autistic characteristics such as repetitive behavior, having difficulties with communication, and other symptoms that may make it hard for the individual to properly function at work, in school, or other areas of life. On the other hand, ADHD is marked by inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. People with ADHD may quickly lose focus, talk nonstop, have difficulties in staying put even when they have to, or appear constantly on-the-go.That said, the Indiana Administrative Code prohibits the use of physical restraints in school, including all mechanical restraints or devices that are attached to a student\u2019s body to prevent him or her from moving. The only time such materials may be used is when a student poses an imminent injury risk to self or others.The family is seeking damages for civil rights and constitutional violations against their daughter.", "id": "550"}

Moreover, the company revised its full-year earnings guidance down to $1.30 to $1.50 a share from its previous target of $1.45 to $1.70 a share.

But according to one Wall Street analyst, Ford's stock may have further downside -- a lot of further down.  \"Our downside scenario assumes 2019 EBITDAP (excluding equity income) is ~$7.5 billion or ~32% below our base case, driven by softer market conditions and a more competitive environment,\" says RBC Capital Markets auto analyst Joseph Spak. \"For valuation purposes, we use a ~2.5x EV/ EBITDAP multiple -- this yields a downside scenario of $8.\" Spak rates Ford shares at sector perform with a revised price target of $11.50. Says Spak, \"Ford guided 2018 earnings/FCF down as Europe/China deteriorated. 2020 8% margin target was maintained but certainly seems tougher to achieve now. Restructuring road-map revealed which could consume significant cash leaving little wiggle room if environment deteriorates.\" Hardly a ringing endorsement, perhaps putting the $8 price target in play given challenges in the U.S. passenger car market and rising global trade tensions.

The result of that paired with extremely inconsistent play result in the worst year in a long time, the team finished 4-12.However, all the promise that the team had going to last season has returned for this season, and perhaps it might\u2019ve even grown. The vast majority of the players that were injured last season have already returned to the field. The Houston Texans also added key players through free agency and the draft.The team brought in three offensive linemen as free agents, the chief being Zach Fulton from Kansas City. Two defensive backs were also brought in, Tyrann Mathieu at safety and Aaron Colvin at corner.In spite of not having a first or a second round pick (to fix the QB position), the Texans had a pretty decent draft haul. Three of the team\u2019s first four picks figure to get playing time early an often at the safety, tight end, and wide receiver positions.So, this season definitely has a lot of promise and could really season the Houston Texans take off.

{"content": "If in basketball it's 'live by the three, die by the three,' in Tesla's (TSLA) world it's live by Elon Musk or die by the guy. Tesla fanatics-and investors-breathed a sigh of relief on Thursday as the stock rocketed more than 16%, or $48.70 per share, to $349.54, after Musk promised that Tesla would be profitable each quarter going forward. Not so new, I know, but he also did the unthinkable and actually apologized for something. Musk apologized to the two Wall Street analysts he embarrassed on the first quarter earnings call. He blamed a lack of sleep last time. Tesla's net loss for the three months ending in June came in at $718 million, or $3.06 per share, the company said, wider than the $2.90 per share loss that analysts had predicted, although excluding some one-off items, that figure narrowed to $2.45 per share. The group burned through $740 million in cash over the three month period, but that figure was well below the $900 million expected by analysts. Activist can be relentless, as we found out on Thursday when Roark Capital Group's Focus Brands acquired activist-targeted Jamba (JMBA)  for $200 million. But it wasn't a quick process for the Jamba Juice parent or its insurgent investor Glenn Welling. Students have completed full undergraduate education programs in the time it took Jamba to finally sell. The deal occurred about four years after Welling, who runs Engaged Capital, and another activist fund manager, James Pappas, joined the board of Jamba Juice in a January 2015 settlement. Welling had first accumulated a 7% stake between May and July 2014 and has been accumulating periodically ever since, reporting most recently an 18.25% stake. The sale price of $13 a share in cash represents a slight win for Welling, whose cost basis was about $11 a share, though the profit was many years in the making. The campaign was a difficult slog for Welling who has had more investment success elsewhere, writes The Deal's Ron Orol. Engaged succeeded in pushing Jamba towards a franchising model but the juice chain experienced some headwinds, partly due to its 2016 headquarter relocation from Emeryville, Calif. to Frisco, Texas, which included some layoffs. Markets Today: U.S stocks rebounded to close mostly higher on Thursday as gains by Apple (AAPL)  and Tesla offset concern about the latest round of trade tensions between the U.S. and China.

{"content": "July 29--SANTA CLARA -- \"Oh yeah, it was a big learning experience,\" Foster said. \"I learned from every mistake, everything that was said, all my flaws. I just grew from it.\"That goes for him personally and professionally. He recognizes that the 49ers could have cut ties with him after his Feb. 11 arrest for domestic violence and weapons possession, and he's thankful they stood by him, albeit with the caveat he avoid future trouble.\"It made me appreciate football a lot better,\" Foster said. \"It's crazy knowing football can be gone. But being back on this field with my brothers and coaches, it's a blessing.\"The NFL has suspended Foster the first two games of the season -- Sept. 9 at Minnesota, Sept. 16 vs. Detroit -- as a result of his offseason missteps. He called the discipline \"painful\" but \"accepts the consequences.\"Foster, a first-round draft pick last year, fell into trouble this offseason on Jan. 13, when he got arrested in Tuscaloosa, Alabama for second-degree marijauna possession, a charge that got dismissed May 24 upon his completion of a diversion program.It was the Feb. 11 arrest in Los Gatos for alleged domestic violence that put his career in limbo. But once his ex-girlfriend testified that she falsified her abuse claims in search of money and vengeance, a Santa Clara County Superior Court judge on May 23 dismissed the domestic-violence charges and reduced his assault-weapons possession charge to a misdemeanor.He stayed away from the 49ers during that legal crisis and reported with three weeks to spare in the offseason program. He's stayed out of trouble, as ordered by the 49ers brass.\"That's the message that came through and I respect it,.\" Foster said. \"They stood by me, though. Brotherhood.\"Foster joined the 49ers voluntary offseason program the following day, May 24, and after he pleaded no contest to the weapons violation on June 6, he was put on two years probation and sentenced to 30 days of community service. The NFL suspension came down July 3 for violations of its personal conduct and substance abuse policies.Asked if he did anything wrong, Foster responded: \"I respect your question, but I don't feel like talking about it. Right or wrong or whatever, people criticized me and thought I was wrong. But I'm not going to add fuel to it anymore.\"Foster appreciated the support from the 49ers coaches, his teammates and family. \"It feels good when you have somebody for you. Other than that, it was hard. But small things to a giant.\"With Saturday marking the first day in shoulder pads, perhaps no one looked more eager to test them out than Foster.A one-on-one pass coverage drill promptly saw Foster upend rookie running back Jeff Wilson just as he came off the line of scrimmage. Again and again, Wilson hit the turf in their ensuing matchups, a reminder that Foster is an intimidating force on the 49ers upstart defense.As for Foster's closing speed in coverage, he was able to knock away a pass intended for Jeremy McNichols in the one-on-one session. But once Jerick McKinnon caught a third-and-3 pass on him in the team drills, Foster stomped his feet in disgust over the completion, knowing there's room for improvement. Plus, Foster himself got knocked down on back-to-back plays in 11-on-11 drills.This camp is allowing more opportunities to alter his tackling technique in hopes of preserving his health after an injury-plaqued rookie year that included shoulder stingers, a rib injury and a high-ankle sprain.\"We're trying to get Reuben to use his hands a little bit more, not always fit with his shoulders and stuff,\" Shanahan said. \"He's mindful of it so you can see him starting to use it. Sometimes he does what he's always done, but if you practice that way every day then he has a chance in the season to have improved.\"___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "557"}

{"content": "July 28--Wildfires aren't the only \"new normal\" in California.PG&amp;E is at it again, doing everything possible to shirk responsibility for its role in future disasters. CEO Geisha Williams on Thursday had the audacity to say that Gov. Jerry Brown's new plan to deal with the wildfire liability issue isn't good enough.She's right that the proposal issued by the governor on Wednesday needs work -- but only because it threatens to let PG&amp;E off the hook for the utility's shortcomings at the expense of California ratepayers and property owners. The Legislature should be cautious about rushing to make reforms on an extremely complex issue before its session ends at the end of August, especially because the current liability laws largely are working.As for Williams, she should be more worried about getting her own house in order, starting by taking a hard look in the mirror. PG&amp;E has a well-deserved reputation as the least-trusted utility in California, if not the nation. It is a convicted felon for its negligence in the 2010 San Bruno gas pipeline disaster. CalFire already has blamed PG&amp;E for 12 of the catastrophic Wine Country fires in October and has raised the possibility of criminal prosecution in connection with the blazes. PG&amp;E's demands deserve the same sort of respect the Legislature would give a convicted burglar arguing theft laws are too harsh.Let's not forget that Williams was made PG&amp;E's CEO because of her expertise in electricity operations and to help the utility put the deadly San Bruno disaster behind it. Or that in the same year as the Wine Country fires, her pay package was doubled from just over $4 million in 2016 to $8.5 million. Six of nine other top executives also received total compensation increases in 2017.That same year PG&amp;E failed to take the basic step of purchasing enough insurance coverage to cover the utility's potential liability for the 2017 Wine Country wildfires.The governor and legislative leaders have convened a special committee to examine financial responsibility for future fires. At a minimum, the Legislature should have an independent auditor examine PG&amp;E's books to determine the validity of Williams' claim that maintaining the status quo threatens to throw PG&amp;E into bankruptcy.The committee should be especially cautious about PG&amp;E's desire to replace the state's legal standard governing liability, known as \"inverse condemnation.\" Under current law, if the utility is negligent in maintaining power lines and poles, shareholders must foot the bill. And, under inverse condemnation, the utility is still liable for damages caused by its equipment when it is not negligent, but it can pass those costs on to ratepayers.The theory is that utilities hold that responsibility because they can place their equipment anywhere it deems appropriate, even if it means invoking eminent domain to gain land from property owners.Any changes to the law must ensure that California property owners are adequately protected. The fear is that if the inverse condemnation standard goes away, insurers will hike property owners' rates or decline to offer fire insurance in high-risk areas altogether.PG&amp;E has a long history of playing power politics in an effort to pad its bottom line. The Legislature should not make any alterations to wildfire liability laws until it has taken the time to do a full investigation of the impact on California property owners.___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "560"}
{"content": "July 31--SAN DIEGO -- Sabean and Evans said the Giants pursued deals for young, controllable pitchers, but weren't willing to gut their farm system or overpay to complete a transaction.While the duo from the Giants' front office balked at high prices on the trade market, a young, controllable pitcher who barely cost the club a dime led San Francisco to a 3-2, 10-inning victory over the Padres.Rookie Dereck Rodr\u00edguez, the son of Hall of Fame catcher Ivan Rodr\u00edguez, signed as a minor league free agent with the Giants this offseason after spending six seasons in the Minnesota Twins organization and has burst onto the scene as a legitimate Rookie of the Year candidate.\"That would be one thing my dad never got, so that would be nice,\" Rodr\u00edguez said of the award. \"He got everything else at some point.\"For the second straight day, though, the Giants needed extra innings to down the Padres as Brandon Crawford brought in Evan Longoria with a two-out single in the top of the 10th to give San Francisco the lead. After Longoria led off the inning with a triple, the Giants avoided a catastrophic failure at the plate thanks to Crawford's first pitch laser into right field off of Padres reliever Phil Maton.\"We've been looking for that big hit in a lot of these games,\" Longoria said. \"We've played a lot of close games in the last week.\"While Rodr\u00edguez was brilliant, the Giants' offense didn't provide much run support Tuesday, as the club failed to convert with the bases loaded and no one out in a disastrous eighth inning. After Crawford struck out, Joe Panik hit into a fielder's choice and Gorkys Hern\u00e1ndez flew out to end the threat.Armed with a 2-1 lead, manager Bruce Bochy turned to rookie reliever Reyes Moronta in the bottom of the inning, but Moronta walked the leadoff man and allowed a game-tying fielder's choice. Despite throwing 30 pitches over two innings in Monday's game, Moronta entered with the game on the line as the Giants were short on options in their bullpen.A day after the Giants taxed their pitching staff in a 12-inning win over the Padres, Rodr\u00edguez set a new career-high with 112 pitches in another dominant performance. The converted outfielder hasn't allowed more than two earned runs in a start since June 19 and lowered his ERA to 2.59, which is the best mark among any National League rookie with at least 60 innings pitched.Rodr\u00edguez picked up seven strikeouts and allowed just three hits against San Diego and left the game in line for the win, but the Giants couldn't reward him for his efforts.\"Seven solid innings,\" Bochy said. \"He gave up a run in the first inning and then he just pitched outstanding. We got him pretty far up there in the pitch count, he hasn't been up there, but he's done such a great job and gave us what we needed.\"The Giants scored their first run on a sacrifice fly from the hero of Monday's game, Hern\u00e1ndez, who powered the team to a victory with a 12th inning home run into the second deck of the left field bleachers.On Tuesday, it was the Giants' right fielder who hit a tie-breaking home run, as Andrew McCutchen launched a solo shot to right field in the top of the fifth. The Giants' failure to add on was once again an issue, though, leading to another tense late-inning situation.With six straight quality starts, Rodr\u00edguez has compiled a 1.49 ERA since June 24, which ranks as the third-best mark in baseball behind Chris Sale of the Red Sox and Zack Greinke of the D'backs.\"That's a good group of guys, I guess,\" Rodr\u00edguez said. \"I don't think about that stuff. I just go out there and try to put on a good performance for my team and try to give our guys a chance to win and try to get back into this race.\"The only run Rodr\u00edguez allowed came in the bottom of the first after Wil Myers extended the inning with a two-out infield single. Padres first baseman Eric Hosmer followed with an RBI double, bringing Myers home and pushing San Diego ahead 1-0.The right-hander recovered nicely, allowing just one hit over his next four innings of work as a third inning double down the left field line by Travis Jankowski was all the Padres mustered.___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "561"}
{"content": "People require conversation in every form of relationships including friendship, romance and professional among others. However, meeting new people can be awkward. What do you talk about when you don\u2019t know anything about the other person? In fact, most people cannot define what makes them socially awkward. If you have experienced social awkwardness before, you may wonder if it will go away on its own.Signs to know if you are socially awkward1. If you find people moving away from you in a social situation, there are high chances you are socially awkward. Most people tend to avoid people with poor social skills because it is difficult to hold a conversation with them.     2. If you feel nervous or uncomfortable around other people or you avoid having conversations with other people, you might be socially out of place. You avoid people because you dread any form of engagement.3. When it is hard to find friends. If you are socially embarrassed, it is difficult for you to make friends and when you do they don\u2019t last long. You prefer to spend your time at home alone rather than going out with friends.     4. People that are awkward socially are affected by how others treat them. Their self-esteem is affected by how other people feel about them through what they say or do.On the positive note, you can correct the feeling of discomfort whenever you are in a social situation. Below are some tips that you can use to avoid awkward silences. You can use these tips whenever you are poised for a new conversation with a stranger or a friend you have not met for a long time.Here are tips to help you eliminate awkwardness when talking to people:1. Know how to hold a conversation The first step of dealing with this social setback is by knowing what to say in a way that will not seem weird or awkward. If you totally don\u2019t know what to say, a technique known as conversation threading will help you know what to always say next to eliminate the awkward silence. When you thoroughly practice this technique, your ability to hold conversations will significantly improve.     2. Avoid silent gaps between conversations When you are in a social setting, avoid those long gaps between conversations. In fact, research has shown that it only takes only a few seconds before an awkward silence develops. In addition, the silence is likely to increase your anxiety which will make the situation even worse. To avoid such scenarios, be prepared on what to say in advance. This will help you hold the conversation in a way that will eliminate the silence gaps.3. Give positive compliments Compliments work as magic in eliminating social awkwardness. First, when you flatter a stranger in a positive way, you set the course and tone for the conversation to develop. Secondly, a compliment injects a degree of warmth and positivity in the conversation. However, you should be careful with the compliments you give. Be sure the flatter is honest and specific because general comments may not provide specific direction for a conversation. On the other hand, it is prudent to avoid insincere compliments because they might be easily detected and set a negative tone for the conversation.4. Be attentive Sometimes the awkward silence develops because of lack of attention. There is nothing you can if your partner is not listening or attentive. However, try as much as you can to be attentive and listen actively to what they are saying. This will help know what to say when you are required to speak. In addition, maintain an eye contact and show concern like nodding. Whenever a gap develops between conversations, pick up on what your conversation partner was speaking about.You have to adjust your mindset that not everyone is socially smooth. Social awkwardness in most people is due to anxiety, fear, insecurity and low self-esteem. These sources of awkwardness can be handled when you know how to build your confidence. Identifying the root cause of the awkwardness will help hold and maintain conversations even with strangers.6. Adjust your social skills Have you ever told a joke in a group and nobody found it funny? Do people ignore your comments because they seem out of the conversation? Then, you need to work on your social skills. The best way to do this is to try and hold conversations more often. People who are least awkward spend most of their time speaking to other people.A good way to improve your social skills is to surround yourself with people that are more outgoing. For instance, you can accompany them to social events where they may introduce you to new people. This will help you to eliminate the fear of start conversations with strangers. In addition, a friend who is more social will fill the gaps between conversations and eliminate the awkwardness.", "id": "562"}
{"content": "Aug. 01--I left Chicago in 2001, but I understand the place. I get it. I still read the Tribune every day because it's the news that makes sense to me.Don't get me wrong, I'm not a Chicago whisperer. I'm not Mike Royko or Studs Terkel, but it's home, and I get it in a way I'll never get anything else.When a white supremacist terrorist walked into a Bible study at Charleston's Emanuel AME Church on June 17, 2015, and murdered nine people, I realized that despite having lived in Charleston for several years by that point, I didn't know the place.I wasn't surprised by the racism motivating the murderer, but I thought the initial reckoning that led to the removal of the Confederate battle flag from the South Carolina state Capitol would ultimately also confront the fact that a statue of John C. Calhoun loomed over the city's largest public square, just a few hundred yards away from Emanuel AME Church.If Calhoun was prominent in my Northern social studies curriculum, I'd forgotten his importance by the time I first moved to Charleston. In addition to being vice president of the United States and a senator from South Carolina, Calhoun argued that slavery was not a necessary evil, but a \"positive good\" benefiting slaves.It is an ideology central to the terrorist who killed the nine parishioners engaged in Bible study at Emanuel AME Church. We cannot excuse Calhoun's beliefs through being a \"man of his time.\" The importation of slaves had been banned in 1808, almost 30 years before Calhoun's \"positive good\" theory. The prevailing belief, even among the white population, was that slavery was sinful and that it would one day die a \"natural\" death.That a statue of Calhoun continues to stand in a place of honor confuses and angers me. Why can't others see what seems so obvious -- that his is a past undeserving of honor?Thankfully, I found answers in a book published earlier this year: \"Denmark Vesey's Garden: Slavery and Memory in the Cradle of the Confederacy\" by historians Ethan J. Kytle and Blain Roberts, who are both professors at California State University, but started the book when on the faculty at the Citadel in Charleston.Early on in the introduction, they offer an anecdote of when they looked at an apartment in one of Charleston's old buildings, built in the 1840s by the Toomer family. The prospective landlady said that it was once the space of \"the servants.\"\"Of the slaves,\" one replied.\"There's no evidence in the historical records that the Toomers didn't pay them,\" the woman replied.Confusing double negatives have been in the news lately, but the import of this one was as apparent to me as a reader as it was to the researchers in the moment it occurred.\"Denmark Vesey's Garden\" explores the willful blindness toward \"America's original sin\" among some white Charlestonians. Each chapter fills in the gaps between these two histories -- what happened in the historical record versus what those with a vested interest in another narrative prefer to \"remember.\"Reading the book helped me realize why Calhoun continues to reign over the city, why there is a pitched battle over a new historical marker acknowledging his role in perpetuating slavery and why a city resolution to apologize for slavery passed only narrowly.I'm still angry and believe the Calhoun statue should be removed and his views on slavery roundly condemned. Only now, I can make this statement with a more nuanced view of the issues, because this book achieved what books do best: It bridged a gap in my understanding in ways no other medium could.John Warner is the author of \"Tough Day for the Army.\"Book recommendations from the BiblioracleJohn Warner tells you what to read next based on the last five books you've read.1. \"Dangerous Liaisons\" by Pierre Choderlos de Laclos2. \"Heat\" by Bill Buford3. \"The Handmaid's Tale\" by Margaret Atwood4. \"A Gentleman in Moscow\" by Amor Towles5. \"Amsterdam: A History of the World's Most Liberal City\" by Russell Shorto-- Joe I., Lakewood, OhioThere's a good bit of variety here, so I'm going to hope I just can't go wrong and try \"Corelli's Mandolin\" by Louis de Bernieres.1. \"Alternate Side\" by Anna Quindlen2. \"Lincoln in the Bardo\" by George Saunders3. \"About Grace\" by Anthony Doerr4. \"The Bartender's Tale\" by Ivan Doig5. \"A Good American\" by Alex George-- Susan H., Glen Ellyn\"There There\" by Tommy Orange took the top of my head off, messed around with the insides and put the top back on.

{"content": "July 28--When the Tech Museum of Innovation opened its Hackworth IMAX Dome Theater in 1998, it was the first of its kind on the West Coast. Now, the four-story theater with a wraparound screen is getting ready to blaze a new trail.The 280-seat, downtown San Jose theater has been closed since the beginning of July to undergo a $2.7 million, four-month renovation that will replace its giant 70mm-film projector with a state-of-the art 4K laser projection system. The Tech will have the first IMAX dome in the world to use the new technology.\"It's going to be different, but it's also going to be better,\" said Michelle Duncan, the Tech's director of IMAX theater operations. The theater is scheduled to be used during the Tech for Global Good program in November before re-opening to the general public with \"Oceans: Our Blue Planet,\" a new documentary narrated by \"Titanic\" star Kate Winslet.The new projection will provide a sharper picture and deeper colors than the old system, and that meant replacing the theater's screen -- made up of 469 individual coated aluminum panels -- with a new one. This time the panels will be installed in a way that the seams and rivets holding them together don't show.Duncan says she knows some people will miss those seams in the same way they feel affection for a dent in the family car or a popping noise on a favorite LP. \"I'm sure people will feel that for a moment, but we hope they're just blown away by the image after that like in the old Memorex commercial,\" she said. \"It'll pull you into the environment that much faster.\"The improvements have actually been on the drawing board at the Tech for years, but they had to wait for the technology to catch up, especially with the challenges a dome theater presents compared to a flat screen. IMAX had to re-engineer its regular dual-laser projection system to a single laser and developed a high-resolution \"fish eye\" lens and image-processing software for the dome's geometry.\"It really is awesome because we've updated everything,\" said Brian Bonnick, chief technology officer and executive vice president for IMAX. \"We've created a radically different projector that doesn't have the limitations of other systems. It produces brighter and sharper images with substantially higher contrasts. The images are much more in line with what the human eye was designed to see.\"To create that sharper image on the screen, a lot of chaos and change has to happen behind the scenes. Films used to be brought in on massive reels that were placed on platters before being threaded through the 2,000-pound projector, which had to be lifted up by an elevator to the oblong projection booth -- called \"the doghouse\" -- that jutted between seats in the theater. The film soundtrack was handled separately, synced up with the image and carefully monitored by a technician using a special console.That's going to be all gone. The reel platters have been removed, and the digital projector -- which weighs 3,000 pounds -- won't need to be lowered except for maintenance, and the soundtrack comes as part of the digital package and will be pumped into the new, six-channel sound system.Duncan said the new format will open up a new range of possibilities for programming since more and more IMAX movies are being released digitally and not on film. Ironically, though, it also means the Tech will lose some perennially popular movies, including \"Everest,\" the breathtaking MacGillivray Freeman documentary that both opened the theater in 1998 and was the last movie shown in June.\" 'Everest' has never been rendered digitally, so we won't have access to that,\" Duncan said. \"And others, like 'Lewis &amp; Clark' and 'Forces of Nature' are not available in a high-enough digital capacity to run and look good.\"Unlike the Metreon in San Francisco, which has the capability to run IMAX programming both digitally and on 70mm film, there was just no room at the Tech for two projectors. That means special 70mm film presentations like \"Dunkirk\" or the upcoming re-release of \"The Dark Knight\" would have to pass San Jose by.As a fan of film and the projection system she's worked with for so long, Duncan says it was very emotional letting go. She took pictures as the last two film prints were shipped off, and she began to tear up as she introduced the very last film that would be run on the old projector. \"It's like your child is leaving home,\" she said. \"It's the end of one era, and the beginning of a new one.\"But if there's a silver-screen lining to the dark cloud, it's that the Tech Museum's IMAX projector will not be going to the trash heap. Just as the Tech was getting ready to say goodbye to film last month, huge storms battered Des Moines, Iowa, causing the roof to leak in the Iowa Science Center's IMAX theater. Its projection equipment and all its movies were ruined, and the theater is closed for repair.\"All of our parts are packed up in our lobby with address labels ready to get that theater back up and running,\" Duncan said. \"I'm happy that Projector 156 can breathe life back into that theater.\"___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "564"}

{"content": "30 million years ago, an oceanic crust went under the North American continent and broke into pieces. The pieces melted into the mantle, causing hot material to rise to the crust to create the Yellowstone Super-Volcano. ( Yellowstone National Park )An ancient piece of oceanic crust that lodged itself beneath the North American continent created the Yellowstone Caldera and other volcanoes in the hotspot track, new research shows.Experts at the Virginia Tech College of Sciences say that the Yellowstone super-volcano was created by an enormous plate that moved when the continents started to split some 175 millions years ago.The plate wedged itself under North America, broke off into tiny pieces, and set hot materials up to the surface of the Earth. This led to the creation of the super-volcano and the Yellowstone hotspots track that runs along Oregon, Idaho, and Wyoming.Yellowstone Super-Volcano The Yellowstone super-volcano is a vast expanse of a volcano that covers practically the entire Yellowstone National Park. A super-volcano is a volcano that has erupted at magnitude 8, the highest on the Volcanic Explosivity Index.The dormant Yellowstone has erupted only three times in the last 2.1 million years, the last one taking place 640,000 years ago at Lava Creek. This led to the creation of the Yellowstone Caldera, a giant crater over 1,500 square miles in area that formed when the volcano collapsed in the catastrophic eruption.If the super-volcano erupts again, it will send nuclear winds throughout the world, emit a cloud of ash that will darken the sky for days, and devastate two-thirds of the United States.Oceanic Crust Subduction The new paper published in the journal Natural Geoscience runs counter to the prevailing theory of how the Yellowstone super-volcano came into being.For years, experts have believed that the super-volcano was created by a plume of magma rising from the Earth's core and passing through rifts in the crust to create the super-volcano.However, lead researcher Ying Zhou, theoretical seismologist at Virginia Tech's Department of Geosciences, says scientists have not yet found evidence of a plume of hot materials underneath Yellowstone.Instead, the subterranean images taken by Zhou and her team show evidence of an enormous oceanic plate that subducted the Western United States 30 million years ago.Called the Farallon Plate, it broke into pieces and melted in the mantle. This sent magma to the crust that has been causing volcanic eruptions for the past 16 million years.Underground Images Show Anomalous Structure Working at the National Science Foundation's underground USArray observatory, the team was able to create images of underground structures with the help of seismic waves generated by the movement of tectonic plates. This is called diffraction tomography.Using this new technique, the researchers spotted an anomalous subterranean structure found 250 to 400 miles that follows the trail of the hotspots track.This suggests that the Farallon Plate sank deep into the mantle and pushed magma upward to form Yellowstone. The hotspots track has been moving northwest ever since, says Zhou.\"The process started at the Oregon-Idaho border about 16 million years ago and propagated northwestward, forming a line of volcanoes that are progressively younger as they stretched northwest to present-day Wyoming,\" she says.", "id": "567"}

{"content": "Aug. 03--The iconic Chicago Tribune sign will remain on the exterior of Tribune Tower, even after the newspaper's recent move from the Michigan Avenue landmark.The newspaper's parent company, Tronc, and the real estate firms redeveloping the tower, CIM Group and Golub &amp; Co., reached a settlement Friday to end a lawsuit filed this past spring over the sign's fate.The sign will be removed late this year during work on the tower at 435 N. Michigan Ave., and then be reattached in early 2020 near the end of the project to convert the building to condominiums, Golub Executive Vice President Lee Golub said.The metal sign, which spells out \"Chicago Tribune\" in approximately 8-foot-tall white letters, is on a low-rise portion of the building, facing south along a large plaza. Visible from the Chicago River, it is one of the most recognizable signs in Chicago.\"We came to an agreement, and the sign is going to stay and be part of the development plan as we presented in our public meeting,\" in April, Golub said.Cook County Circuit Court Judge Peter Flynn on Friday entered an order dismissing the lawsuit. Golub and Tronc spokeswoman Marisa Kollias confirmed the suit was dismissed but declined to disclose specific terms of the settlement.The facade that the letters are currently affixed to will be removed. The refurbished sign will be reattached a couple feet higher, held up by posts along the south side of a new seventh-floor area for residents that will include an indoor pool and outdoor deck, Golub said.\"It will act as a sign on the front and as shade for people on the deck on the back side,\" Golub said.The lawsuit was resolved less than two months after the Chicago Tribune and Tronc moved their offices to One Prudential Plaza. The June relocation ended a 93-year run in Tribune Tower, the neo-Gothic tower that was completed in 1925 near the north bank of the river.The developers have owned Tribune Tower since buying it from broadcast company Tribune Media for $240 million in 2016. The separately run newspaper company, Tronc, remained a tenant until its lease expired in June.In April, as the newspaper prepared to move out, Los Angeles-based CIM and Chicago's Golub filed the suit in Cook County Circuit Court over rights to the sign. The developers said the newspaper had informed them that they planned to remove the sign and did not intend to sell it to the developers.The building owners alleged they had the right to buy the sign or any \"roof installation\" for $1 and keep it on the building because of a provision in a lease the newspaper's parent company signed five years ago. CIM and Golub assumed the lease when they bought the property from Tribune Media, they argued.In April, the developers held the first public meeting to present plans for the $1 billion-plus Tribune Tower redevelopment. They unveiled a spectacular vision to convert the landmark tower into 163 residential condos and construct the second-largest skyscraper in the city on a parking lot just east of the existing building.Work to redevelop Tribune Tower is already underway, and major demolition work is set to begin this month, Golub said. The last tenant, bar and restaurant Howells &amp; Hood, will close by Sept. 30, Golub said.Construction on the new 1,422-foot-high skyscraper, if approved, could begin in late 2019. It would have a 200-room hotel, 439 rental apartments and 125 condos.Golub and CIM have continued meeting with community groups and Ald. Brendan Reilly, 42nd, and plan to submit their planned development to the Chicago Plan Commission in September, Golub said.rori@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "569"}

{"content": "Success is something everybody wants. There\u2019s no clear-cut definition of what thus \u2018success\u2019 entails. Some might argue that it\u2019s about wealth and career attainment, while others may passionately counter that it\u2019s about settling with a family you love or developing a more open-minded worldview.Just as there\u2019s no clear-cut definition of success, there is also not a clear-cut path. No matter your definition however, those who we often look up to and consider to be successful and inspiring all share a pocket of similar traits. Work on mastering the list below, and you\u2019ll be well on your way down the path of success, however you may choose to travel it!     Here are 21 inspiring traits to learn from highly successful people:1. Don\u2019t Be Afraid to Dream BigIf your dreams don\u2019t scare you, they\u2019re not big enough! Highly succesful people know that it\u2019s good to take a chance on yourself. Aim high, and shoot for the moon; if you fail, you\u2019ll still land among the stars and learn something about yourself along the way!2. Learn From Your MistakesWhenever you stumble, there\u2019s always an opportunity to get back up. Don\u2019t let your mistakes discourage you. Let them motivate you to try again, but in a different way!     3. Take the Path Less TraveledThe path to success is never clear-cut. Take the path less traveled and forge your own way.4. Get DecisivePeople who are highly successful don\u2019t talk themselves into doubt and discouragement. They consider all of their options, but make the final call with deftness.5. Curiosity Won\u2019t Kill the CatWhile the old adage may warn that \u201ccuriosity kills the cat\u201d, a little curiosity is perfectly healthy and moreover, encouraged! Don\u2019t be afraid of delving into new experiences and subjects. Ask questions, and be open to making mistakes. People who use curiosity to their advantage know that mistakes are just a stepping stone of learning.     6. Trust Your GutIt\u2019s true that oftentimes, your gut feeling is the right feeling. When you find yourself second guessing a decision or becoming skeptical of something, tune in to your intuition, not out.7. Communication is KeyCommunication is the backbone of every prosperous relationship, be it personal or in the workplace. Communicate honestly, openly, and frequently, and always provide or ask for clarification to avoid misunderstandings.8. Find a SolutionFind a solution, not an excuse or someone to blame. Excuses and blame, while somewhat helpful in cushioning the blow of the problem, only extend the problem further.9. Be ResourcefulThose you find inspiring may be big dreamers, but they\u2019re also realistic in what they can do with what they have available to them. Be aware and innovative of your resources and don\u2019t let any opportunity go to waste.10. Take Time to RechargeNo matter how extroverted the individual, everyone needs time alone to recharge. Whether this is a time to relax on the couch and watch a movie or partake in a favorite hobby, time alone helps us to stay rested and stay in-tune with our mental health.11. It\u2019s All About the PassionSometimes, passion can make all the difference. Believe in yourself and others will too! No inspiring life is lead without an eager, driven passion.12. Take a RiskJust as highly successful people are decisive, this decisiveness sometimes means having to take a calculated risk. Outside of one\u2019s comfort zone is just where the reward may reside!13. Change is a Good ThingAs cliche as it may sound, it really is important to roll with the punches and go with the flow. Change is a good thing, and successful individuals know that no inspiring life is lead without a lot of change, and subsequently, a lot of flexibility and adaptability.14. Appreciate How to NegotiateThe idea of \u201cbuy low, sell high\u201d works for selling others on your project too! Don\u2019t sell yourself short, but learn how to negotiate to get what you want. Even if you\u2019re a little afraid of hearing \u201cno\u201d, remember that there is never harm in asking.15. Grow Your NetworkIt\u2019s not about what you know, it\u2019s about who you know. Attend events in your community that will allow you to connect with other professionals and mavericks in your industry. Moreover, work on creating authentic connections, not merely shallow ones.16. Honesty is the Best PolicyTransparency not only with others, but yourself is important. Be realistic about expectations, as well as mistakes or miscalculations so that they can more easily be resolved.17. Get InspiredIt can be hard to stay motivated when you aren\u2019t feeling inspired. Get inspired by listening to music, taking a walk, attending a convention, meeting up with fellow creatives\u2013 whatever will get those innovative gears turning again!18. Inspire OthersOne of the most rewarding aspects of working towards defining your own success is the potential you have to be inspiring towards others. Once you\u2019ve begun to pave a path in the direction you want, be sure to help others do the same!Control your emotions or they will control you.20. Make a CommitmentGetting started is rarely the hard part of a project; rather, it\u2019s the finishing that\u2019s tricky! Once you\u2019ve started something, make a commitment and keep with it.21. Challenge AcceptedOne of the most inspiring tenets of those who are successful is that they treat every experience, (positive, negative, and anywhere in-between) as an opportunity for learning and growth. When a challenge crosses your path, don\u2019t be discouraged; instead, look it square in the eyes and say: challenge accepted.No matter your definition of success, developing and perfecting these traits will help you to achieve that definition. Moreover, developing these traits can help to improve your outlook on navigating everyday life. What\u2019s best of all however, is that these traits can help you to serve as an inspiring figure to others.As you work on mastering these traits, keep in mind that it\u2019s alright to stumble. Stumbling is inevitable and part of the process. Our definition of success? Remembering that it\u2019s more about the journey than the destination.", "id": "571"}

The blaze has already destroyed 536 structures, damaged 117 others, and is threatening nearly 5,000 more.The fire, burning about 100 miles south of California's border with Oregon, has killed five people, including two children and a great-grandmother, as well as two firefighters.Dozens of roadways and highways remained closed, and about 38,000 people have been ordered to evacuate so far. As of Saturday evening, however, some evacuation orders were being lifted, according to the Shasta County Sheriff's Office.The winds, high temperatures and dry vegetation \"still have the potential to fuel fire growth,\" according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. The fire has spread \"in all directions and has made significant runs,\" according to the agency.The fire is one of the largest in California at a time when major wildfires are burning across the state. Fires continued to burn this weekend in Yosemite National Park and Riverside County, and two new fires were sparked on Friday.The Ranch and River fires, which both began in Mendocino County, have combined and crossed into Lake County.

{"content": "The Detroit Pistons\u2019 fifth highest-paid player was an afterthought for much of last season. Langston Galloway is owed $7.3 million in 2018-19. But where does the shooting guard fit on this roster?Do you remember playing \u201cWhere in the World is Carmen Sandiego?\u201d as a kid?Personally, I don\u2019t. But I imagine the concept is similar to Langston Galloway\u2018s current situation with the Detroit Pistons.By the end of last season, he was largely an afterthought.The 26-year-old signed a two-year deal worth just over $14 million back in July 2017. After playing in 27 of the first 29 games, Galloway began to receive plenty of \u201cDid-Not-Plays\u201d (DNPs).In those 27 games, his numbers weren\u2019t terrible. He averaged 6.8 points, 1.8 rebounds, 0.8 assists and 0.5 steals in 14.5 minutes of action. Galloway also shot 40.5 percent from the floor and 38.6 percent from beyond the arc.Again, nothing that will jump out at you. But his play wasn\u2019t awful. Was Galloway trigger-happy? Absolutely. Should he have gone to his dribble more often? There\u2019s no doubt. But his sudden drop off in playing time was odd nonetheless.Of the remaining 53 games, he was benched in 22 of them. This included two five-game stretches where Galloway didn\u2019t see the floor.Part of this could be attributed to Avery Bradley (before he was traded), Reggie Bullock, and Luke Kennard all competing for minutes at shooting guard, in addition to Galloway.Bradley, who struggled during his short tenure in Detroit, started all 40 games when available. That wasn\u2019t going to change as long as he was on the team.Bullock blossomed into one of the league\u2019s best 3-point shooters. He finished second in 3-point percentage, with a final tally of 44.5. Kennard wasn\u2019t as effective, but he did shoot 44.3 percent from the floor and 41.5 percent from deep as a rookie.By the midway point of the season, both players had leapfrogged Galloway in the rotation, and deservedly so. But to bench him so often and abruptly, what purpose could that have served?Only Stan Van Gundy knows the answer to that question.Now Van Gundy is gone, and it\u2019s up to Dwane Casey to figure out how one of the club\u2019s highest-paid players fits into the system.It\u2019s hard to see anyone start at the two over Bullock. His size and 3-point shooting can\u2019t be replicated. That most likely solidifies Kennard as the backup shooting guard.Where that leaves Galloway is anybody\u2019s guess. But it would be a mistake to automatically pencil him in as the third option. Rookies Bruce Brown and Khyri Thomas are knocking on the door, and they\u2019re not as reliant on spot-up jumpers.We\u2019ll have to wait until the preseason to see where Galloway fits with the Pistons.That is, if he even fits at all.", "id": "573"}

{"content": "Facebook and Instagram started rolling out new tools that will show users how much time they have spent on the apps. The tools, which will include ways to limit usage, will look to address the growing problem of smartphone addiction. ( Facebook Newsroom )Facebook officially announced a set of tools that will tell users how much time they have spent on the social network, as well as help them limit their usage.The tools, which will also be available on Facebook-owned Instagram, will try to help curb smartphone addiction. Both teens and adults have been drawn to digital screens, possibly without knowing how many hours per day they spend looking at their phones.How To Check Time Spent On Facebook And InstagramThe new tools have started rolling out on Facebook and Instagram, ready to be accessed by users who will likely be shocked at how much time they spend on the social networks.The tools are found in the Settings page of either app. On Facebook, the option will be Your Time on Facebook, while on Instagram it will be Your Activity.The top part of the tool will be occupied by a dashboard that shows the average time that the user has spent on that app in that device. This is where users will likely be surprised at how much time they spend browsing Facebook and Instagram, instead of doing other, more productive things.How To Limit Facebook And Instagram UseFortunately, the new Facebook and Instagram feature will also help users in limiting the time they spend on the social networks.Below the dashboard displaying the time spent on the apps, users will be able to set daily reminders that will alert them if they have reached a certain amount of time spent on Facebook or Instagram each day. Users are also offered a shortcut to their Notification Settings, with the notifications able to be muted for different lengths of time in case there is a need to focus.Addressing Smartphone AddictionFacebook is the latest tech company to offer tools that look to address smartphone addiction. In June, Apple revealed that the upcoming iOS 12 will come with a new feature named Screen Time, which will provide users with incredibly detailed information on how people use their iPhones and iPads.There has been clamor for tech companies to solve the growing problem of smartphone addiction, and steps such as those taken by Facebook and Apple are just the start of the solution. Smartphone addiction has become detrimental to real-world relationships and may even cause physical conditions such as brain imbalance, so the race to address it needs to go much faster.", "id": "575"}
{"content": "Aug. 03--SAN JOSE -- The maker of digital media players leased 472,000 square feet in the Coleman Highline office and retail complex on Coleman Avenue in San Jose, according to an official company filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Roku leased spaces in four different buildings in the complex, which is owned and is being developed by Hunter Properties. The lease was arranged through Newmark Knight Frank brokers Phil Mahoney, Jeffrey Rodgers and Andy Hueser and CBRE brokers Jeff Houston and Mike Benevento.The company will relocate its headquarters from Los Gatos to north San Jose as a result of the transaction, a company official said. At present Roku occupies 200,000 square feet in Los Gatos.\"Roku is growing and doing well,\" said Mahoney, a Newmark Knight Frank executive vice chairman who assisted Roku in its hunt for new headquarters.Potentially, 2,300 Roku employees could work at the new offices in Coleman Highline, using standard calculations for amount of office space an employee typically needs. The space the company has leased in San Jose is well over twice as much as what it now occupies in Los Gatos.San Jose has been on a winning streak this year in terms of attracting high-profile tech companies to the city from other municipalities in Silicon Valley.8\u00d78, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Bloom Energy and Micron Technology all struck deals in 2018 to relocate major operations to San Jose. Like Roku, 8\u00d78, HPE and Bloom are all shifting their headquarters to San Jose. Idaho-based Micron Technology is moving large operations from Milpitas to San Jose, but is keeping its headquarters in Boise.Tech companies also have intensified their interest in downtown San Jose.Near the Diridon train station, Google is planning a transit-oriented community of office buildings, residences, shops, restaurants, parks, and other amenities such as a cultural loop and eco walk, all part of a project where 15,000 to 20,000 of the search giant's employees could work.Adobe Systems, a few blocks away, is laying plans for an office tower that would represent a dramatic expansion of its existing three-building headquarters campus in downtown San Jose.In the most recent major coup for San Jose, Roku leased the entirety of two office buildings, one at 1167 Coleman and the other at 1173 Coleman, half of a third office building at 1155 Coleman and all of an amenities building at 1161 Coleman, the SEC documents show.Plus, Roku is eyeing three other buldings in the project, depending on availability, the filing disclosed.\"We shall have a right of first offer to expand into (1) any space that becomes available in the remaining portion of Building 2, (2) that certain project building located at 1143 Coleman Ave. and (3) if constructed, that certain project building located at 1179 Coleman Ave.,\" according to the regulatory documents.The transaction also means the office buildings have all been leased by Roku well ahead of their completion. Between the 8\u00d78 and Roku deals, Coleman Highline has quickly become one of the South Bay's most successful office developments.\"Roku looked throughout the Valley before deciding on Coleman Highline,\" Mahoney said. \"This was the right solution for Roku in terms of future growth.\"___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "576"}

{"content": "The Phoenix Suns once again have one of the youngest teams in the league. But now, their core is set, and their future is the brightest in the NBA.The NBA is filled with young talent and now more than ever there is no better time to start building your team from scratch.The concept of superteams are \u2013 and will forever \u2013 be the norm, constructing championship windows three to four years at a time with two or three veteran superstars surrounded by veteran minimums and two-way contracts.However there will always be room for an emerging young team. A team constructed of young fringe stars and veteran leaders that promote the health and vitality of a franchise, all while developing confidence in a slow and methodical manner.This requires a mix of good moves from management, smart drafting, a patient fanbase, team rapport and good \u2018ol fashioned luck.The Suns check the boxes in all of those areas and have now put themselves in a position to keep a young team intact for the foreseeable future. Depending on the trajectory of talent and more W\u2019s in the win column they will consistently have the opportunity to add complimentary talent or a major star.The leader of this movement in Phoenix will be Arizona\u2019s newest mult-millionaire,Devin Booker.This could be the year that he become an All-Star or at least continue to play like one. His ability to flourish in first-year Head Coach Igor Kokosov\u2019s new system will be important, but more so than ever it will require the responsibility of incorporating his new teammates \u2013 most notably number one overall draft pick Deandre Ayton.If successful, it will allow the Suns to continue to build around both of them without having to mortgage much to do so.There has been talk all summer of trading current players like T.J. Warren, Marquese Chriss or Dragan Bender. But what if Kokoskov\u2019s new system utilizes some of the untapped talent that was excavated during his stint in Utah?The inside outside combination of Booker and Ayton will allow all three to highlight their strengths while minimizing their weaknesses. It also gives the organization one more year to evaluate or build Chriss and Bender\u2019s trade value.Alex Len was given the length (five years) in Phoenix and the team gave him every opportunity to contribute. The point being that you don\u2019t want to give up on a pair of newly minted 20-year-olds who, with the addition of a dominant post presence like Ayton, may finally come out of their shells.The current NBA landscape has a few teams with bright futures and young stars. Teams in the East such as Philadelphia and Boston have both destination and prestige going for them while also developing young cores that will be in the perfect position to capitalize on the LeBron-less Eastern Conference that awaits next year.They will vie for championships for the next few years until the rest of the East catches up to them \u2013 that is unless injury or those stars decide to depart for different pastures. There have already been rumblings of Kyrie potentially wanting out of Boston or that there was already discord in Philly among its two budding superstars.The way superstars are demanding trades or signing one-and-done deals will weigh heavily on those organizations in the near future.Young teams in the West are currently playing catchup with the Warriors, along with the rest of the NBA. Their original young core (Stephen Curry, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson) were able to win a championship before they added the second best player in the world \u2013 Kevin Durant \u2013 a method of building a team that Phoenix is attempting to replicate.There are multiple good teams in the West, but the ones with young cores include the Suns, Utah Jazz, and Los Angeles Lakers, to name the top few.The Lakers have talented young pieces and have just added the world\u2019s best player to their franchise, LeBron James. The caveat is they just added a lot of veteran role players, and through trade and necessity, to build around LA-Bron they may end up trading that young talent to acquire more veteran stars to maximize his chances of getting a ring.However, this ultimately will have L.A. rebuilding again in four years once LeBron\u2019s contract is up.The Jazz have been able to do what the Spurs have done in the past, draft great and coach up their talent. The culture that they have built has the same sense of San Antonio, but like the Spurs, Utah\u2019s continued success will be dependent upon retaining their stars, especially their Rookie of the Year candidate Donovan Mitchell, and future draft picks, as it will be difficult to draw free agents due to the locale.This leaves me back to the point that the Phoenix Suns as the team have the brightest young core \u2013 starting with Devin and Deandre.They are both supremely talented and share the court with other young talent such as Josh Jackson who I believe will surprise fans this year along under Coach Igor who wants to teach, but demands accountability.The main reason why this team seems to be on the rise is because the stars Phoenix has want to be here. Devin has said numerous times before the announcement of his contract extension that he had a desire to be here and win championships.He is well versed in Suns history and knows how the arena used to turn up when Charles Barkley was still around. Like Barkley, Devin has taken on the face of the franchise mantra and wants to raise the franchise back to the Barkley-era heights.He caused some to hold their breathe when the media let it be known he questioned management\u2019s decision to release his best friend, and as anyone in Phoenix can tell you once the media sees our stars questioning management it\u2019s open season. Instances like those are prime opportunities for pundits to guess the future destinations of disgruntled stars and help start the process of mentally poaching them to form Superteams elsewhere.However, it came out that he just wanted a heads up, which shows maturation as a leader of a team and franchise. He did not pout but he made his point, a point that management needs to continue to nurture and develop to build those bonds with their stars.Then there is Deandre, the former University of Arizona Wildcat who has literally grown up before our eyes in Arizona, which should give Suns fans great solace and pride that the number one pick wanted to be drafted by the franchise that is at the heart of the Valley.Becoming a great player will come naturally, but he and Devin\u2019s ability to promote Phoenix will be key to management\u2019s future moves. Blake Griffin already suggested Phoenix as a low-key great city so who knows what that means in the heart\u2019s of free agents if the Suns shock the basketball world and make the playoffs this year.Ultimately the game requires multiple stars to win, but there are only a handful of teams with that level of talent, and depending on relationships and locale that can change at any second.Here\u2019s to hoping our superstar Suns will allow the once pillar-of-the-league franchise to shine bright once again, and that their careers eventually set in the West.", "id": "578"}

{"content": "July 26--In a rare act of rebellion, Cook County primary election voters in March fired one of the Democratic Party's most powerful politicians. They nominated a newcomer, Frederick \"Fritz\" Kaegi, a financial adviser from Oak Park, to appear on the November ballot in place of incumbent Assessor Joseph Berrios.Kaegi ran a grass-roots campaign that tapped into local taxpayer resentment over rising property taxes and Berrios' insider politics. The saga of Berrios' office accepting campaign money from attorneys whose clients wanted assessment reductions attracted international interest. The Economist magazine profiled the race last fall in an article with a headline that summed up Berrios' reign: \"How Cook County's Democratic machine works.\"The system of assigning property values in Cook County, a key exercise in determining property tax bills, along with the property tax appeal process have long been viewed as rigged. An award-winning 2017 Tribune and ProPublica Illinois series, \"The Tax Divide,\" exposed the system as clout-driven and regressive, hurting minority and low-income communities while protecting wealthier ones. Yet Berrios relentlessly defended it. His refusal to admit the obvious inequities cost him his job.Hope for newcomer Kaegi is high as he prepares to take over what has been an engine of Democratic fundraising. Every assessor -- but especially Berrios, who also ran the Cook County Democratic Party -- has leveraged the position to rake in huge campaign donations from tax appeals lawyers and property owners. Not anymore. Kaegi says he won't take donations from those interests, which he dubs \"the tax appeals industrial complex,\" and he would support an ordinance banning such contributions.Once Kaegi gets past the general election as expected -- he faces a Republican opponent who isn't campaigning -- he will begin dismantling a system that benefits the state's most powerful interests. House Speaker Michael Madigan, Chicago Ald. Edward Burke and many other elected officials, lawyers, lobbyists and influence peddlers have earned fortunes off the broken property tax system. Madigan's and Burke's law firms represent some of Chicago's most expensive commercial properties, seeking lower assessments.But if taxpayers expect swift change under Kaegi, they might be disappointed. Reversing decades of established bad practice in property valuation will take time. Motivating and training a patronage-laden and union-protected workforce in the assessor's office will take persistence. Confronting the state's elites who profit from a fixed property tax system will take courage.Kaegi's win represented more than taxpayer backlash. It set him up for a clash with the titans. During a meeting with the Tribune Editorial Board, Kaegi said he'll have the tools to fix flaws in the system that punish low-income homeowners, without leaning on Springfield to enact changes. Through models he expects to test, and with a data-rich real estate landscape, there's no reason the assessment process can't be fair and transparent.That's good. But remember, many factors determine what property owners owe in taxes: their school district's spending, their ZIP codes, the existence, or not, of commercial development. All of that is part of the puzzle that determines a tax bill. City dwellers got their new reassessment notices this summer, with some North Side property owners reporting increases. North suburban communities are next. Then the south suburbs.There is no guarantee that a new assessor, running a fairer assessment system, will mean lower property tax bills. But we hope it will mean renewed trust in that system. Kaegi believes property owners, especially those familiar with the appeals process, are willing to pay their fair share, as long as they feel confident the system isn't driven by politics.Property taxes and how they're determined should be a math problem, a formula on paper, not a money grab for politicians. Taxes guide business owners and residents in their decision-making on whether to stay in Chicago and Illinois -- or whether to join the exodus of expatriates moving to other states.It's crucial the assessment process be corruption-free and transparent. Finally, there's hope it will be both.Join the discussion on Twitter @Trib_Ed_Board and on Facebook.Submit a letter to the editor here or email letters@chicagotribune.com.___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "581"}
{"content": "July 28--SAN FRANCISCO -- Matt Cain, Ryan Vogelsong and Brian Wilson were all right-handed pitchers, All-Stars and key members of pitching staffs that led the Giants to world championships, but they took distinctly different paths to their new place on the Giants' Wall of Fame.Cain was a first round draft choice, a player whose first taste of big league action came before his first legal sip of alcohol. A well-respected workhorse who was often the victim of his team's poor offensive outputs, Cain spent all 13 seasons of his career in San Francisco.Calling Vogelsong a journeyman wouldn't do justice to the road he traveled, but his voyage through the baseball universe took him to Japan and back before he became a steadying force in Giants rotations.While Cain was seemingly destined for greatness and Vogelsong a lovable underdog, Wilson earned a reputation as one of the sport's most colorful characters for the anti-establishment, rebellious vibe he gave off.There are few ways to contextualize their place in Giants history together, but there is one common thread among the three pitchers whose plaques on the Wall of Fame will be unveiled Saturday.They all pitched on the same staffs as Madison Bumgarner.Bumgarner's road through the organization was most similar to Cain's, so it should be no surprise the two became fast friends when the left-hander arrived on the scene.\"Right from the start when I got here, he was somebody that you wanted to be around and you gravitated towards,\" Bumgarner said.Since 2005, Cain and Bumgarner are the only two players to throw a pitch for the Giants before their 21st birthday. It's a reminder of how quickly they achieved success in the major leagues, which Vogelsong can't relate to.The well-traveled righty was out of a big league job after 2006, as his 5.86 career ERA to that point wasn't attractive to major league suitors. Five seasons later, after stops in Japan, the Venezuelan winter league and Lehigh Valley with the Phillies' Triple-A affiliate, Vogelsong reemerged with the Giants and represented the club in the 2011 All-Star Game.\"It takes a different breed of guy to be able to do that,\" Bumgarner said. \"Not many people could do that. I'm sure the road he took makes him all the more appreciative of the success that he had and the things he got to experience and be apart of. It's pretty special.\"The Giants won all seven of Vogelsong's postseason starts, feeding off the competitive energy and unmatched intensity he brought to the park each day.\"I think stories like that are more special than a guy that just comes up and he's here and has a good career or whatever,\" Bumgarner said. \"That kind of story I think is way cooler.\"While Cain and Vogelsong possess a number of common traits, it's impossible to compare them to Wilson, whose four-season stint as the Giants closer was often as entertaining as it was nerve-wracking for fans to watch.Wilson collected 171 regular season saves with the Giants, but his finest moment came in the postseason when he struck out Nelson Cruz to clinch the club's first World Series title since the franchise moved west to San Francisco.\"He had a different lifestyle and that was no secret,\" Bumgarner said. \"I don't know if me and him had a whole lot in common, but here at the field he was just as good of a teammate as you could have. A great teammate.\"Wilson's inclusion in the ceremony suggests the Giants have sorted out any differences between the former closer and the franchise. While playing for the Dodgers, Wilson appeared to yell at team president Larry Baer in the stands before a game, but after throwing out the first pitch on Opening Day this season Wilson said the duo was simply having a conversation.Any hard feelings that may have existed certainly didn't carry over into the Giants clubhouse, as Bumgarner praised Wilson for his dedication to his craft.\"He showed up every day and worked really hard,\" Bumgarner said. \"As hard as anybody can work. During the game, he was always in the game and helping guys. The ultimate competitor too. All the stuff you would want from a guy.\"The trio of honorees may have led different lives inside and outside of baseball, but they all contributed to the most successful run in franchise history. Though they aren't in the Giants clubhouse anymore, one player they all pitched with still is.Bumgarner will sit in the audience for Saturday's ceremony, but he knows he'll eventually be reunited with old friends. A plaque is in his future, regardless of what happens from here.___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "582"}

There will be minor detours and drivers can expect delays.  Work is underway for Town Farm Road, which will be milled, partially curbed, paved and marked. There is also drainage work.  In August, the town will start milling Great Brook Road, Blue Bonnet, Sega Drive and Roadside Court, though not necessarily in this order. Milling is also expected to start soon on Youngsfield Road, Railroad Street, Carmen Hill #1 and #2 , Cedar Hill Road and Littlefield Road. A timeline has not been announced for these roads.                              Construction is also expected to start in mid-August on Long Mountain and Squire Hill roads. The bids were recently awarded to M&amp;O construction for about $2.8 million.  Work is continuing on the Still River rotary after the concrete testing passed. Traffic will soon switch to the opposite side of the rotary once that work is complete and following a meeting with the police department.  Dayton, the contractor for the Mill Street bridge project, is working on drainage and backfill of the abutments. It should take about another week.", "id": "583"}
{"content": "One stock that has had just a miserable summer season so far is Tesla (TSLA) . The reasons are multiple. Pressures on the name have been felt due to the regularly erratic behavior of the CEO, to the recent headlines covering rising costs to insure oneself against a default of the firm's debt. That came on the heels of news that the firm had asked several suppliers to refund some cash to assist with profitability. What I do know about this firm is that it has always been a cash-burn story. At times, production levels improve to the point where profitability can reasonably be spoken of. Nomura, just last week, came out to defend the firm. Analyst Romit Shah wrote on that point: \"If Tesla can execute to plan, we believe that the narrative around bankruptcy risk will go away, thereby reducing short interest and driving the stock higher.\" Nomura has TSLA rated as a \"buy\" with a $450 price target.  From my neck of the woods, I only know that CEO Elon Musk is indeed the money man. Musk seems to be able to raise dough whenever dough is needed. As an investor/trader who usually values fundamental analysis as much as, if not more than, technical analysis (I eagerly use both to my advantage), I can honestly tell you that I have lost money most of the times that I have shorted TSLA over the years, and that I have made very nice gains both of the times that I have reluctantly played this name from the long side. The last one was just an experiment, because I could not get the borrow ahead of first-quarter earnings. TSLA Expectations Tesla reports on Wednesday, and the first expectation would, in my opinion, be that the CEO will not lash out at any analysts asking questions that investors want answered as the earnings call commences. Consensus view for second-quarter EPS is $-2.81. The range of expectations made public by 21 analysts spans from a low of $-3.44 to a high of $-1.71. Whispers are in the neighborhood of $-2.90, and Q2 2017 printed at $-1.33.  As for revenue, the average estimate seems to be around $3.97 billion. That would be up from $2.79 billion for Q2 2017, and good enough for year-on-year growth of 42.3%. To be fair to TSLA, the firm has beaten expectations for revenue in seven consecutive quarters, and that number has increased sequentially in each of the the last six. I see these cars every day now. They're around.  To tell you the truth, I just don't know what counts for more on this chart, the obvious Fibonacci support level that came into play last week, or the declining top-and-bottom trend lines that require the observer to completely omit wild market reactions that appear to be caused by keyword-seeking algorithmic overreaction. Fundamentally, the name is a mess. It always has been. Free cash flows remain badly negative, Current and Quick Ratios scream out for help at levels that usually prevent me from even considering investment. Almost one third of the entire float is still held in short positions... and that's just it. No matter how ugly this name is, there is still one aggregate clocked buy ticket out there for something like 37.3 million shares. Hard to ignore. Ideas on How to Play From an equity perspective, I will likely make my mind up in the final 15 seconds of this Wednesday's trading session. We all know that the name can swing, so if I do initiate an equity position, it will be small in size. More for the thrill of having skin in the game than for anything else. Currently a 297.50 August 3rd straddle (options strategy involving a put and call with the same strike and same expiration.) will cost you (based on Friday's close) $26.38, meaning that for a trader invested in that idea, the last sale would have to move either above $323.56 or below $270.80 (by this Friday) just to do more than break even. Is the risk/reward there for such activity. I'm not sure it is. I do not think that my usual options writing strategies that I use to raise revenue apply here at all. I use those strategies as much for the raising of revenue as I do for portfolio building. I do not want TSLA in my portfolio for anything other than speculation. This name could very well run wild in either direction, causing much pain and the gnashing of teeth. I'll probably go out a few months and buy a deeply out of the money put for some lunch money. Seems silly? That's where the risk/reward actually makes sense for a trader on a retail (or common sense) budget. October $120 puts went out at $1.90 on Friday. October $470 calls went out at $1.03.

{"content": "Aug. 03--Football returned to center stage Thursday night with the NFL's Hall of Fame Game starting the exhibition season at Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium. But before the Bears and Ravens kicked off, the teams' approach to the national anthem was under the microscope.The Bears, not surprisingly, stood along their sideline with arms locked, consistent with the team's approach from last season. Ravens players also all stood as Anne Cochran sang \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\"Player demonstrations during the anthem have been a hot-button issue for the past two years, with the NFL and its players' union at odds on whether the league should adopt a policy that could punish players who kneel or adopt another posture during pregame anthem ceremonies.Players who have demonstrated during the anthem have taken the stance that they are pushing to raise awareness of social injustice in the U.S. On the other side, vocal critics of player demonstrations -- most notably President Donald Trump -- have chided players who have demonstrated as disrespectful and unpatriotic.After Tuesday's practice in Bourbonnais, Bears coach Matt Nagy said his team still was discussing how they would handle the anthem for Thursday night and beyond. Nagy said he felt \"really, really good with where we're at.\"\"I know this,\" the Bears coach added, \"whatever we do, we're going to do it together.\"Outside linebacker Sam Acho, who is also the team's NFLPA representative, said the Bears have had discussions on the issue and have found ways to respect and appreciate differing points of view.Acho acknowledged that finding a plan for how to approach the anthem has been challenging when taking into account the viewpoints of so many players, coaches and executives.\"It's really, really hard,\" Acho said. \"And it can be confusing at times on how do you find an answer. How do you get a solution? Because not everyone has the same beliefs. Not everyone has the same experiences. Not everyone has the same skin color. Not everyone has the same religious background. Not everyone has the same sexual orientation. We come from so many different backgrounds and experiences, so it's going to be hard to figure out one solution that fits everyone.\"But the great thing about a team is when you do something for your brothers, you're doing it for yourself. And so even if you don't believe wholeheartedly in some issue, you believe in your teammates. So you do it for your teammates.\"Before kickoff Thursday, the Bears' show of unity was on display.dwiederer@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "585"}
{"content": "Aug. 01--E.L.A.W. is a man on a mission. To have him tell it, he doesn't just make music to construct unique beats or decontextualize unique samples. No, the Nigerian-American producer (named Olawale Afolayan) makes music with the express desire to connect the black diaspora and bring them back to their motherland.\"I just want all of my friends to feel more comfortable with their African background,\" Afolayan says. \"I want that dialogue between African-Americans and Africans about going back home to Africa.\"Music making is a new pursuit for Afolayan. Although he grew up attending church and playing the drums, he never considered making music to be a viable career choice. \"I wish I was doing this when I was 16. It was always there but I never homed in on it,\" he said. As a student at DePaul, he originally intended to become a doctor but switched gears after realizing that path was not the right one for him.Things changed in 2016. It was a powerful year for many in this country but for Afolayan, it was the year in which he realized the mere creation of music itself could form the bridge between his philosophical ideals of returning home and the people he most wanted to hear his message.\"This is it right here. We need to start having dialogue about going back home and building our communities,\" says Afolayan. \"I'm letting my music build a link.\"A self-taught musician, Afolayan began building beats on his iPad, first starting with rudimentary software like GarageBand and transitioning to more advanced programs such as Logic and ProTools. The learning curve took about a year, a small drop in the bucket of any given musician's life.Since those earliest music experiments, Afolayan has amassed a large body of work, largely kept to himself. However, last month, the producer released his debut EP, \"Every Last African Warrior.\" The six-track EP is an eclectic, sample-heavy blending of the Afrobeat and hip-hop genres, creating a sound uniquely Afolayan's own. \"I let the sample take me where to go with my beat. I don't think too much when I'm making it. I just like to be in the groove,\" he adds.Curious listeners can catch the producer at one of his first big shows as part of \"Summer Jams,\" a series of programming curated by MPAACT, an organization that aims to develop, nurture, and produce African-centered theater grounded in the traditions of African culture and its diaspora. \"If you're going to go to my show, you're going to hear a lot of music you might not be familiar with, but it's going to be translated it in a way you'll understand,\" he says. Afolayan wouldn't want it any other way.\"I want Nigerians in Chicago to know there is E.L.A.W. in Chicago and he's making hip-hop and Nigerian music,\" Afolayan says. \"Music has always been a way to connect to people, and if I am able to do that, I can also use my music to paint a perfect picture.\"Britt Julious is a freelance writer.onthetown@chicagotribune.comWhen: 10 p.m. SaturdayWhere: Greenhouse Theatre, 2257 N.

{"content": "April 17--The new home of the Los Angeles Times will be at 2300 E. Imperial Highway in El Segundo.A spokesman for Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, soon to be the newspaper's new owner, said The Times would relocate to that address permanently sometime before the end of June, when the lease at its longtime headquarters in downtown Los Angeles expires.Employees will move into a 120,000-square-foot building already on the site, at the intersection of Imperial Highway and North Douglas Street.The building is currently being reconfigured to house a newsroom spread across multiple floors as well as a cafeteria, a museum gallery, a retail shop, multimedia studios and event spaces, Soon-Shiong said Friday during an interview.The 4.5-acre property also has room for a second building to be built from the ground up as needed, he said.The Times has been at its current location in downtown L.A. since 1935. But it became a lessee two years ago after a previous owner sold the iconic Art Deco building to Canadian developer Onni Group.Soon-Shiong said Onni has demanded a $1-million-a-month rent increase to keep the paper's staff at the building across from City Hall, money that could be better spent on resources for the newsroom. Because he owns the El Segundo building, the paper will have more flexibility and control, he said.In announcing the move to El Segundo to The Times' staff Friday, Soon-Shiong said he envisioned a campus with a modern newsroom that \"is there for the next 100 years.\"In February the billionaire former surgeon struck a $500-million deal with media company Tronc to buy The Times, the San Diego Union-Tribune, Spanish-language publication Hoy and several small Southern California community papers, including the Glendale News-Press and the Daily Pilot in Costa Mesa.The sale is expected to close this month.___(c)2018 the Los Angeles TimesVisit the Los Angeles Times at www.latimes.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "587"}
{"content": "July 29--Firefighters battled a two-alarm fire Sunday morning at a house near downtown San Jose, and officials said 11 people have been displaced by the blaze.The fire broke out a bit before 9 a.m. at a Victorian-style home in the 100 block of Sixth Street near the corner of St. John Street, and smoke filled the air in the neighborhood and was visible for blocks.San Jose Fire Department got a call reporting the fire at 8:53 a.m., and crews were at the home four minutes later, searching for a resident they were told may have still been inside, according to Capt. Mike Van Elgort.However, the person had already fled, and there were no injuries reported as a result of the fire.Fire engines and hoses lined Sixth Street, as neighbors watched from the sidewalk while firefighters battled the fire from inside the home and on its roof.Shaunn Cartwright, who lives in a home on St. John adjacent to the home that caught fire, said she was relieved to see crews kept it from spreading to other homes.\"I woke up to the crackling sounds,\" she said Sunday. \"The fire was right outside my window. I opened my back door and there was just flames on the other side of the fence. Everything was just orange with fire, and my house immediately filled up with smoke.\"Across the street from the fire, Christian Bonner was preparing to cook some eggs for breakfast with his family when he heard fire engine sirens getting louder and closer to his home.\"You heard them turn down the sirens and normally that means they're pretty close,\" Bonner said.Van Elgort said it appears the fire may have started in the rear exterior of the home and spread inside, but the cause of the fire and exact location where it sparked were still under investigation.He said the first firefighters responding put \"life and limb\" at risk to search for anyone inside and aggressively fight the fire, which was shooting flames out of the rear of the home and billowing smoke into the air.Around 10 a.m. Sunday, crews were still at the house checking it for any more flames.Van Elgort said there were 11 people living in a few units in the upstairs and downstairs areas of the home, and they were all displaced.Neighbors immediately next to the home that caught fire were able to return to their homes Sunday, he said.___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "588"}
{"content": "Ever wonder why people break up and get back together? Well, science says there really is no surprise because half the couples breaking up do end up giving their relationship another go. Take a look at some explanations based on science that point out why couples who supposedly have sworn off each other get back together.Here Are 9 Reasons Why People Break up and Get Back Together\u201cTo know when to go away and when to come closer is the key to any lasting relationship.\u201d \u2013 Domenico Cieri     1. They were unsure about why they were breaking up in the first place.Researchers at the Kansas State University discovered in a study published in the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships that at least 50 percent of couples are usually ambivalent about the breakup in the first place. They might have doubted calling it quits. Or they might have made a mistake by breaking up a relationship for shallow reasons.  Thus, getting back together, in this case, would by fairly easy since there was no real harm or trauma in the relationship.2. They didn\u2019t really stop hooking up.Couples who have ended their relationship but still continue to see each other for a hookup aren\u2019t really over each other. Experts from Bowling Green State University and the University of Wisconsin found it\u2019s harder for individuals to separate for good if they are still physically attracted to each other. Apparently, each time ex-partners get together, their bodies release oxytocin hormones. These hormones make them feel attached and interlinked, hence renewing the relationship becomes inevitable.     3. They think the way they communicate with each other has improved.Communication is important in any relationship, as it helps couples relate to each other. Communication is also the tool couples use to compromise with each other when there are issues that bother them. Breakups happen when there\u2019s a breakdown in the communication. But when two people begin talking again without friction and tension after they\u2019ve been apart for a while, they could find it easier to express their feelings. Because they assume that the way they communicate has improved, many couples decide to give each other another chance.4. They hope their partner changed for the betterScientists from the University of Utah and the University of Toronto learned in another study that many couples agree to get back together because they believe their partner changed for the better. They are positive about renewing the relationship with someone they think has improved.5. It\u2019s a shame to throw away all those years of being together.Speaking of investment, long-term couples who have broken up decide to be back in each other\u2019s arms because they don\u2019t want to start a new relationship with a new person. They don\u2019t want to go through dating again when they have invested so much time with their old partner. For them, it would be a shame to throw away all those years, even if some of those years were filled with conflict and tension.     6. They believe that a familiar intimacy is better with a former partner.It is hard for people to start all over in the realm of intimacy after breaking up, especially after being intimate with one partner for a long time. Some people might not be willing to go through the motions again with a new person. They think that it\u2019s a good idea to get back together with a former partner because of that familiar intimacy.7. They are not open to change. Psychologists at the Stanford University stated that there are people who struggle after a breakup because they aren\u2019t open to change. Even if all signs indicate that they were in a relationship with the wrong person, they still want to slide back into the love affair. They may hope to try again because the prospect of change is much more nerve-wracking.Researchers from the Northwestern University learned that people who haven\u2019t properly dealt with the breakup could be easily tempted to get back together with an ex after breaking up. If they\u2019ve been trying to bury the pain instead of acknowledging it, they could find themselves back in the arms of their former lover. Unfortunately, according to experts from the University of Arizona, these people have yet to develop a strong sense of self. They do not yet know who they are and what they want from life as an individual. This can happen even among older and supposedly more mature people because self-discovery is a never-ending process.9. They don\u2019t want to be alone.Sometimes, the thought of being alone pushes people to get back with an ex. However, this choice doesn\u2019t have to do with the way they feel about their partner. Rather, it\u2019s about their feelings of vulnerability, according to life coach Kali Rogers.Final thoughtsSo, you see there are many reasons why people breakup and get back together. Such couples may discover that love can be lovelier the second time around. For this to happen, couples need to stay positive. They must also work harder to make their relationships stronger. Otherwise, the same issues they disagreed about in the past may return and bring down their relationship once more.", "id": "589"}
{"content": "July 28--Federal authorities cracked down Friday on a controversial scrap shredder along the North Branch of the Chicago River, the latest in a series of legal actions prompted by complaints about clouds of metallic pollution drifting into the Bucktown and Lincoln Park neighborhoods.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's regional office in Chicago cited General Iron Industries with multiple violations of the Clean Air Act after inspectors found the scrap yard had failed to contain lung-damaging particulate matter within the company's property. The agency also accused General Iron of violating the law by failing to reduce emissions of noxious chemicals and heavy metals linked to birth defects and cancer, including lead, mercury and zinc.General Iron has been on the EPA's watchlist of chronic polluters since at least the late 1990s. But the agency didn't step in this time until Ald. Brian Hopkins, 2nd, revealed last year that University of Illinois at Chicago researchers had found alarming levels of particulate matter downwind from the facility. The independent monitoring, commissioned by a neighbor fed up with smoke and noise from the facility's two massive shredders, prompted the EPA to order its own set of tests, which General Iron conducted in May under agency supervision.The scrap yard's unsightly piles of flattened cars, twisted rebar and used appliances have increasingly looked out of place as other North Branch industries either moved or went out of business. Bordering the scrap yard on three sides is property acquired by developer Sterling Bay for its Lincoln Yards project -- one of the sites city leaders are pitching for a second Amazon headquarters that could employ up to 50,000.General Iron's pollution problems are of even greater concern for neighbors. While the company announced last week that it plans to move to the Southeast Side by 2020, Hopkins and others want it shut down immediately.\"Every day it continues to operate is a day that General Iron's toxic air pollution is a risk to our community,\" Hopkins said in an interview. \"Despite the big EPA fines, the promises to improve, the modifications they've made, none of it has worked. They need to go now.\"In a statement, General Iron disputed the details of the EPA's enforcement notice and said pollution from its scrap shredders is a mere fraction of industrial emissions in the Chicago area. At the same time, the company vowed to install new pollution-control equipment to \"ensure compliance with, or exceed, environmental requirements.\"EPA inspectors used an infrared camera to track pollution leaving General Iron's property. The agency said its investigation also determined the company emits more pollution than previously thought, crossing a threshold that requires the company to obtain a new permit with more stringent requirements.Violations outlined in the EPA notice suggest that pollution controls required in a 2012 settlement failed to eliminate the company's environmental problems. Another settlement in 2006 required General Iron to finance $750,000 in environmental projects and pay a $250,000 fine for shredding appliances during the previous decade without removing ozone-depleting refrigerants.Hopkins said the UIC researchers are planning to conduct more air quality testing around General Iron later this year.Already squeezed by gentrification, the company lost one of its last bulwarks when the city eliminated industrial zoning protections along the North Branch. Hopkins and two colleagues, Ald. Michelle Smith, 43rd, and Ald. Scott Waguespack, 32nd, are pushing to turn the site into a riverfront park.mhawthorne@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "590"}

This project is planned for a block from the hotel site.Also a block away, a 27-story residential tower is being planned, a development that could be the tallest building in San Jose.\"There is a lot of development going on and being planned, you can really see this is a neighborhood that's changing,\" Heilbronner said.Already under construction is the Sparq apartments, a 105-unit residential complex, with ground floor retail, just down the street at South First and East Reed streets. Adding to the neighborhood's rising activity is The Pierce, a new 230-unit residential development where tenants are now living.Plans for the new hotel at 605 S Second St. have emerged at a time when the lodging market has become robust in Silicon Valley and other parts of the Bay Area.\"There is an explosion of hospitality growth throughout the Bay Area,\" Heilbronner said.During the first four months of 2018 compared to the similar period of 2017, average revenue per available room rose 5.4 percent in Northern California and by 7.7 percent in the Santa Clara County and Peninsula areas, excluding the San Francisco airport area, according to a July 3 report released by CBRE Hotels.Adding to the optimism are plans such as Google's proposed transit-oriented community of offices, residences, shops, restaurants and open spaces near the Diridon train station, a development where 15,000 to 20,000 of the search giant's employees would eventually work.San Jose-based Adobe Systems intends to build a new office tower next to its existing three-building downtown headquarters campus, marking a big expansion fueled by major employee growth.\"The volume of downtown San Jose is filling up as it becomes more urbanized,\" Heilbronner said.___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "591"}

People choose other restaurants to dine because they do not want the hassle of the parking and the constant traffic from San Carlos to Willow Street. The attraction of Lincoln Avenue is diminishing.Janet WrightSan JoseA: One final semi-salvo.Q: I find the Willow Glen parking behind the businesses on the west side of Lincoln Avenue to be quite convenient, so that is always my destination. Then I walk everywhere after that. But I will go far out of my way to avoid driving down Lincoln. It has few traffic lights, so people turning onto the street are obstacles, and pedestrians can activate the crossing lights whenever they wish, halting traffic.Bonnie HomeSan JoseA: Momentum is turning.Q: Lincoln Avenue has become busier than ever in the last two years with great restaurants like Black Sheep Brassiere and The Table thriving. Even the yogurt shop that closed (blaming the road diet) was replaced with a Thai rolled ice cream shop that has lines out the door. Lincoln is more walkable, safe and pleasant. I love it.John CherniavskySan JoseA: John lives a block off Lincoln.Q: Sidewalks are always full and more bustling, businesses are crowded and there's always a crazy wait for tables at restaurants on Lincoln, so it doesn't seem like parking has bottlenecked economic vitality in Willow GlenChris JohnsonSan JoseA: And today's final word.Q: I cycle through Willow Glen and have been doing so for years. Any commute-time backup on Lincoln is no different in length from what it was before the road diet and if people stopped being so angry, they might discover that Willow Glen is much nicer now that it's not choked with four lanes of loud and speeding vehicles.Eamonn GormleyCampbellA: A study last year found that the number of people exceeding the speed limit by over 5 mph has fallen 44 percent, and the number of speeders over 10 mph has dropped by 60 percent.Join Gary Richards for an hourlong chat noon Wednesday at www.mercurynews.com/live-chats.

{"content": "Former Tar Heel inks deal with Arizona CardinalsFormer University of North Carolina standout Tre Boston has agreed to a free agent contract with the Arizona Cardinals, according to a report from NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport. Boston and the Cardinals came to terms on a one-year deal worth $1.5 million with a potential to reach $3 million if incentives are met.Boston, who spent the first four seasons of his career with the Carolina Panthers and Los Angeles Chargers, visited the Cardinals a few months back, but couldn\u2019t come to an agreement with the team at that time. Arizona must have sweetened the pot this time around, nabbing the 26-year-old defensive back in what has been a very cold free agent market for safeties this offseason.Boston played in all 16 games for the Chargers last season, starting 15 of them and aptly contributing to the team\u2019s terrific secondary. He accumulated 56 tackles in 2017, including 23 assisted tackles. He also hauled in five interceptions and eight passes defended.It was easily the best of Boston\u2019s four professional seasons, and one that the Cardinals organization took note of, particularly after the release of All-Pro defensive back Tyrann Mathieu. They also decided against re-signing Tyvon Branch, leaving a sizable hole in the Arizona defensive backfield.Boston and the Cardinals will look to build on the team\u2019s 8-8 record from a season ago, and compete with last year\u2019s first-place team \u2014 also the prohibitive favorite to win the NFC West in 2018 \u2014 the Los Angeles Rams.Stick with Keeping It Heel for all the latest on North Carolina alumni in the NFL.", "id": "596"}

{"content": "NEW FAIRFIELD \u2014 More than 50 people filled the library community room Wednesday to tell zoning officials their thoughts about Airbnb rentals that have recently popped up around town.  The hearing was set up by the town\u2019s Zoning Commission to help members decide how to regulate the short-term rentals, which have increased this year mostly in communities surrounding Candlewood Lake.  Those who spoke Wednesday were split between homeowners who say the online rental service has helped them keep or improve their home and residents who contend the renters often pack large groups into small houses and strain septic systems, crowd parking or disturb permanent neighbors.  \u201cEvery weekend we have new neighbors and almost every weekend for them it\u2019s like the Fourth of July, with fireworks and parties,\u201d said one lake resident, who showed commission members a listing for a three-bedroom home down her street that advertises the capacity to sleep 10 people.                              Other residents said they have had as many as 18 people come stay in small houses on the lake and have issues with loud music, trash left in the yard or even renters who use the bathroom outside or run naked through the neighborhood.  But some homeowners in the crowd who rent their homes on Airbnb said they have had no or minimal issues with renters, who are vetted through a review system by the website. The residents said using Airbnb has allowed them to keep their home as taxes rise and that renters help New Fairfield\u2019s economy by shopping and going to restaurants in town.    \u201cI think it\u2019s up to the owners to manage,\u201d said Rob White, who told the crowd he has been renting his home for three years. \u201cIf a neighbor never tells me the issue, I can\u2019t manage the situation. Instead of pushing away this sharing economy, I think neighbors have to talk to each other\u2026There\u2019s enough opportunity for everyone.\u201d  White suggested creating a registry of owners who rent their homes so neighbors can contact them with any problems. Others in the crowd suggested having homeowners associations weigh in on any regulations or requiring the homes to register as Airbnb rentals.  Right now, only bed and breakfasts, which require a special permit, are defined in New Fairfield\u2019s regulations, not Airbnbs, Zoning Enforcement Officer Evan White has said.  Commission Chairman John Moran told the crowd members will begin to discuss the issue at next month\u2019s meeting and will take a few months to decide on a regulation, or no regulation, about the rentals.  aquinn@newstimes.com", "id": "598"}
{"content": "Aug. 02--NAPA -- According to NFL Network, Worley was found passed out inside his car in Philadelphia near the Eagles' facility early in the morning on April 15 and police administered a taser on him. A gun was also found, and Worley was arrested on DUI suspicion and weapons and disorderly conduct charges, according to NFL.com.Worley, a 2016 third-round pick of the Panthers, spent his first two seasons in Carolina before being traded to Philadelphia in mid-March this year. The Eagles wasted no time releasing him after his arrest, and Jon Gruden swooped in for the talented cornerback who's currently seeing first-team reps with Gareon Conley sidelined a couple weeks with a hip strain.\"This opportunity, it was amazing for me,\" Worley said Thursday after Day 6 of training camp. \"Just to be able to get another opportunity because many people don't get a second chance. I was just blessed to be able to get another chance and just make the best of it.\"Honestly, I just took it as a learning experience,\" he said of his arrest. \"It's something that happened. You can't change the past. Just like plays on the field, you can't change what happened. You just have to move on to the next one. I was thankful when I talked to Coach Gruden on the phone. It was a very passionate conversation. He was understanding. I mean, people make mistakes in life. It's not about the mistake, it's about whether you learn from it and what you do continue to go forward in future.\"Worley said he hasn't heard anything from the NFL regarding potential discipline. He'll proceed as the Raiders' No. 2 cornerback with Conley out, starting opposite Rashaan Melvin in a defensive backfield that underwent serious overhaul this offseason after an abysmal 2017.After Worley's arrest, Gruden consulted a handful of people to gauge Worley's character, including college teammate and current Raiders safety Karl Joseph. The two spent three years together at West Virginia and both entered the league in 2016. Joseph and others vouched for the 23-year-old cornerback, so Gruden felt comfortable bringing him on board so soon after a potentially concerning incident.\"I knew he could come in and help us at that position,\" Joseph said in June. \"We need some help in that position, so when (Gruden) asked me about him I was excited. That's my brother. We played almost all of our years in college together. So when he asked me, I co-signed for him immediately. He's a heck of a player.\"Joseph eased Worley's transition at the start, catching him up to speed on what Gruden and Co. expected even if Joseph only met the staff a couple weeks before Worley did.\"He's a savvy guy. I think he's put what happened to him behind,\" Gruden said Monday. \"I think he's focused now.\"\"He's played a lot of football. He's an experienced guy. He's big and long,\" defensive coordinator Paul Guenther said Sunday. \"He's really starting to pick up the system the last couple of days.\"Worley played in a similar defense with the Panthers, he said, so the majority of his learning curve has dealt with terminology. He feels most comfortable at outside cornerback, which is where the Raiders have played him while Marcus Gilchrist and Shareece Wright get looks in the slot.As he adjusts to Guenther's defense, Worley has leaned on the likes of cornerback Leon Hall and safety Reggie Nelson, two veterans who played under Guenther in Cincinnati.\"Not only have they played in Coach Guenther's defense, they've played in the NFL for a long time,\" Worley said. \"Guys that have double digit years, you have to soak up the knowledge whenever you can. Ask them questions even when you may not have necessarily a question, just being able to see how they see it and does it relate to yours.\"Worley is with his third team entering his third year. He's already spent more time with the Raiders than he did with the Eagles, and would like to keep that going.He evidently has a chance to make an immediate impact in the secondary if training camp reps are any indication. If Conley can't get healthy, the Raiders will count on Worley to not only show up on the field, but stay out of trouble off it.\"I've been an open book,\" Worley said. \"Really just letting the coaches and the players around me just make their imprint. And I adjust accordingly. Just go out there and show them that I am for the team, being able to continue to work, make the plays that come my way, continue to compete and show the guys that I am here to work.\"___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "599"}
{"content": "July 31--Two people, including a man jailed in another county, have been linked to the slaying of a man whose body was found in a remote ravine two months after his Thanksgiving disappearance, authorities said.The development revealed this week by San Jose police provides new clarity in the death of 41-year-old Billy Ray Scott, who detectives and prosecutors now believe was killed Nov. 23. Police launched an investigation into the \"suspicious disappearance\" in January, after he was reported missing.Scott, who was known by the nickname \"Tank,\" was found the following month in an unincorporated portion of Almaden Valley.\"The investigation led detectives to a rural area of Santa Clara County where Scott's body was located in a ravine,\" police said.The Santa Clara County Medical Examiner-Coroner's Office confirmed that Scott's official date of death was Feb. 2, when his body was found. A formal of cause of death is still pending.Police later pointed their focus toward an apartment near Moorpark and Kingman avenues they linked to the death, and inside \"a crime scene was located,\" according to the news release.\"Detectives believe that Scott was killed inside the apartment and later discarded in the ravine,\" police said.They eventually identified Eugene Frazier, 44, and Renee Nicole Wilson, 44, both of San Jose, as suspects in Scott's death.Frazier, who is suspected of killing Scott, was formally charged with one count of murder in Santa Clara County, but he has been in jail custody in Monterey County since January for unrelated charges that include attempted murder, kidnapping, torture and possession of crystal methamphetamine. Jail records show he is being held there on $3.65 million bail.Frazier has a lengthy criminal history in Santa Clara County, with several convictions involving primarily drug crimes, as well as burglary and assault.Wilson, suspected of helping Frazier conceal evidence, was arrested July 24 in Los Banos by the SJPD Covert Response Unit. She is being held without bail at the Elmwood women's jail in Milpitas on a felony charge of being an accessory after the fact. Her criminal history in the county involves assault and drug crimes.Because Scott's official date of death is in February, his case becomes the 15th homicide of the year in San Jose. There were 18 homicide recorded at the same point in 2017.Police said there is no evidence the suspects and victim knew each other directly, but noted that Scott was not targeted at random.Additional details were not immediately released. Police reports and other documents in the public case file have been sealed by the Superior Court at the request of Detective Wayne Smith.In his request to seal the files, Smith wrote to the court and stated that revealing details of the investigation now would compromise detectives' pursuit of possible additional suspects and prompt them to \"destroy valuable evidence,\" and endanger people who spoke to police for the case.Anyone with information about the case can contact Detective Sgt. John Barg or Detective Wayne Smith in the SJPD homicide unit at 408-277-5283 or leave a tip with Silicon Valley Crime Stoppers at 408-947-STOP or svcrimestoppers.org.

{"content": "Aug. 01--SAN JOSE -- \"After the bids were opened Monday afternoon, we were notified that the city was the winning bidder,\" said Kim Walesh, San Jose's director of economic development. \"We are overjoyed that we won the bidding.\"The 4.3-acre site that San Jose is poised to buy is located at 435 S.

The price San Jose paid for the property wasn't disclosed.San Jose officials believe it's vital for the city to control the site because it wants to be able to expand the convention center at some point.\"Even after the expansion of the convention center by adding 125,000 square feet for $130 million, we already don't have the opportunity to compete for a lot of conventions,\" said Nanci Klein, the city's deputy director of economic development. \"There are trade shows and tech shows that want to come here to San Jose but can't because we just don't have the space.\"The property is owned by an agency that is the successor to the former San Jose Redevelopment Agency, which now is defunct after decisions several years ago by the state government. The city essentially was obliged to buy a site that it once controlled through the redevelopment agency.\"We have a small convention center for a city of our size,\" Walesh said.The currently booming Silicon Valley economy, coupled with an upswing in passenger traffic at San Jose International Airport, could bolster the view that the convention center could be in more demand.\"We have argued all along that this land needs to be used for a public purpose,\" Walesh said. \"It would be a public purpose to expand the convention center.\"___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "602"}
{"content": "Memphis Grizzlies Veteran Point Guard Mike Conley attended Team USA Mini camp on Thursday afternoon. Seeing Conley on the floor again made me think about a bounce back season, and also what could lie ahead.Mike Conley Jr., is coming off of one of the toughest seasons of his career where he played in only 12 of the 82 games in 2017. A season that put a nagging injury to rest with surgery. For years Conley described the bone spur in his left heel as a \u201cgolf ball,\u201d but that was fixed when the spur was removed this past season.For years Conley rehabbed his heel without the surgery, and team doctors told Conley that he wouldn\u2019t need the procedure, but the situation progressed.The injury forced Conley to sit out one of the longest seasons in franchise history, it felt like at least. A year of \u2018tanking\u2019 after so much postseason success for Memphis almost felt unreal, but it is the reality of the NBA or any successful franchise. The roster ages, injuries happen, and then there is the grooming of young talent.Last season Memphis groomed some pretty good young talent in the absence of Conley, but no one is taking Conley\u2019s spot in 2018. Yeah, Andrew Harrison progressed last season, and Memphis spent their 32nd overall pick on a young Point Guard in Jevon Carter, but this is still Conley\u2019 team.MEMPHIS, TN \u2013 MARCH 17: Mike Conley #11 of the Memphis Grizzlies lifts weights before the game on March 17, 2018 at FedExForum in Memphis, Tennessee.Where ever this team wants to go, Conley has to take them to that level. This is no shade at Memphis\u2019 All-Star Center Marc Gasol, but it is a guards league right now, and Conley has the tools to take Memphis to new heights.What still lingers medically for Conley is what haunts fans, and at the age of 30, those things still lingering around Conley are slamming the door of his prime shut.MEMPHIS, TN \u2013 JANUARY 10: (EDITORS NOTE: This image has been converted to black and white) Mike ConleyAn achilles that struggles to adapt to the beginning of a long NBA season. The achilles was the first diagnosis from a distance this past season when Conley went down, before finding out about the spur.

{"content": "Aug. 02--Cubs manager Joe Maddon and some players were unaware of the planned anti-violence march to Wrigley Field on Thursday that will shut down a part of Lake Shore Drive.Since Maddon and several players live downtown, it could impede their ability to get to the park for the 7:05 p.m. game against the Padres. Most arrive at the park several hours early, but they could be affected by the closing of Lake Shore and the march up Clark Street.After learning of the protest, Maddon said he was considering riding his bike to Wrigley, and at least one player said he might just take the \"L\" train.The protest is planned to begin in the southbound lanes of Lake Shore Drive at Briar Place at about 4 p.m. and head north to Belmont Avenue, where marchers will exit and head west to Clark Street before turning north and heading to Wrigley.One reporter came up with the idea of putting up players at the Hotel Zachary across the street from Wrigley Field on Wednesday night, but it's too late to do that.Cubs spokesman Julian Green advised fans last week to seek alternate routes to the game to avoid Lake Shore Drive.psullivan@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "604"}
{"content": "July 30--Before anyone on the North Side dismisses Alex Rodriguez as a pot-stirring interloper, remember that A-Rod has been prescient before regarding Cubs pitcher Yu Darvish.In the midst of the Astros annihilating Darvish for four earned runs in 1 2/3 innings against the Dodgers in Game 7 of the World Series last Nov. 1, Rodriguez immediately tweeted that Houston hitters' body language suggested \"perhaps he was tipping his pitches.\"A month later, an anonymous Astros hitter confirmed as much to Sports Illustrated, explaining that the way Darvish re-gripped the ball in his glove determined whether he was throwing a slider or a fastball.Say this for Rodriguez: Love him or hate him as a broadcaster, spending 22 years in the majors as a player qualifies him to interpret nuances at the ballpark not everybody notices. So it figures that Rodriguez's controversial comments about Darvish's rehabilitation methods Sunday on ESPN came either from observation, experience or -- more likely -- an individual in the Cubs organization who maintains a relationship with one of the sport's most polarizing personalities.\"When you have a guy that signed an enormous contract and is sitting down and you walk in the training room and he's got two trainers working on him, you should be in Arizona somewhere getting treated,\" Rodriguez said about Darvish, seemingly out of the blue.Rodriguez suggested that Cubs teammates upset with the coddling of Darvish, who has missed more than two months with right triceps tendinitis, threaten to cause a rift in the clubhouse. During a nationally televised broadcast, Rodriguez gave voice to whispers that began locally shortly after the Cubs placed Darvish on the disabled list in May with the flu. He said something more unexpected than outrageous, wondering aloud whether Darvish's feelings were as tender as his right arm, a lingering question since the former Japanese star arrived in Chicago.What Rodriguez intimated rings true in every professional sport: Injured players are best to stay away from the guys fighting through aches and pains every day to stay in the lineup.Unintentionally, Rodriguez also might have done Darvish a favor.The player best known for having a fragile psyche since signing a six-year, $126 million free-agent contract suddenly became the Cubs player most likely to be defended this week. Even if some Cubs quietly have rolled their eyes over Darvish or privately questioned the pitcher's approach to rehab, as Rodriguez hinted, publicly teammates will have his back. The winning culture created by three straight National League Championship Series appearances all but assures that kind of protection throughout the organization.The Cubs enjoyed an off day Monday, but the first time a teammate responds to Rodriguez's assertion, Darvish likely will receive the unqualified support he craves. Teammates typically rally around a player outsiders question. That's the way championship teams limit distractions. This gives the Cubs a chance to proclaim their faith in Darvish to anybody who doubts it, a potential boost of confidence for a pitcher who appears to lack it. Just look at how quickly Cubs manager Joe Maddon sprung to Darvish's defense.\"I totally disagree with that,\" Maddon said Sunday night after a reporter relayed Rodriguez's comments made during the Cubs-Cardinals broadcast. \"Everyone knows what's going on. We know there is an injury there. We support his recovery. Everybody in there knows and everyone in the coaches room knows also, throughout the organization. It's unfortunate that it was relayed that way, but it's not true.\"Cubs President Theo Epstein has sounded just as supportive of Darvish at every turn. The only evidence to the contrary came when the Cubs traded for Cole Hamels, a proven left-hander acquired to give the rotation stability the Cubs know Darvish no longer offers. The Cubs did the right thing in demoting Tyler Chatwood to the bullpen and leaving Mike Montgomery in the rotation -- for now. They would be wise to continue surveying the pitching market until Tuesday's trade deadline passes and not necessarily count on Darvish, who hasn't pitched in a major-league game since May 20. Anything Darvish provides at this point should be considered a bonus.Physically, only Darvish and his doctors can say where he is after a 23-pitch bullpen session Friday. Psychologically, the pitcher can get stronger by being portrayed as weak on national television. Nobody really knows how much of Darvish's rehab includes recovering from the shoulders up. What irony it would be if A-Rod's insinuations coincide with Darvish's improvement.So the Cubs can curse A-Rod now as long as they're willing to thank him later.dhaugh@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "605"}
{"content": "Aug. 01--Vrushank and Pooja Joshi just moved to Buffalo Grove and they plan to stay put.The couple -- he's a computer systems administrator and she's a physical therapist -- looked for months for a house that was affordable, big enough to accommodate a growing family and near schools with the level of quality they envisioned for their toddler daughter and future children.\"We could have gone further north and gotten a bigger yard, but communities with newer houses -- well, the schools are newer too,\" says Vrushank Joshi, 39. Buffalo Grove's established schools, convenient location and community -- the pair have a circle of friends in the area -- put a bull's-eye on the northwest suburb. At the end of June, the Joshis moved into a four-bedroom, 45-year-old house that cost $395,000 and is livable for now, though they may update the space down the road.The Joshis are part of the wave of homebuyers who took part in the recently concluded spring homebuying season. Here's a glimpse of how the Chicago-area market's behaving, from sale prices to supply.In the nine-county Chicago metro area, the median sale price is up 4.3 percent in 2018 to $242,500, according to Illinois Realtors, the state's largest trade association of agents and brokers. And houses are selling faster: Houses now take about 47 days to sell, down from 53 days last year. In the city of Chicago, the median sale price rose 4.9 percent to $299,000, and houses are selling in about 44 days, down slightly from 46 days last year.Still, sales figures could have been better, if more houses had been available. The total number of sales this year dropped 2.9 percent in the larger metro area and 3.1 percent in the city of Chicago.Analysts and agents say that while sellers have given up on timing the market perfectly, today's strong market has many sellers thinking they have plenty of time to hold on to their property and sell at a desirable price. In addition, sellers may hold off because they are debating the logistics of selling and then being unable to buy quickly and move to their next house.Also, supply for the smallest units -- studios and one-bedroom condos -- is tightening as some owners simply save up the down payment for their next place and then rent their first place, says Alex Haried, an agent with online realty firm Redfin's Chicago office.\"Fees for selling are prohibitive sometimes,\" says Haried. \"If you're looking at paying 5 percent to 6 percent commission, that's onerous, especially if you only bought a few years ago. These buyers have gotten a few promotions and can save the down payment for the bigger place without counting on equity from the first place.\"That said, generational turnover is accelerating, as the oldest baby boomers finally relinquish their houses, says Joel Raynes, a Wilmette-based realty agent who is president-elect of the North Shore-Barrington Association of Realtors. \"People who've lived in their houses forever are now selling,\" he says. That translates to a bumper crop of split-levels and ranch houses that are easily renovated to the open-concept layouts popular with young families.Many first-time buyers share the Joshis' perspective that it's smarter to find the right house to grow into than to get a toehold in the market with a starter house, only to see much of that early equity sapped by transaction costs a few years later when moving up to a larger house.\"When we started looking, I had in mind a starter house, but it was so exhausting to look that we thought, no, one and done,\" says Vrushank Joshi.Speaking of exhausting, bargain hunters seeking an investment property must search far and wide for properties worth spiffing up for a quick resale or to rent. \"Investors were out in full force the last few years, and in smaller communities, they've snapped up a lot of what they could,\" says John Lawrence, owner of Weichert Realtors Nickel Group, which operates in the near western suburbs of Oak Park and River Forest. \"It's great that they've improved many functionally obsolete homes, but there are only so many of them.\"Which Chicago neighborhoods, suburbs are hot?Certain factors predict whether neighborhoods heat up or cool down, experts say. For instance, hot areas tend to offer family homes that are move-in ready, walkable access to neighborhood amenities, public transit for errands as well as commuting, and trees and natural features that are integrated into the neighborhood.Not-so-hot neighborhoods tend to have had previously high turnover that's running out of steam, be difficult to access or include large homes whose use is tightly restricted by zoning or homeowners' associations (for instance, community associations restrict short-term rentals).Zillow reports that for the Chicago metropolitan area, the current median home value is $218,00, a 5.5 percent increase in the past year.Based on home value increases alone, Zillow reports that these are the 10 hottest neighborhoods in Chicago, based on median homes values between May 2017 and May 2018.1. Bronzeville home values up 20.3 percent to median home value of $204,100.2. Mayfair home values up 16.3 percent to median value of $327,600.3. Burnside home values up 16 percent to $125,700.4. Woodlawn home values up 15.9 percent to $121,600.5. Tri-Taylor home values up 15.9 percent to $222,200.6. Chinatown home values up 15.4 percent to $277,900.7. Georgetown home values up 15.3 percent to $192,400.8. Belmont Gardens home values up 13.2 percent to $254,000.9. Harbor Side home values up 13.2 percent to $114,800.10. North Austin home values up 13.1 percent to $179,900.According to May 2018 data from the Mainstreet Organizaton of Realtors, whose agents cover south suburban and western Cook County, Lake County and DuPage County, these are eight of the hottest suburbs, in alphabetical order, based on time on market and median sale price.1. Antioch: Time on market down 32.3 percent, median sale price up 29.8 percent.2. Addison: Time on market down 47.4 percent, median price up 5.6 percent.3.

{"content": "The San Jose Sharks have lost out on another forward they were targeting. LW Jeff Skinner has been traded to Buffalo from Carolina for a 2019 Second Round pick, a third rounder and a sixth rounder in 2020, and forward prospect Cliff Pu.Cross another one off the list. Per Sports Illustrated, the San Jose Sharks lost out on Jeff Skinner, who was a top target for Doug Wilson this offseason. This adds to the list of guys who are not coming to San Jose.As I said in a previous article \u2013 I believe the San Jose Sharks are done this offseason. They will go into the 2018-2019 season with the team in place now. However, they were/are leaving themselves enough cap room to make a move during the season probably closer to the deadline.Former Carolina Hurricane turned Buffalo Sabre Jeff Skinner, logically speaking, was going to be a top target. The 26-year-old forward was on the top of everyone\u2019s list. Carolina made it known he was available, and a litany of teams had been bidding for his services.Skinner would really have helped the San Jose Sharks. In fact, he would have put them over the top. Is Skinner a difference maker in the same class as an Artemi Panerin, no, but adding another 50-60 point player to their top six would have made this team as formidable as any in the Western Conference.Skinner\u2019s style of play would have fit right in here with the San Jose Sharks and would have made the top two lines as competitive as any in the Pacific Division, and frankly, the entire NHL. Skinner would have added over 20 goals, as he\u2019s averaged over that during his NHL career.And I would have loved to have seen what a guy like Jeff Skinner can do when paired with Tomas Hertl and Logan Couture.Want your voice heard? Join the Blades Of Teal team!Skinner could be the first domino that falls in what will be a wave of trades heading into training camp. There are still major stars on the block all around the NHL, guys like Erik Karlsson, Max Pacioretty, and \u201cThe Bread man\u201d Artemi Panarin are all reportedly available, and this could be the first of many deals made before puck drop on the 2018-2019 season.", "id": "607"}

{"content": "July 31--The decadence of college football's facilities arms race boggles the mind.Alabama's practice palace is outfitted with mini-waterfalls that pour into a hydrotherapy pool. Clemson's has a nine-hole miniature golf course. Oregon's has an auditorium with seats covered in Ferrari leather.And now, here comes Northwestern, once the laughingstock of Big Ten football, with a jock Taj Mahal whose $270 million price tag reportedly makes it the conference's most expensive practice facility. You wonder what goes through the mind of kids struggling to pay off their student loans. Does it make sense to spend more than a quarter of a billion dollars on a facility that only a small fraction of the university's students will enter on a typical day?Whatever the answer, this much is clear: The new field house and athletics center, which will be dedicated Wednesday, is a distinguished, sometimes-breathtaking, work of architecture. Its calling card is not shiny toys designed to lure recruits, but structural drama that takes full advantage of its spectacular lakefront site. Lithe arches support a futuristic dome that spans a vast indoor practice field. Towering glass walls reveal jaw-dropping views of Lake Michigan.As Northwestern football coach Pat Fitzgerald told an interviewer last spring, \"Why do you need waterfalls inside when you have waves outside?\"Designed by the Chicago office of Perkins+Will and located at the northeast corner of Northwestern's Evanston campus, the completed structure houses the training facilities of seven sports besides football (women's lacrosse, field hockey and cross-country, plus men's and women's soccer and swimming and diving). It should be nicknamed \"The House that Pat and Pat Built.\"In 2011, with Michigan threatening to poach Fitzgerald, Northwestern committed to replace its aging football practice facility, inconveniently located a mile and a half northwest of campus. The other Pat -- billionaire former Aon executive Patrick Ryan, whose name graces the stadium -- pledged millions of dollars for a top-drawer new facility. Fitzgerald stayed.Thus rose the new building, which is actually two interconnected structures: the Patrick G. and Shirley W. Ryan Fieldhouse, which contains the practice field and had a soft opening last spring, and the brand-new Mark and Kimbra Walter Athletics Center, home to an athletes' dining hall, coaches' offices and meeting rooms. Mark Walter is CEO of the Guggenheim Partners financial services firm and chairman of the Los Angeles Dodgers.Together the buildings form an L-shaped structure that interlocks with the L-shaped Henry Crown Sports Pavilion, a stolid recreation and athletics building that was partly demolished to make way for the new facility. The combined buildings have an enormous footprint, not unlike a small convention center. Buildings like these tend to be massive, monolithic and inward-turning -- in short, deadening to everything around them. But in the skilled hands of Perkins+Will's chief designer Ralph Johnson, who worked with design principal Bryan Schabel and senior project manager Chris Hale, the Ryan-Walter center is anything but a hulking eyesore.Johnson, whose portfolio includes the international terminal at O'Hare and the Boeing headquarters along the Chicago River, has long excelled at turning out modernist buildings that sensitively respond to their sites, but introduce something fresh. He does it again here with materials (limestone, glass and aluminum) that relate well to surrounding campus structures. To break up the building's mass, he employs tried-and-true elements of his visual language -- among them, cantilevered window bays, stiltlike columns and facade wrappers that resemble Mobius strips.The center may be futuristic, but, unlike the flying saucer addition to Soldier Field, it doesn't look like it parachuted in from outer space.The big event, the domed practice field, is something fresh in Johnson's catalog, responding to the need for a ceiling that would be high enough for field goal kicks and punts yet low enough to adhere to Evanston's height limit. Its rhythmic steel arches -- set 30 feet apart, like the major yard lines of a football field -- span an impressive 240 feet. To the north, a curtainlike wall of glass, 44 feet tall, hangs from the roof, opening stunning views of Lake Michigan and an adjoining public beach.As Fitzgerald said, who needs waterfalls?Besides \"wow,\" the words that come to mind are power and grace.Even if you never set foot inside, the towering glass walls let you witness the structural drama from the outside.The building responds equally well to its natural setting. Part of its second floor cantilevers beyond the rest of the facade, making way for a new stretch of lakefront trail that links to an existing campus trail. Pedestrians and cyclists already are using it. Tall, handsomely sculpted concrete walls protect the path and the building from the pounding of Lake Michigan. Seating is nicely integrated into the lower parts of the walls.Besides the practice field, interior highlights include a tall, south-facing entry hall to the Walter Athletics Center, which is outfitted with a large video display panel and a monumental flight of stairs. The building also contains a two-story athletes' dining hall with fabulous views and the offices of coaches and athletic director Jim Phillips, which overlook adjacent practice fields and the distant Chicago skyline. Throughout the clean-lined interior, adjoining spaces share natural light and views, enhancing the sense of expansiveness.If there's a weakness, it's the profusion of long, narrow corridors. But they're spiffed up with attractive graphics that use lots of Northwestern purple and spell out messages like \"Win Our Bowl Game.\"For all its strengths, the facility is filled with contradictions.While the carefully composed, metal-and-glass facades project an image of openness, the aforementioned southern entry is reserved for athletes, coaches, athletic administrators and recruits. (A public lobby is located at the field house's northwest corner.) The practice field is intentionally placed on the second floor, not just to fit onto the tight site, but also to keep the field out of eyeshot of other teams' spies.And while the building is far more integrated with the campus than the remote Ryan Field practice facility, it forms a kind of parallel universe to the campus proper, with its athletes-only dining hall and study center. In the Crown pavilion, the running track and basketball courts, which were open to recreational users, had the prime lake views. In the new building, the courts are underground and the track is at ground-level. They have no windows, a shift that speaks volumes about who sits atop the campus hierarchy.Northwestern administrators insist that the field house will be used for campuswide events like a dance marathon.It also remains to be seen whether the center helps the university recruit better athletes and improve its on-field performance. But the building itself performs beautifully, despite the fraught issues it raises about the rising influence of major college sports.I haven't been to every noteworthy football facility in the country, but Pete Thamel of Yahoo Sports has. Last spring, after a preview of the field house, he wrote, \"In terms of size, spectacle and spending, Northwestern has sprinted past the biggest names in the facilities arms race.\"The high quality and creativity on display in the completed field house and athletics center add weight to that judgment.Eat your heart out, Alabama, Clemson, Oregon.You, too, Michigan and Notre Dame.Blair Kamin is a Tribune critic.bkamin@chicagotribune.comMORE ARCHITECTURE COVERAGE FROM BLAIR KAMIN___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "609"}
{"content": "July 29--Back in 1997, I watched a guy named Rick Stone appear in a Black Ensemble Theater tribute to Otis Redding. A few weeks later, I went back to see another show there. Stone was taking my ticket. I went back again; Stone was ushering.For a time, he was the theater's janitor.But in 2003, he got his own star vehicle: \"Howlin' at the Moon,\" a Jackie Taylor tribute to the blues great Howlin' Wolf, known for numbers like \"Wang Dang Doodle\" and \"Howlin' for My Darling.\" Stone's voice was smoother and silkier than Wolf's own instrument, but he had an innate understanding of a great bluesman always known for his \"country\" sensibility, and who often was mocked by his peers in big-city Chicago.A few weeks after that, I went back to another show. Stone was ushering again.I lay all that out to say that Taylor's \"Rick Stone the Blues Man,\" the loosey-goosey summer attraction at Black Ensemble, is a tribute to a man with a long history at this particular theater. Stone has not grown any shorter with the passing years, and his famously gangly frame has not lost any of its ability to shimmy, duck, weave or otherwise move uniquely through time and space. Nor has he lost his humility. Nor his voice, except that his instrument now is closer to that of Howlin' Wolf.\"Rick Stone the Blues Man\" imagines that Stone owns a blues club and has invited some of his closest friends, who also happen to be this theater's most-trusted regulars, including Dwight Neal (who played Muddy Waters in that Howlin' Wolf show back in 2003), Theo Huff, Rhonda Preston, Cynthia Carter, Kelvin Davis and Lamont \"Harmonica Man\" Harris. We, the audience, are at the club. There is a little light narrative tension -- one of the performers is carrying on with a younger woman in the back, another is dealing with post-Vietnam stress. But it's mostly just artists singing blues standards under the stellar musical direction of Robert Reddrick.That's pretty much it. If you prefer reserved comfy seats to a crowded club, and if you've got out-of-towners here this summer who want a taste of the old-school Chicago blues, roll on down to Ricky's Place. You will be made most welcome. At one point, you'll be asked to talk to all the people around you. I had a good time with that. Nice, nice people everywhere.Act 2 really gets free-form, which might explain the lengthy running time. At one point, it seemed to be closing time for Ricky's Place, but then everything opened up again. You don't entirely get the trajectory of the night. And, frankly, the semi-fictional personas in the piece didn't interest me anywhere near as much as the life stories of the actual performers. I just wanted to hear about them.Stone (who was in the movie \"Cooley High\" and who went through some stuff thereafter) grew up with Taylor in Cabrini-Green; the two were hardly the only significant artists who grew up in that housing project.It is Stone's place, and thus he feels free to play himself. \"Is Cabrini-Green in the house?\" he asked Saturday afternoon, after describing his friendship, some 40 years ago, with Taylor's brother, Joe.It was. And glad to be with him.

While Dawkins was always viewed as a player that seemed like would earn a spot in a matter of time, Owens has been one of those debatable players that arguably took a little longer than expected.Seeing him turn down the invitation to be there in person in Canton may seem controversial, but also knowing the wideout\u2019s ways from his NFL career, nobody should be all that surprised by the decision. At the end of the day, all that matters is Owens will finally be recognized as one of the greatest receivers to ever play the game of football, and when looking at his numbers from over the years, it\u2019s easy to see why.As for his limited time in the City of Brotherly Love, Owens will always be considered one of those special players in which fans will always wonder what could have been if things didn\u2019t go downhill during the 2005 season.

{"content": "OUTFIT:REVOLVE CLOTHING\u00a0Dress ~\u00a0ON SALE!SAINT LAURENT\u00a0BagCHLO\u00c9\u00a0BootsI spent part of my weekend at the 3rd Street Promenade for a little Christmas shopping. By far my least favorite place to go because it\u2019s always so packed. But, we decided to make a day out of it and go ice skating as well. The weather\u2019s been very random due to the California fires so I wore a dress with long sleeve\u2019s to keep me somewhat warm as the day went on. I purchased this\u00a0Revolve Clothing Dress\u00a0on sale during Black Friday week. It\u2019s slightly too big for me, which is unfortunate because I can\u2019t return it. However, I tried to make it work without looking like a sack of potatoes. I\u2019ve wanted a dress like this for the longest time. I love anything off the shoulder, but the leg slit and button details made this super cute. This isn\u2019t really a dress you can wear with other fashion items it\u2019s more a stand alone piece. Then I gave the outfit some contract with gold and black accents for my accessories and shoes. Overall, happy with this dress and I will definitely wear it for more casual days like when I go shopping.Be sure to watch my vlog of full day shopping below or\u00a0HERE.", "id": "615"}

I really love how simple this outfit is, but it\u2019s still very cute. I added a baseball hat to make it a little more sporty. Also, because I was going for a \u201cblue\u201d theme, I thought it went nicely with the rest of my outfit. The top is actually a long sleeve shirt from Forever 21 that I\u00a0cut and styled myself. I cut it at an angle for a more interesting detail. I think this shirt looks so cute off the shoulder too! Thank you Mama for my nice collarbones! I wore this shirt with slightly ripped light washed denim. I wanted to continue the theme of a little skin showing but not too much. A rule I sometimes follow that I made up myself\u2026 is skin on top and no skin on bottm and vise versa. I am showing some skin on top so I decided to keep it casual on the bottom.

{"content": "DANBURY \u2014 Local foresters are examining dozens of potentially dangerous trees across Danbury after a massive tree fell and killed a 45-year-old man Tuesday along Padanaram Road.  The city\u2019s forestry division has identified 46 trees along city roads this summer that could pose a risk and need to be removed, Public Works Director Antonio Iadarola said Wednesday morning.  Crews are in the process of removing those trees this week, in addition to 40 others that were taken down shortly after severe thunderstorms rolled through the area in May causing a macroburst and a tornado that toppled hundreds of trees, damaged dozens of homes and killed two, he added.  But officials are still trying to determine who has responsibility for the large tree \u2014 which was at least 3 feet in diameter \u2014 that fell on a pickup truck on Padanaram Road around 9 a.m. Tuesday killing the passenger, Walter Cardenas Salinas.                              Padanaram is owned by the state of Connecticut and doesn\u2019t fall under the city\u2019s responsibility, Iadarola stressed.  Kevin Nursick, a spokesman for the state Department of Transportation, said state officials are aware of the accident and investigating whether the tree was on the state\u2019s right of way or if it was located on private property.  \u201cWe have to have the area surveyed to know for sure,\u201d Nursick said.  He added that area supervisors for the department are responsible for assessing roadways in their section for any safety concerns that might arise. But when the area surrounding Panadaram Road was last assessed by state officials wasn\u2019t immediately available Tuesday.    The crash shut down the road for most of Tuesday after bringing down power lines and a brief fire.  Edgar Nugra, who was identified by police as the driver of the 2014 Dodge Ram, said he saw the tree falling but didn\u2019t have time to react before it slammed into the truck. Nugra received minor injuries while Salinas was declared dead at the scene.  Matt Bartelme, the owner of Danbury-based Bart\u2019s Tree Service, said two people told him after the accident they saw the tree prior to the crash and that it had already been compromised and leaning against another tree in the area.  If the tree had been partially uprooted, he said, saturation from the more than 3 inches of rain the city received in the past week or so alone could have impacted the strength of the tree and contributed to it falling.  But Scott Clifford, who lives in the neighborhood, said it was only a matter of time before the tree fell. Several trees on the western edge of the road, which sit near the bank of the Padanaram Brook, have been undermined and are leaning over the roadway, he said.  \u201cThat area has very unstable soil that\u2019s been eroding and eventually all those trees are going to fall,\u201d he said.  Erosion near the brook was a concern raised by residents when Cotswald of Danbury, a local developer, had proposed building 37 single family units on property it owns near the brook that runs along Padanaram Road.  While the project was approved three years ago, the homes have yet to be built. An official with the city\u2019s assessors office said Tuesday that it appears the property near where the tree was located is owned by Costwald.  The developer had originally proposed giving the city the 6-acre parcel as open space, the official said, but land records indicate that a transfer has yet to take place.  Barteleme said it will likely be another six months or more before all the trees and branches impacted by the May storm have been addressed.  dperrefort@newstimes.com", "id": "617"}
{"content": "July 30--Two weeks after the brightest batch of homegrown artists commanded attention at Pitchfork Music Festival, fellow local Femdot is ready to claim his own space at Lollapalooza -- which will again take over Grant Park Thursday through Sunday.\"Saba and I played ball yesterday, we play ball all the time, and we were talking about it,\" the rapper, born Femi Adigun, says of his friend -- who played Pitchfork's Red stage July 20. \"He said it was crazy. He said the crowd was big as hell and the energy, they just feed off each other.\"Saba gave his friend a bit of advice too -- on how to be in the moment even though things leading up to the festival slot can be stressful, especially for independent artists, how to best set up the stage and make the most of your time slot.Femdot's Lollapalooza set marks his debut on the festival scene and biggest stage to date, having previously performed Red Bull Sound Select shows alongside the likes of Mick Jenkins and Smino. He says organizers were looking for local talent (though only 11 of the 180 acts have Chicago roots) and his name kept coming up.The performance also arrives just two months after the release of his debut LP, \"Delacreme 2\" -- a collection of 13 tracks built on layers of sound oscillating between drill and neo-soul, vivid spoken word and slick rhymes, as heard on tracks like \"Ryu\" and \"0 Somethin'.\" At Lollapalooza, the young rapper hopes to bring it to life -- enlisting a band of nine, which includes keys and accompanying vocalists to lay down the album's smooth harmonies and gospel-inspired fills.Nerves, however, are not part of his plan.In an interview with the Tribune only a year ago, he said he never thought he \"really sounded like a rapper for a long time.\" Now, his vocal approach sounds seasoned -- with a mix of brash emphasis and playful theatricality. Lyrically, he's channeled what he says speak to his \"Chicago experiences\" -- growing up in Evanston his first eight years, then Rogers Park, and spending time traveling the South and West sides with his siblings -- in storytelling that is flavored with ambition and ego, as well as redemption and understanding.Like many of the city's hottest musical exports, Adigun sharpened his skills while participating in Young Chicago Authors' Louder Than a Bomb spoken word and slam poetry events -- and will impart what he picked up along the way on the American Eagle stage on Saturday. He remembers seeing poet/activist Malcolm London on his first visit -- and the day its director, Kevin Coval, finally called him up to perform his piece, \"Straight-A Failures\" in 2012.\"It's Chicago, so there's this part of feeling like you need to prove yourself, but (Young Chicago Authors) wasn't like that. It's constructive,\" Adigun says of his early visits. \"They're not gonna gas you if you don't got it, but they're not gonna tear you down either.\"He says it was one of the first spaces he felt welcome, his expression as a budding artist heard and respected.\"It's motivational, it pushes you. You want to keep up with everyone else,\" he continues. \"Instead of feeling discouraged by everyone doing great things, you see they're your peers and that you can do that too.\"Adigun also credits Louder Than a Bomb for showing him the importance of stage presence and crowd interaction -- and for the built-in community and audience the platform aids in cultivating for all artists who grow out of it.\"Being there and learning how to do call-and-responses, seeing people exchange energy in the room and engage with the crowd -- you know, just having a lot of fun on that small stage. Rap, like doing spoken word, you have to sell that,\" he says of how it helped him begin to develop his performance style. \"Now I try to incorporate that into music, to try and capture that same feel with other singers and the set-up. The reality is the best shows are always the intimate ones. So how do you make each show seem as intimate as possible regardless of how many people are there? You have to win people over, you can't turn to every person in the seats and introduce yourself to make a fan. Maybe they'll become a fan after you get off.\"Such fans were at local label, Closed Sessions -- one that was quick to start curating the new \"Chicago sound,\" and also houses like the likes of Kweku Collins, Jamila Woods and Ajani Jones among others.After finishing a series of EP's, \"(u)no,\" \"to(u),\" \"thr(we)\" and \"fo(u)r\" within a year, Closed Sessions approached Femdot and his team in 2017, offering help with distribution and promotion of his next project. After talks, Adigun signed based on the label's willingness to help and support letting the artist keep the team he'd built around him.That team, in true Chicago fashion, is largely made up of friends such as engineer/producer Mike Wavvs, DJ Charles Lauste and others; friends that Femdot says are integral to his process.The artist's approach to crafting his sound is unique in that it feels closer to one that leans toward science-based experimentation than romanticized notions of songwriting and composition. Femdot's nature of precision -- a trait he's carried since graduating from DePaul University with a degree in biology, drives him to re-create what he hears in his head exactly -- or it doesn't see the light of day.He's still constantly \"studying\" -- testing his own rhymes over instrumentals by some of his biggest influences like J. Dilla and Jay Z. Dissecting different parts of songs he likes to figure out why he likes them and if he'd like them if he tried them his way, trying to get into the minds of other artists to understand the psychology behind all of it.\"I was always jealous of people who could just kind of write things,\" he says. \"For them it just comes together. I literally can't do that. It's annoying how much I think everything out, but they're like 'No I wish I could do something like that.' But science has a finish line, this is about not having a finish line.\"The first time I'm performing this project is at Lolla. I'm gonna have a ball.\"jroti@chicagotribune.comWhen: 12:50 p.m. SaturdayWhere: Lollapalooza, Grant ParkTickets: Tickets start at $120; official resale also available, www.lollapalooza.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "618"}

The search giant has become itself a verb in the places it has managed to proliferate and that universe may soon grow even further. Citing sources and internal documents, The Intercept reports Google has had a project underway since the spring of 2017 to launch a censored version of Google Search in China. An Android search app that will \"automatically identify and filter websites blocked by the Great Firewall,\" as well as \"blacklist sensitive queries,\" could reportedly launch in six to nine months, providing Chinese officials approve it. Moreover, Google hasn't launched hardware products in China. where Amazon (AMZN)  , Microsoft (MSFT)  and IBM (IBM)  have, with the help of local partners, made their public cloud platforms available. Getting even a fraction of the millions of Chinese smartphone users to Google search or Google Cloud \"would serve to provide Google with mountains of additional user data that it could leverage to enhance its products and services\" writes TheStreet's Eric Jhonsa, adding that China is leagues ahead of many countries in terms of machine learning, e-commerce, payments, gaming, video and messaging. Software is still a hot commodity and everybody is looking to get a piece. Diversified industrial products maker Fortive (FTV)  got in on the action this week as it said it would acquire private equity-backed facilities management software provider Accruent LLC for $2 billion in cash. Genstar acquired the company in 2016 for just $650 million, according to The Deal, a sister publication of TheStreet. That shows astounding growth and perhaps, a desire for an industrial company to dabble in some tech. For Fortive, which services everything from medical devices to fuel dispensing mechanisms, the deal is its seventh in the past two years, says Tom Terrarosa, including recent deals for former Danaher Corp. (DHR)  industrial unit Gordian Group Inc. for $775 million; the advanced sterilization products business of Johnson &amp; Johnson Inc. JNJ subsidiary Ethicon Inc. for about $2.7 billion.

{"content": "July 28--DENVER -- In one corner -- Rockies third baseman Nolan Arenado. Five-time Gold Glove winner over six big league seasons. In the other corner -- A's third baseman Matt Chapman, who in his first full big league season is already drawing comparisons to Arenado as he leads virtually all defensive categories at third base this season.But it goes deeper for these two, all the way back to high school.Before Chapman and Arenado were dropping jaws at major league stadiums around the country, the two were teammates at El Toro High in Lake Forest, California. Chapman, two years younger than Arenado, spent most of his time as the elder's back up until Arenado graduated following the 2009 season. Both were shortstops at the time, with Matt sitting back, observing, waiting for his chance.Chapman might have the most impressive physique on the A's these days to go along with his hustle. Arenado remembers the hustle from their teen years, but not the body.\"He was a good player who worked hard. He was a little guy, wasn't very big,\" Arenado said of Chapman. \"He's really big now. He's probably way better than me now.\"Chapman might not have the resume, but the numbers say he's better this year. Chapman is ahead of Arenado, and every other player in baseball for that matter in defensive runs saved with 23.Arenado has no idea what all these new analytical defensive stats mean, but he's watched Chapman put in work at third whenever he can this season. The eye test tells him all he needs to know.\"I don't know how that stuff works. I know he's saving a bunch of runs and having a great year. I don't think I have any, so I don't know how that works anymore,\" Arenado said. \"I feel like I've saved some runs. I just know I'm playing a good third base and he's playing a really good third base. I think he's beating me by a lot in those things.\"Though the numbers might say Chapman is better, the young A's star scoffed at the notion that he might be a better overall defender than Arenado, who he looked up to since their days in the same little league down in Southern California.\"I definitely credit a lot of things that I do to what he does,\" Chapman said. \"I kind of followed his lead. Tried to throw the ball as hard as him and catch it like him. I gotta give credit where credit is due.\"One quick search of their highlight reels on YouTube will show you that there's a lot of similarities in their styles of play. That's not be by accident.All those days backing up Arenado as a sophomore, Chapman used the five-time Gold Glover's as a model for his style, which he later molded into his own as he went on to college at Cal State Fullerton.\"He might do a little bit more of a jump throw on the back end and I'll do a little bit more of a fadeaway throw,\" Chapman said. \"He's a little bit bigger guy, I might be a little lighter on my feet.\"Friday night's game will mark the first time the two slick defenders have shared a field in the majors, and they'd be lying if they told you they won't taking a peak at how each other performs and trying to out-do each other this weekend.\"I hope he doesn't rob me of a hit,\"Arenado said. \"But I hope I rob him.\"___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "621"}
{"content": "July 27--REDDING -- The Carr Fire, which began Monday, has killed two firefighters, injured three more, destroyed 65 structures, scorched nearly 45,000 acres and is threatening thousands of homes across the city.\"It was like a tornado,\" said Joyce Cox-Sacco, of Redding. \"It was so horrific.\"From her home on Amethyst Way, Cox-Sacco watched from a distance Thursday night as firefighters battled the fire on a nearby ridge. But as darkness fell, she said, the fire started advancing quickly toward her house, and she knew she had to leave.By Friday, Cox-Sacco was boarding up the garage door of her house, which was ripped off, along with the roof, during the fire. The top of her chimney lay across the street, having been swept off by wind or debris as the fire barreled through her neighborhood.Friday evening, officials with Cal Fire, the state's firefighting agency, reiterated the danger facing Redding, and the region around the city of 91,000 people.\"These are extreme conditions,\" Cal Fire Chief Ken Pimlott said during a news conference. \"Evacuate. Evacuate. Evacuate. Leave before you are asked to leave.\"The fire continued to spread after Redding police early Friday issued mandatory evacuation orders for neighborhoods in the western part of the city of 91,000 people. The office of Shasta County Sheriff Tom Bosenko said 38,000 people were ordered to evacuate. Cars clogged roads late Thursday and into Friday. The blaze was only 3 percent contained by mid-day Friday.\"We've seen fire conditions and weather conditions like we've never seen before, \" said Mark Ghilarducci, director of the California Governor's Office of Emergency Services. \"It's quite an event to stay out in front of.\"Scott McLean, deputy chief of Cal Fire, said the fire was caused by a vehicle towing a trailer, possibly through some kind of mechanical failure. The agency reported that in addition to the 65 structures that were destroyed, 55 others were damaged and about 5,000 were still threatened by the blaze.\"It burned into the city limits last night with great velocity,\" McLean said. \"It caught a lot of people off guard. A lot of people had to be evacuated. It has the potential to take off again.\"Crews in the western part of Redding struggled through the day Friday setting backfires and cutting handlines to stop the spread into other neighborhoods.\"Everybody is working extremely hard,\" he said. \"We are picking our points where we are going to make our stands.\"While Cal Fire crews fought the blaze, Redding residents tried to make sense of the situation and decide whether they should evacuate the area.\"Things were going haywire,\" said Robert Hovey, who surveyed the damage Friday as he rode his bike around his neighborhood. Hovey said he received no emergency alerts on his phone, but his family followed Twitter for updates and heard that evacuations were recommended for west Redding. After seeing 30-foot-high flames less than a mile from his home, Hovey and his girlfriend went to his brother's house a few miles away in Anderson.\"Everyone was leaving,\" Hovey said, adding that traffic was building up on all the roads in the area. \"Traffic lights were going out behind us.\"Hovey's home still stood Friday, but by early evening, he was once again faced a possible evacuation as the fire shifted toward Anderson.The Carr Fire was the latest massive blaze to hit California this month. On Tuesday, Yosemite National Park officials evacuated thousands of visitors from the park at the height of tourist season. Although flames from the Ferguson Fire, which has been burning since July 13, have not entered the park boundaries, they generated massive amounts of unhealthy smoke and have come close, forced the closure of Highway 140 and threatened communities near the park, including Yosemite West, along with ancient sequoias in Merced Grove near Highway 120. By mid-day Friday, the Ferguson Fire had burned 45,911 acres. More than 3,800 firefighters with 261 engines, 16 helicopters and 79 bulldozers had the fire 29 percent contained. Park officials hoped to reopen by Sunday.A couple weeks after the Ferguson fire killed a Cal Fire bulldozer operator, whose bulldozer rolled down a steep hill while he worked near the flames at night, the Carr Fire also killed a bulldozer operator on Thursday. The news worsened Friday, as Cal Fire announced that a Redding fire inspector, Jeremy Stoke, was killed while battling the fire.Gov. Jerry Brown on Thursday declared a state of emergency in Shasta and Mariposa counties, along with Riverside County, where the Cranston Fire had burned 11,500 acres east of Hemet by Friday afternoon with only 3 percent containment.\"Our thoughts are with the loved ones of the 2 firefighters we lost fighting the #CarrFire &amp; with the many Californians who have lost their homes,\" Brown said in a Twitter message Friday. \"We are with you.\"This year's fire season in California is the worst in a decade. Through Thursday night, 289,727 acres -- an area roughly 10 times the size of the city of San Francisco -- had burned since Jan. 1 on federal, state and private lands, according to the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise.That total is 61 percent more than at this time during the previous 10 years, 2017 to 2008, when 180,076 acres had burned, on average, through July 27.At least three more months of dangerous fire conditions lay ahead for the state until November when the first winter rains normally come.The reason that this year is so bad, is largely due to the state's recent five-year drought, said Craig Clements, an associate professor of meteorology at San Jose State University who studies fire conditions.\"It's the fuels,\" said Clements. \"The fuels are so dry from the drought and this minimal year of winter precipitation. Because everything is so dry, you get an ignition and it goes crazy.\"Although California winter of 2016-17 was soaking, and ended the drought of the previous five years, the most recent winter was below-average, and there are millions of tons of dead trees, brushes, grass and brush across California. Add to that hot conditions, which have been getting increasingly hot due to climate change, particularly at night when fires in the past have died down, and the state faces a crisis, he said.\"It's the drying of the West,\" said Clements. \"Over the last 30 years we are seeing more acreage burned, and that correlates to increased temperatures across the West. As the climate is changing, we are getting more drought conditions, and that is drying out the fuels further, so you are seeing more massive, intense fires.\"Over last 10 years, 6.6 million acres has burned a year on average in the United States, according to federal statistics. That's double the 3.3 million acres that burned from 1997 to 1998.\"We should expect more fires in the next three months,\" said Clements. \"It's going to be a bad year. But every year is a bad year now.\"Meanwhile Friday, the Marin County Fire Department announced that three of its firefighters suffered burn injuries Thursday night while battling the Carr Fire. The three firefighters were attempting to save a structure when they experienced a \"sudden blast of heat\" from burning vegetation, according to the fire department.The three -- Scott Pederson, 37; Tyler Barnes 34; and Brian Cardoza, 26 -- were treated for burns to the ears, face and hands at Redding's Mercy Medical Center, according to the Sacramento Bee. One was later brought to the UC Davis Burn Center in Sacramento for further evaluation.The National Weather Service issued a red flag warning and excessive heat warning for Redding through midnight Friday. Forecasters predicted low humidity, winds up to 25 miles per hour in the area this afternoon and temperatures up to a scorching 111 degrees.Cal Fire's McLean said that although the fire had burned homes in suburban neighborhoods, it is different than the Wine Country fires that devastated neighborhoods in Sonoma and Napa counties last October.Those fires, many of which were started by fallen power lines, were driven by extremely dry conditions and winds of up to 80 m.p.h. that roared in from the north. When the Redding fire exploded out of control Thursday night, the winds were much less strong, but changed directions rapidly, causing havoc.\"This fire has been pushed in every which direction by very erratic winds,\" he said. \"It's caused very erratic fire conditions which is very dangerous.\"Friday at 6:33 a.m., Cal Fire announced the fire grew overnight from 29,000 acres to 44,450 acres, and the containment dropped from 6 to 3 percent.At 1:45 a.m. Friday, Cal Fire issued a mandatory evacuation order for the Shasta Dam Visitor Center, all of Shasta Dam Boulevard and all of Shasta Lake City and Summit City. Evacuation centers were set up at Shasta College and Cross Point Community Church in Redding and Weaverville Elementary School in Weaverville.At 12:15 a.m., several other neighborhoods were issued mandatory evacuation orders.\"We ask everyone to heed evacuation orders and leave promptly,\" Cal Fire Incident Commander Brett Gouvea said in a video released late Thursday night on Twitter. \"This fire is extremely dangerous and moving with no regard for what's in its path.\"Late Thursday, Cal Fire also announced that the private bulldozer contractor was killed while \"working on an active section of the fire.\"\"The fire community is extremely heartbroken by this loss,\" Gouvea said. \"They are dedicated to investigating what what happened and will release more information as it becomes available.\"As we mourn the loss, we also battle a fire that is moving extremely quickly and erratically into western Redding.\"Friday morning, Amtrak announced its service between Seattle and Los Angeles has been \"temporarily disrupted\" between Sacramento and Klamath Falls, Oregon because of the Carr Fire. A northbound train was terminated in Sacramento and a southbound train ended in Klamath Falls with \"no substitute transportation currently available.\"The U.S. Bureau of Land Management reported Friday it has temporarily closed public lands west of Redding because of the Carr Fire. The closures affect lands north of Placer Road and west of Keswick, including the Keswick area, Iron Mountain Road, the Chappie-Shasta Off Highway Vehicle Recreation Area and the Swasey Recreation Area.Firefighters had tried in vain to build containment around the blaze Thursday, but flames kept jumping their lines. Earlier Thursday, with flames exploding around Whiskeytown Lake, an effort to save boats at a marina by untying them from moorings and pushing them to safety wasn't swift enough to spare them all.Dozens of charred, twisted and melted boats were among the losses at Oak Bottom Marina.\"The only buildings left standing ... right now are the fire station and a couple of restrooms,\" said Fire Chief Mike Hebrard of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.\"The boat docks down there -- all the way out in the water -- 30 to 40 boats caught fire when the fire laid down on top of them last night and burned those up.\"In the historic Gold Rush-era town of Shasta, state parks employees worked through the early morning to rescue artifacts from a museum as the blaze advanced.Wildfires throughout the state have burned through tinder-dry brush and forest, forced thousands to evacuate homes and forced campers to pack up their tents at the height of summer.Staff writer Jason Green contributed to this report.___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "622"}

{"content": "It's probably fitting that the U.S.'s first trillion-dollar company makes a product that most people don't leave their home without.  Apple Inc. (AAPL) shares officially broke through the barrier on Thursday late morning when they surged past the $207.04 level before dipping slightly. Based on the company's latest figure of 4.830 billion shares outstanding, that means Apple achieved a market capitalization above $1 trillion. That's '1' followed by 12 zeroes.   But Apple had some competition in the race to hit the trillion-dollar milestone first. Amazon Inc. (AMZN) has a valuation a little north of $870 billion, while Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) boasts a market cap of $848 billion and Microsoft Inc. (MSFT) has seen its stock rebound to an $809 billion valuation.  China's PetroChina briefly soared past a trillion-dollar market capitalization in 2007 when it debuted on the Shanghai stock exchange, but it quickly fell below that vaunted mark subsequently.  Apple's latest impressive quarterly earnings report on Tuesday were behind its recent surge. Apple earned $2.34 per share on revenue of $53.27 billion, versus analyst expectations of $2.18 per share on revenue of $52.34 billion. Shares of Apple are up 22% year to date.  Speaking about Apple's June quarter report, Tim Cook said \"We're thrilled to report Apple's best June quarter ever, and our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth. Our Q3 results were driven by continued strong sales of iPhone, Services and Wearables, and we are very excited about the products and services in our pipeline.\" Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon are holdings in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS member club.

{"content": "(Photo by Tom Pennington/Getty Images)MichiganMichigan football has some really high expectations heading into the season and in order to meet those, here are five questions that must be answered.The 2018 season for Michigan football is about to get started, officially. Aug. 3 is when fall camp opens and that\u2019s when the Wolverines will start the final part of their training for the 2018 season.There is no doubt that Michigan football is among the most talented teams in the country. Just look at the NFL prospects on both sides of the ball. Shea Patterson has all the eyes on him offensively, as he is projected to be UM\u2019s starting quarterback. But he also has a couple of backs and receivers with pro potential as well.Defensively, Michigan is loaded. Rashan Gary might be as good on the defensive line as anyone and Chase Winovich is another really good edge rusher. The pass rush should be fierce, especially if Gary can take another jump in his junior season.Beyond the front four, the defense is filled with NFL-caliber guys like Devin Bush Jr., Khaleke Hudson, Lavert Hill and David Long, just to name a new. Special teams should also be solid with Quinn Nordin kicking and Donovan Peoples-Jones returning, fresh off earning freshmen All-American honors as a return guy.Jim Harbaugh, for the all the flack he has gotten, is 28-11 in three seasons at Michigan. The three years prior, Michigan football posted a record of 20-18 under Brady Hoke. The one thing both three-year spans have in common is zero wins over Ohio State and only one each (two total) over Michigan State.A lot of things need to change and there are some questions that need answering, so here are five questions this Michigan team must answer in 2018.", "id": "625"}

(Photo by Ezra Shaw/Getty Images)Of all the teams in the NFL in 2018, the Redskins might possess the widest range of possibilities.On one end of the spectrum, the Washington Redskins offense has the potential to be electric. Alex Smith is coming off a year in which he was borderline elite at the quarterback position. At almost every other offensive position, there is undeniable upside, which the union of Smith and Jay Gruden can unlock. The defense is as strong as it\u2019s ever been under Gruden. There are no gaping holes on the roster.But on the other side of the coin, there is uncertainty. The Redskins have a lot of moving pieces this year. Pressure will be on younger, more unproven players to compete at important positions; players with natural talent, but no existing track records against NFL competition.A rare stable constant for the 2018 Washington Redskins is Alex Smith, a quarterback who\u2019s done one thing over the course of his career at a consistent rate: Win. Despite his perceived flaws, and against the cries of all his detractors, Alex Smith wins games. It\u2019s strange; in a sport as complex as football, it\u2019s as simple as that for Smith.Want your voice heard? Join the Riggo's Rag team!Now it just begs the question: Will Smith bring his winning ways to Washington? Or will the Redskins be the exception to the rule?The Redskins are one of the NFL\u2019s hardest teams to predict in 2018. They could be competent competitors for the NFC East title, or it could take the pieces another year to mesh. Announcing a prediction, at this point, is still a tall task.

{"content": "Loneliness is a difficult feeling. It can leave you feeling stressed and unhappy. Yet at the same time it\u2019s hard to pinpoint why. This is because loneliness is a very individual experience. It might manifest itself as frustration at others, or feeling misunderstood.When you\u2019re in the midst of loneliness, there are a few helpful things to remember. These will help you stay focused and positive despite the circumstances. It\u2019s not false positivity, either. Claim it for yourself and make it real.     Here are 5 things to remember when you feel lonely:1. This, too, will passOne of the things to remember about loneliness is that it doesn\u2019t last. Recognize that you\u2019ve felt lonely before. But don\u2019t beat yourself up about it! You survived that last period of loneliness. You\u2019ll survive this one, too. It\u2019s been said that \u201cYou can come out bitter or you can come out better. There is purpose in your pain.\u201d This temporary feeling does not define you. Remember these things the next time you\u2019re struggling with loneliness. Mindfulness can be a good exercise here. It involves stilling your mind. Allow your thoughts to come and go instead of hanging on to them. Sometimes you might have to \u201cfake it \u2019till you make it,\u201d but that\u2019s ok, too!2. Take care of yourselfOvercoming loneliness starts from within. Make yourself a priority. Low self-esteem directly contributes to loneliness. Reverse the process! Part of recovering from low self-esteem is becoming your own best friend. This looks different for everyone. It involves surrounding yourself with whatever makes you happy.     Be gentle with yourself while you\u2019re trying to remember these things. It\u2019s important to acknowledge your feelings without judgement. Lonely people stay lonely when they try to ignore what they\u2019re feeling. Or, worse yet, they keep dwelling on the past. They believe that old habits are things to remember instead of let go of.3. Seek out positive and supportive relationshipsLoneliness can be physical as well as mental. A key sign of loneliness is a feeling of disconnection from those around you. Lonely people also have an unfortunate tendency to self-isolate.Instead, consciously reach out when you find yourself slipping. Good friends will help you come up with better things to remember. People love to be thought of! Sometimes all it takes is making that first step. Making that connection is a relief and a tangible reminder that loneliness can\u2019t control you. Besides, loved ones can remind you of happier times. They\u2019re great for taking your mind off whatever is bringing you down.     4. Reassess your prioritiesYou might also feel lonely because you\u2019ve been focused on work and other projects instead of loved ones. Take a break! Decide what\u2019s truly important to you. Of course, when it comes to your to-do list, you should remember these things. But try rewriting that list. What do you want to accomplish today? Pick something you\u2019ve always wanted to do. It could be an art piece or learning a new language. That will also give you an excellent sense of accomplishment. It brings you out of your shell. Think of what your \u201cwhy\u201d is. Redefining your purpose helps increase your value to others, too.5. You are importantFeeling valuable and loved can be among the hardest things to remember when you\u2019re lonely. There\u2019s the temptation to feel justified in your loneliness. Start believing that you\u2019re better than that. Make a point of looking out for positive signs instead. That might seem easier said than done, but everything starts with baby steps.One step could be to start keeping a gratitude list. Write down good things people did for you. Write down good things you did for others. A list of this kind illustrates that you are worthy of love. It rejects the assumption that you are doomed to feel lonely. You don\u2019t need to be surrounded by people all the time to feel important. Don\u2019t define your self-worth by what others think of you.Understand that loneliness will happen. That\u2019s why you should prepare for it instead of being afraid or feeling weak because you\u2019re going through this. We are all lonely at one point or another. It\u2019s how you handle loneliness that really counts.", "id": "629"}
{"content": "\u201cA few fans, a few light bulbs, you can\u2019t turn on your AC, so you\u2019re sweating like an animal, just dripping.\u201d It\u2019s not what Maria Grubb had in mind five years ago when she and her brother opened Gallo Negro, an upscale restaurant in San Juan, Puerto Rico. But that was before Hurricane Maria, before the farms she sourced from were destroyed, before her employees left the island.         \u201cThere\u2019s no power, there\u2019s no roads, everything\u2019s flooded,\u201d Grubb recalls. \u201cMold covered everything, grease everywhere. We had to take everything out, repaint, redo the roofs.\u201d Still, Grubb counts herself lucky to have reopened at all, when many of her friends were forced to close their doors for good. She had a small generator, and used it to power a few light bulbs, and a weak fan she pointed toward her kitchen. Before the hurricane, Grubb was known for her modern cuisine, dishes she learned to make while training in New York restaurants. And this week, she returned to the city in hopes of spreading the word about her restaurant, and Puerto Rico.         In reality, Grubb never had plans to cook professionally. Growing up, Grubb helped at her parents\u2019 hot-dog cart, and remembers their seemingly endless shifts at the restaurants where they worked. Food was a central part of Grubb\u2019s life, but it was as much a chore as anything else. By the time she was 8, Grubb was helping her mother in the kitchen even though she couldn\u2019t reach the stove. \u201cShe made me cook rice and beans,\u201d says Grubb. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have that normal childhood of like, \u2018Can we go to the movies after school?\u2019 \u2018Cause we had to go home and help cook.\u201d                          But when she and her husband moved to New York in 2002, with her sights set on attending law school, cooking didn\u2019t feel like a chore. \u201cI just discovered so many amazing things here, like my first experience with truffles, all these things that really got me into cooking.\u201d At first, she was content to shop at her local markets, and cook elaborate meals at home. But the longer she was in New York, the more she wanted to cook professionally. So Grubb, who was 26 at the time, put her plans for law school aside, and enrolled at the International Culinary Center. She had a newborn son, and juggled culinary school and a job cooking at the currently closed French restaurant Pastis. After Grubb graduated with honors, she spent ten years working the line at New York\u2019s fine-dining restaurants. She learned the names of every spice and vegetable at the Modern when she cooked there with Gabriel Kreuther, and was part of Danny Meyer\u2019s opening team at Maialino.                                           She loved the 14-hour shifts, and learning about Korean, Vietnamese, and Mexican food from the other cooks at family meal, and never tired of mastering new techniques. But she had a 12-year-old son with nonverbal autism at home, and the crazy shifts and sleepless nights were becoming too much. \u201cMy husband is very supportive, but we had no other family to help us, and my son requires a lot of attention,\u201d Grubb says. Her parents still lived on the island, and her brother was talking about transforming the cafeteria he ran into a fancy restaurant. Only, he couldn\u2019t cook.         So Grubb moved her family back to Puerto Rico, and took up the position of head chef at her brother\u2019s restaurant. From the beginning, Gallo Negro was a huge hit. It also filled what Grubb says was a gap in diversity when it came to dining on the island. \u201cThere\u2019s no Vietnamese, there\u2019s no Korean, there\u2019s no Moroccan, there\u2019s no Ethiopian,\u201d Grubb noticed. There was little she didn\u2019t already know how to cook, and her menus were full of inspiration and technique she\u2019d learned in New York, both on the line and from fellow cooks during family meals. Young Puerto Ricans and tourists filled her dining room, and she was able to hire more cooks and waitstaff.                          Then the hurricane hit: \u201cThe restaurant was a disaster,\u201d she recalls. \u201cA third of the island was still without power, and farmers were struggling to rebuild. Not a single one of Grubb\u2019s waitstaff or cooks showed up for work on their first day reopening in January; they\u2019d all left the island since the hurricane. A third of the island was still without power, and farmers were struggling to rebuild.         Before the hurricane hit, Grubb was known for her goat, rabbit, and fish dishes. After, however, all the local farms were destroyed, and their stands were shuttered. \u201cThe only thing that we had was Costco. It became a 100 percent Costco menu.\u201d                          She found ground beef, tomatoes, spaghetti, pita, olives, and chicken. Her new menu consisted of Bolognese, \u201cGreek nachos\u201d (made with pita instead of corn chips, topped with Feta, olives, and red onions), chicken Parmesan, and a Brussels-sprouts Caesar salad. \u201cI immediately just went to comfort food. That was the menu I could put forward with no staff.\u201d It was how her parents cooked when Grubb was growing up, and she no longer had the capacity to produce her technical, modern French and Italian dishes. She\u2019d haul her day\u2019s groceries back from Costco, and prepare them alone in the swelteringly hot kitchen. \u201cYou can\u2019t turn on your hood, or your AC or anything. I didn\u2019t expect to be cooking with just a few light bulbs and a fan blowing into my face.", "id": "630"}

Among the 14 taps are Maplewood's core beers -- Charlatan pale ale, Son of Juice IPA, Pulaski Pils pilsner and Fat Pug nitrogenated oatmeal milk stout -- plus seasonal releases and one-off beers. 2717 N. Maplewood Ave., 773-270-1061, maplewoodbrew.com.The Mousetrap (Off Color Brewing taproom)Mousetrap -- a reference to the little critter on Off Color Brewing's logo -- opened in November as the beermaker's second brewery, this one with a taproom. It will focus on experimental beers, including anything made with wild yeast. It features the typical brick walls and a handsome, sturdy concrete bar top, but also more unusual elements like eucalyptus wood floors, warm globe lights and tabletops made from wood harvested from the 110-year-old former brick rail station. 1460 N. Kingsbury St., offcolorbrewing.com.Goose Island BrewhouseThe transformation of worn and cozy Goose Island brewpub into sleek and tidy Goose Island Brewhouse is a lesson in letting go of the past. The old pub, launched in 1988, was revolutionary when it opened. It taught a generation or two not just to love beer, but to understand beer. But the brewpub became a dark and cluttered relic from another era. Enter Goose Island Brewhouse, the product of a 10-month renovation that opened and lightened the space. The bar has 28 taps pouring beer from production breweries and the gleaming new 15-barrel brewing system in the next room. 1800 N. Clybourn Ave., 312-915-0071, gooseisland.com.Half Acre Beer Co. Balmoral TaproomThe new Half Acre taproom sits a mere 1.6 miles north of the other Half Acre taproom, which opened five years ago. It's rare for a brewery to operate two taprooms so close together. But Half Acre approached the undertaking as a challenge: Create a wholly different experience that is clearly, uniquely Half Acre. They pulled it off. The new Balmoral Avenue taproom has a similar quirky vibe flush with natural materials -- handsome woodwork, especially. But it features a decidedly different menu, a sleeker ambience and more draft lines -- 20, where Lincoln has 14. 2050 W.

{"content": "July 27--On the southwest corner of Logan Square's Haas Park playground, next to a state-of-the-art soccer field where kids in cleats run daytime scrimmages and families spread blankets for nighttime movies, a tiny, beautiful garden has taken root.It bears the name of a girl who used to play there, back when there was no soccer field. Back when a baseball diamond took up most of the play space and home plate sat in that same southwest corner, the one where purple coneflowers and blue lupine plants now grow.\"Sofia Khan Garden,\" reads a little blue sign -- unassuming in stature, extraordinary in purpose.\"It has Sofia's name on it,\" said Sheri Khan, Sofia's mom, \"but I want it to be for everyone.\"Sofia died in 2010 when she was 9 years old. Her family was on vacation near Holland, Wis., when Sofia drowned in Lake Michigan during a kayaking accident.\"I lived in a bubble where horrible things happened to other people and not me,\" Khan told me. \"I lived that way for a very long time, until something happened to my family that really shook my worldview. It shook everything. It shook my foundation. It shook my faith. It shook my everything.\"Friends told her she'd be OK; her family would be OK. She wasn't sure she believed them. But she made a choice, she said, to try.\"It's an intentional choice,\" she said. \"Every day. Every day I choose to believe we're going to be OK. My kids are going to be OK. My family's going to be OK.\"She wants Sofia's garden to help others make that same choice.\"Holding onto that hope that you can heal is huge,\" she said. \"And the worst mistake we can make is to think we're alone. The moment we start thinking that, it makes it even harder to make that choice to heal.\"Haas Park was Sofia's second home. She and her two older brothers, Noah and Zane, would walk outside, cross the alley and run through the dirt to the old playground. Sofia attended the summer camp. She played on the softball team.\"She was like a bubbling fountain,\" said Joe Henry, longtime Haas Park supervisor. \"Just such a joy and pleasure to be around. She'd be out there playing football with the boys, soccer, you name it.\"Henry pushed to have the playground named after Sofia, but bureaucratic red tape kept stalling that endeavor.\"We just wanted something that would fit the personality of our little friend,\" Henry said. \"Something to add to her memory and her legacy.\"Bridget Montgomery, a neighbor whose son used to play with Sofia at the park, had the idea for a garden. She launched a GoFundMe page to raise money for plants and a bench, maybe a few boulders, a sign.She raised a little more than $3,000 and, along with Henry, attended Haas Park advisory council meetings for years to advocate for the garden.On June 30, it finally came to be. The park hosted a small dedication ceremony.\"We want to make it a little sanctuary,\" Montgomery, a Chicago Pubic Schools counselor, said. \"I want people to be able to go there and be peaceful and reflective.\"She wants people to know who Sofia was.\"A whole crop of new folks have moved to Logan Square who don't even know the Khans,\" Montgomery said. \"I want to keep adding to the garden and expanding the garden, so people know Sofia and know the garden's purpose.\"Sofia's body was never recovered from Lake Michigan. The U.S. Coast Guard searched for her. Four separate dive teams searched for her. All to no avail.\"We don't have a gravesite,\" Khan said. \"When I see her name on something, that's very important to me. She has a plaque at St. Helen, where she went to school. I get to see her name on a brick wall, and that's important. I think that's why something like this garden means so much to our family.\"Noah is 21 now. Zane is 18. Khan and her husband, Omer, had another daughter in 2012. Emaan, which means faith, is now 6. She attends day camp at Haas.\"Emaan knows the park is special,\" Khan said. \"She knows there's a special place for all of us here.\"On Sept. 9, Khan is planning to host a remembrance ceremony at the garden.\"For anyone who's lost anyone,\" she said. \"We'll have river rocks that you can paint your loved one's name on, and we'll place them in the garden. It's a community. It's important for people to know they're not the only ones going through something hard.\"A few years after Sofia died, when Khan learned to make room for sorrow, but also glimpses of joy, as part of her daily routine, she enrolled at DePaul University to earn a master's degree in education with a focus on mental health. She wants to better understand her own grief and help others through theirs.She graduated on the eighth anniversary of Sofia's death. She carried Sofia's picture.\"I'm called to help people when they go through something like this,\" she said. \"I had no clue what to expect. I had no clue how to help myself. I'm called to provide people hope in whatever form that looks like. To ignore that calling would be the death of my soul.\"The garden helps. And it hurts.\"It's bittersweet,\" she said. \"It's still very difficult to see her name like that.\"She paused.\"But it's very kind,\" she said. \"The fact that they've done this and they continue to welcome us in. I can never find the words to say enough gratitude. I don't feel like we have the words in our language to express deep gratitude for people's kindness.\"Sofia loved dirt.\"Dirt, dirt, dirt,\" Khan said. \"She was always digging and playing. She was very spirited. She was just the light of our worlds, for sure.\"It's meaningful, I think, that hope and growth would take root in her name.\"If my story, my family's story, Sofia's story can help even one person, I have to share it,\" Khan said. \"I have to do that in her honor.\"hstevens@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "632"}
{"content": "July 29--One thing Blackhawks President John McDonough has made clear since taking over the franchise 11 years ago is that he isn't interested in modest success on the ice, the goal is to win Stanley Cups.The Hawks have won three Cups during his tenure, so this never has been idle chatter, and with several core pieces still around there's no indication anything resembling a full rebuild is on the horizon. Talk of the championship window being closed is for other franchises.But take a look around the elegant ballrooms of the Chicago Hilton, where the Blackhawks have been conducting their annual convention this weekend, and here's what you don't see: windows.How's that for a metaphor.The Hawks have demonstrated the kind of sustained success about which most professional sports franchises only can dream. The organization, once infamously dubbed the worst franchise in sports, underwent a complete resurrection over the last decade.A team that was once not even an afterthought became synonymous with success. But nothing lasts forever.Patrick Sharp is retired, Marian Hossa is done playing and the other core pieces of the three Stanley Cup championships are all older than 30, save for Patrick Kane, who reaches that milestone in November. And they're coming off a last-place finish.So the question must be asked: Is the Hawks' championship window still open?\"Absolutely,\" Blackhawks coach Joel Quenneville said. \"As a staff, as a team, as individual players that's what drives us in this business: You think that you can win. We all saw a team last year, probably not a person in the world would have thought Vegas had a real legitimate chance of being a champion. Colorado, non-playoff team last in the league, all of a sudden makes the playoffs and anything can happen.\"Quenneville, who turns 60 in September, has two years left on his contract. He has been a head coach in the NHL for 22 seasons and last year was the first time one of his teams didn't finish above .500.\"We all should accept some of the responsibility of improving,\" he said. \"Individually, we need our top guys to be as good as they ever have been.\"But can they?Jonathan Toews, 30, needs to be much better than last season when, statistically, he had the worst season of his career. Duncan Keith, 35, didn't receive any votes in the Norris Trophy voting for the first time since the 2006-07 season.Corey Crawford's health will be a concern until he proves he can get back on the ice after suffering a season-ending injury in December. Perhaps the biggest issue going forward is what to do with Brent Seabrook, who is only 33 but isn't anywhere near the player he was at his peak and still has six years left on his contract with a $6.875 million annual cap hit.Kane has no doubt the Hawks still can contend for championships over the next few years, including this season.\"I don't see why not,\" Kane said. \"You can talk about age and different things but a lot of us probably will tell you we felt as good as we ever had, whether it's from what has happened the last few seasons with not having really deep playoff runs and just the knowledge you gain as you get older. And being mature and how to take care of yourself and get yourself as best as possible.\"If the window isn't closed, it's closing. But as long as it's open even a little bit, these players who have won so much will believe another Stanley Cup run is possible.jgreenfield@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "633"}
{"content": "The Baltimore Ravens defense was pretty good in 2018, but there were some key breakdowns along the way. Here are five reasons the Ravens defense will be better in 2018:5. A Deeper Secondary:The Jimmy Smith injury has shattered the Baltimore Ravens ability to play defense against top-tier teams. It seems to happen almost every season. Smith is considered an elite cornerback when he is on the field, and when is the keyword there. The Ravens walk into 2018 with Smith being an important member of the defense. When he\u2019s available, the opponent\u2019s best receiver is going to get slowed down dramatically. The Ravens have a deeper overall secondary though.In addition to a lot of quality players at their disposal the Ravens have star power at the cornerback position. Marlon Humphrey emerged as one of the league\u2019s most talented cornerbacks and in 2018 he has a chance to play at an elite level. Brandon Carr, Tavon Young, Maurice Cannady, and Anthony Averett make a good core group at the position. The backup plan for the Ravens is simple. Humphrey becomes the number one cornerback, while the rest of the gang vies for a chance at the number two spot. While Humphrey is the only elite player not named Smith, we know that Young can play and we know what to expect from Carr. The Ravens actually have a viable plan B, which is something we couldn\u2019t say for the longest time.The Ravens could use a lot of sub packages. Let\u2019s face it, there will be moments where having extra defensive backs will be a huge advantage. The Ravens defense will have a lot of speed on the field at all times. One component of this secondary is most of the players can tackle. Tony Jefferson is a strong safety who is an extension of the linebacker group, Eric Weddle isn\u2019t afraid to lay down a hit. Humphrey and Smith are physical players. The secondary is the strength of the team coming into the season. It will be even better than it was last year, and Baltimore led the league in interceptions, with 22.", "id": "634"}
{"content": "There has been a lot of talk about the Washington Redskins picking either Samaje Perine or Rob Kelley for their 53-man roster. Realistically, that shouldn\u2019t even be a conversation.As of the moment, it doesn\u2019t seem like both Samaje Perine and Rob Kelley will make the final roster. The Redskins, and Jay Gruden, in particular, seem content to keep four running backs this offseason. As of right now, two are locks: Derrius Guice and Chris Thompson.At the beginning of the offseason, it seemed possible that both Perine and Kelley could make the roster, but the Redskins are likely to keep a true backup to Thompson this year. The receiving backs Byron Marshall, Kapri Bibbs, and Martez Carter are all fighting for that role, and it appears that Marshall has the upper hand right now. So, with one of those players likely to occupy the fourth running back role, Perine and Kelley will duke it out for the No. 3 job.However, if that ends up being the competition, the choice should be easy for the Redskins. Perine should be the choice over Kelley barring a massive change during training camp.As a rookie, Perine had some solid showings. The fourth-round pick earned the starting role halfway through the 2017 season after Kelley suffered an injury. Perine fared well in his first couple of starts before tapering off down the stretch. All told, he had back-to-back 100-yard games and appeared to have the makings of a good power/short yardage back in the NFL.For those pointing at Perine\u2019s lackluster stat line (175 carries, 603 yards, 3.4 yards per carry, and one touchdown) that is a sensible argument. However, it has to be noted that the line Perine was running behind was far from full strength, as the Redskins were decimated by injuries by the time he got on the field. That definitely cost him some potential yardage, and it stands to reason that he would improve with better blocking.It\u2019s also worth noting that Perine is three years younger than Kelley, and that factor can\u2019t be underestimated given the short shelf life of running backs, especially the very physical ones.As for Kelley, there\u2019s no doubting that he can be a quality backup option. In his first year with the Redskins as an undrafted free agent, he ran for 704 yards and six scores and always was able to gain a few yards on every carry.However, he regressed badly in his second season, dealing with numerous injuries and averaging 3.1 yards per carry. Even worse, in his final five games, he only totaled 86 yards on 40 carries (2.15 yards per carry). And when he was on the field, he looked sluggish and lacked explosive ability. Perine isn\u2019t particularly explosive either, but his vision is better than Kelley\u2019s and he will have a chance to improve with another year in the NFL.Kelley and Perine aren\u2019t too different from each other. I\u2019ll admit that. But even if all things were equal, Perine is younger and has more upside than Kelley. That\u2019s not to say that Kelley can\u2019t be a good backup on an NFL team, but Perine is just a better fit right now. Perine should earn the backup role for the Redskins and unless Kelley vastly outperforms him in the preseason, nothing will change that.", "id": "635"}

The stupid viral challenges are very dangerous, and the Hot Water Challenge follows the same vein.The Hot Water Challenge ExplainedIn the Hot Water Challenge, participants either drink boiling water through a straw, or pour the boiling water on a friend. The activity sounds dangerous, mostly because it really is. In fact, a child already died last year after drinking boiling water as part of the Hot Water Challenge.According to doctors, they are seeing more patients being taken to emergency rooms due to viral internet challenges. Unfortunately, for a teen from Indiana, he turned out to be one of them.Teen Burned By Hot Water ChallengeKyland Clark, a 15-year-old from Indianapolis, looked up the Hot Water Challenge on YouTube. Clark's friend then decided to prank him, and poured hot water on him while he was sleeping. Whatever his friend expected would happen after pouring hot water on him, it was likely not what transpired.\"My skin just fell off my chest, and then I looked in the mirror and I had skin falling off here and, on my face,\" Clark said.Clark became the latest Hot Water Challenge victim, with second-degree burns on his chest, back, and face. He was confined in the hospital for a week as he received treatment.\"To see my baby, all burned up like that, it was heartbreaking,\" said Andrea, the teen's mother. Clark and his mom are now looking to warn other families on the dangers of the Hot Water Challenge.The Hot Water Challenge is actually not new, as it has been circulating on video-sharing websites and social media since as early as 2013 or 2014. However, it appears that teens have not learned about the dangers of the activity.\"It's suggesting to people that they can try it and they won't be hurt, but they will be. I can guarantee it,\" said Dr. Ed Bartkus, Clarian Methodist Hospital EMS director.According to Barktus, teens who do the Hot Water challenge may end up with permanent disfigurement, due to the burns on their bodies, or even death, if the boiling water burns to their airways.", "id": "636"}

{"content": "July 28--Spearmint Rhino, a bikini bar that bills itself as a \"gentlemen's club,\" opened for business in downtown San Jose on Thursday night. If this sounds familiar, that's because a similar operation called the Gold Club opened five years ago in the same historic West Santa Clara Street building, stirring up some controversy.The club occupies the San Jose Building and Loan Association building, a Beaux Arts edifice built in 1927, making it one of downtown's oldest buildings and a city landmark. Over the past decade-plus, it's housed a number of lounges. For those who remember the old building, its gorgeous stained-glass skylight has survived. It's merely been draped in somewhat see-through fabric, much like everything else at Spearmint Rhino.The dimly-lit interior of the two-level club is decorated with leopard print carpeting and wood-grain paneling on the walls, which are decorated with ornately framed photographs of barely dressed women. Of course, there's a stage with a dance pole off to the side of the lower level, where bikini-clad dancers perform for customers. While Spearmint Rhino operates nude clubs in other areas, all-nude establishments are not allowed in San Jose. (The famous Pink Poodle, Santa Clara County's most well-known strip club, gets around this because it's in Burbank, an unincorporated pocket surrounded by San Jose.)Notably, there wasn't a ribbon-cutting to do Thursday with the the chamber of commerce's big scissors and members of the City Council lining up to talk about the activation of a vacant space. The opening did attract a crowd of downtown workers, bartenders and nightlife industtry veterans including longtime downtown club operator Jenny Wolfes, who runs the Studio 8 nightclub in the Bank of Italy building and FUZ Bar &amp; Grill in the old Bella Mia restaurant space on South First Street.Club management wouldn't comment for the record, but sentiments expressed by some at the opening echoed comments by George Mull, spokesman for the operators of the Gold Club and Spearmint Rhino, from 2013.\"San Jose is the 10th-largest city in the United States,\" he said to this news organization when the Gold Club opened. \"I would think the city would be mature enough to handle a bikini bar.\"___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "638"}

Sooner or later, it seems like one team in need of help at receiver is going to decide to take a chance on Bryant, and based off a report from Ian Rapoport from Friday, it looks like there may be some interest from the Cleveland Browns.Only time will tell whether or not an actual meeting takes place between the too parties, but from Bryant\u2019s perspective, he may not have that much of a choice since the start of preseason is right around the corner with training camp already underway.

{"content": "July 30--Midway Airport has unveiled a new food court, the most prominent change for travelers since a massive $75 million concession redevelopment began more than a year ago.The 6,300-square-foot space in Concourse A was previously unused. New restaurants include Arami, a branch of the West Town sushi restaurant owned by Michelin-starred chef Ty Fujimura; Woodgrain Neapolitan Pizzeria, a wood-fired pizza chain with three locations in the western suburbs; and Chicago stalwart Billy Goat Tavern.The restaurants are among the first permanent additions to Midway in almost 20 years, but the construction that started last May came with a huge outcry from travelers over what they were losing. Among the restaurants that closed and will not return to Midway were McDonald's and Potbelly. McDonald's declined at the time of its closure last year to give sales figures, but Potbelly said the Midway Airport location was its busiest.Erin O'Donnell, Midway's managing deputy commissioner, said the airport authority responded to many comments and complaints from the flying public as construction got underway, but she added that she believes the pushback from Potbelly and McDonald's loyalists is being quelled as the airport unveils a greater variety and an increased number of local options.The food court also includes a Nuts on Clark and a new sit-down location for Oak Lawn's Irish pub Reilly's Daughter, which replaced the Schaller's Pump that was originally planned in the development. The storied Bridgeport watering hole closed last year after 136 years in business.The new food court is part of a broader plan to overhaul concessions at the airport through a construction and renovation project expected to last through 2020. The changes are already increasing sales. The average traveler's spending is up 9.5 percent since construction began, and overall sales have increased by 9 percent to $112.9 million, according to the new concession manager, Midway Partnership LLC, a joint venture of three companies picked through a modified bidding process.Two other Chicago restaurants with multiple city locations, Big &amp; Little's and Porkchop, opened at the airport in May. Grab-and-go sandwich chain Camden Food also opened a permanent location.The next changes that travelers will see will be the closure of restaurants along the concourses, a few at a time, and their subsequent replacement with new vendors. That process will take until the end of next year, O'Donnell said.Big Shoulders Coffee and Einstein Bros. Bagels are set to open this winter. Home Run Inn and Harry Caray's 7th Inning Stretch -- which had been temporarily removed when construction began last year -- will also begin building new locations at Midway this year.After that, the \"Central Market\" food court -- the main collection of food options that's just past security -- will be tackled. That renovation will take until the end of 2020.When the renovations are complete, the space for concessions will have increased by 75 percent and a total of 70 new brands will have been installed. The number of permanent concession jobs is also expected to double at the airport, to 1,400, by 2020.sbomkamp@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "640"}
{"content": "July 28--John and Mei-lian Lin were having dinner and watching the news when the story broke that investigators had used a public genealogy database to help find the 72-year-old man they believe is the Golden State Killer, cracking one of California's most notorious cold cases in decades.John Lin dropped his fork. Then he picked up the phone.With a direct line to Alameda County Sheriff's Det. Patrick Smyth, he asked if the same novel technique could help solve the murder of his 14-year-old daughter, Jenny. In 1994, she was stabbed to death in their Castro Valley home.\"It really boosted our hope that the sheriff could do the same thing and scale up the investigation of Jenny's case and hopefully we could get a break soon,\" said Lin, who is 69 and retired and living with his wife in Los Angeles.The Lins had reason to be optimistic.In just over 10 weeks since Joseph DeAngelo was arrested on suspicion of a dozen murders and 45 rapes up and down the state during the 1970s and '80s, law enforcement across the country has rushed to take advantage of the technology that links genetic profiles from crime scene DNA with family trees on a public genealogy website. Their success has been astounding.At least five cold cases, each of which had stymied investigators for at least 25 years, have been solved using the new approach. In June, a 49-year-old disc jockey in Pennsylvania was blindsided when he was arrested for the 1992 murder of a Lancaster school teacher. In May, a truck driver in Washington state was apprehended for the 1987 slaying of a young couple -- the woman was raped and man was strangled. And two weeks ago, a 59-year-old loner in Fort Wayne, Indiana, was nabbed for the 1988 rape and murder of an 8-year-old girl. He immediately confessed.Law enforcement's quick success using the public genealogy database -- originally created for people seeking distant relatives and building family trees -- is ushering in a golden era for crime solving. Because none of the suspects' DNA was already in law enforcement databases, there had been no easy way to test them against samples found at the crime scenes.\"We're at a watershed moment,\" said Steve Armentrout, CEO and founder of Parabon NanoLabs, a Virginia company to which law enforcement agencies are sending their DNA samples, hoping for a match. \"Cases are being solved at an unprecedented rate.\"Over the next year, he said, he wouldn't be surprised if the technique helps solve at least 100 more cold cases.Genetic genealogy isn't just for old cases with no suspects. On Friday in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, police announced they used the database to solve the 2016 stabbing death of an 81-year-old woman after matching DNA from the crime scene with the mother of one of the two suspects.In the Bay Area, San Mateo County is reviewing two cases, determining whether enough DNA remains from crimes scenes to be good candidates. The Santa Clara County District Attorney's Office is looking at five cold cases -- a few of which already have been sent to Parabon to run through the public database. It won't say which cases.\"We are using the same technique, and we are using it because we wish to exhaust every method and effort we can to identify and prosecute killers,\" said Matt Braker, Santa Clara County's deputy district attorney in charge of the cold case unit.Investigators aren't counting on the suspected killers themselves to have uploaded their genetic profiles to the genealogy website. But, like in the case of the Golden State Killer, they're hoping to find a distant relative's DNA to help lead to a perpetrator who's lived under the radar for decades.Although law enforcement agencies are reluctant to discuss specifics, some are hoping the new approach can help finally track down two of the area's most notorious cases: the Zodiac Killer and the NorCal rapist.San Francisco Police say that for now, they are not using the technique. But in Vallejo, where the Zodiac killer also claimed victims in the late 1960s, police have sent envelopes of the Zodiac's DNA -- from licked stamps he put on taunting letters to police and newspapers -- to a private lab for review. In Contra Costa County, where former forensics chief Paul Holes pioneered the technique to track down the Golden State Killer, officials at the district attorney's office are unaware of other cold cases using the same approach.But what about Alameda County, where Jenny Lin was killed?Authorities there say that while the Jenny Lin case continues to be a top priority, they are hesitant to use the genealogy database, citing issues raised by the ACLU and other groups that mining \"deeply private and sensitive\" genetic codes violates privacy rights of the perpetrators as well as innocent, distant relatives.\"There's a lot of uncharted waters, legal, moral issues that have been brought up in regards to this. There are some naysayers saying doing this is too intrusive. So we don't know where this is headed,\" said Alameda County Sheriff's Sgt. Ray Kelly. \"We're not saying we would never do it, but we would do it with a court order or search warrant.\"It's the last thing the Lins want to hear.\"That certainly makes me wonder if they are too conservative and overly protective of certain parts of the investigation,\" said John Lin, who has gone through three different detectives assigned in the 24 years since his daughter's murder. \"From the victim's family's point of view, I would certainly prefer they could take a more aggressive approach to help us solve Jenny's case.\"They've waited so long. In 1994, the Friday before Memorial Day weekend, he came home from work just before 7 p.m. to find his teenage daughter stabbed to death in the bathroom.\"Immediately I came into a nightmare, an endless nightmare,\" he said. \"I still feel like I'm in a bad dream and can't wake up.\"He hasn't given up. The Jenny Lin Foundation is active, the $100,000 reward for information still available. The family holds regular vigils and, on Friday, traveled from their home in Los Angeles to co-host a youth music concert at Chabot College in her memory.\"Until this case is solved, there's no peace,\" John Lin said. \"I promised my daughter Jenny I would solve this case before I will take a rest.\"Not all cases are good candidates for using this \"genetic genealogy\" approach. The DNA must be of enough quantity and quality to get a strong genetic code. Lack of strong DNA has been a chronic problem in solving the Zodiac killer case, in particular. Saliva from the stamps he licked in sending taunting letters to law enforcement and newspapers is weak, investigators have said.Genetic profiles that are now being accessed by law enforcement come from public, open-source genealogy databases such as GEDmatch. They usually start with a \"spit kit\" people submit to \"recreational genomics companies\" such as Ancestry.com and 23andMe, with hopes of matching their DNA with distant relatives. Those companies are off-limits to law enforcement without court orders. But customers are allowed to take their own genetic profiles produced from those companies and are uploading them to GEDmatch, hoping that other relatives might find them.\"We're just using those people who said, here I am, please search,\" said Holes, the former Contra Costa County forensics chief who helped a statewide team track down the Golden State Killer.A hit on the database to a third cousin of DeAngelo's was only the first step, however. Holes used that discovery to search the cousin's family tree for relatives who were a closer match to the killer's profile. Then investigators had to conduct some good old-fashioned police work. With evidence from crimes scenes and witnesses, they knew they were looking for someone who was likely in his late 60s or early 70s, who had lived in different parts of the state during certain years and -- in the Golden State Killer's case, in particular -- someone who was involved with a woman named \"Bonnie\" in his past. He had yelled out her name to some of his victims. DeAngelo, who lived outside Sacramento, had once been engaged to a woman named Bonnie.Investigators secretly followed him for days. When he discarded something smeared with his DNA -- police wouldn't say what -- they matched it to DNA from one of the crime scenes.Holes retired just days before the arrest but still has been inundated with calls from law enforcement agencies across the country asking for advice to pursue the same tactic.It isn't foolproof.\"We don't want to lead families of other homicide victims to think this is a magical technique that will solve every case. It is not,\" said Brett Hambright, a spokesman for the Lancaster, Pennsylvania, district attorney's office, which used the technique to arrest Raymond Rowe in the 25-year-old cold case murder of school teacher Christy Mirack. \"And we were up front with the Mirack family about that when we started this process. There are certainly no guarantees.\"Lancaster police had exhausted all leads. The evidence included semen, but it didn't match any DNA in the federal database of known criminals. But when Parabon ran the sample through the GEDmatch database, investigators were stunned. The results pointed to a local DJ, who lived four miles from Mirack's home at the time but had never been known to police.Investigators staked out the DJ during a gig at an elementary school and obtained a \"surreptitious sample\" of his DNA -- chewing gum and a water bottle he had tossed. That DNA matched the semen sample from the crime scene. Rowe was promptly arrested.With 160 DNA samples from law enforcement agencies across the country, Parabon is now working on 50 cases. Not every sample matches someone in the million-sample strong GEDmatch database -- its hit rate is about 50 percent. But when matches are made, Parabon has either identified the killer or gotten as close as a brother or son, Armentrout said. Local law enforcement, using traditional investigative techniques, does the rest.Like the Lins, families of other cold case victims are pressuring law enforcement to try genetic genealogy on their cases. About a half dozen families have contacted the Santa Clara County district attorney's office in recent weeks.Braker, in charge of the cold case unit there, said that while he has considered the privacy issues that are holding up Alameda County, \"those things are going to work their way through the legal system,\" he said. \"To me, weighing the balance and finding the killer, I think we should exert these efforts.\"With so much time passed, however, some victims' family members are weary about digging up the trauma. Robert Stitt said he was told by Sunnyvale police years ago that they had \"blood drop\" from his daughter's killer. In 1982, Karen Stitt, a Palo Alto High student, was found near a Sunnyvale bus stop naked and bound and stabbed 60 times. Whether there is enough DNA to provide a potential match in her case is unclear.Unlike the Lin family, Stitt has mixed feelings about any renewed push to find the killer. He still lives in Palo Alto, but he is 77 now and disabled by a heart condition.\"The whole thing is so painful for me,\" he said in a recent phone interview. \"I don't know whether I can handle a lot of attention being paid to this. I'm not sure I could handle a trial.\"He hasn't heard from law enforcement in about a decade.For John Lin, however, no matter how he might try, he can't stop thinking about his daughter's murder.\"When we wake up in the morning, the first thing we think about is Jenny's case,\" he said, \"and it's the last thing we think about when we go to bed.\"By keeping Jenny's story in the limelight -- like hosting Friday's concert in her memory -- he's still hoping that old-fashioned investigation techniques will come through. Maybe a witness will remember something, or an acquaintance of the killer will come forward.\"We want the public to know,\" he said, \"that until Jenny's case is solved, there's still that monster out there.\"------Cold Cases solved since Golden State KillerJuly 15: John D. Miller, 59, was arrested in Fort Wayne, Indiana, for the 1988 rape and murder of 8-year-old April Tinsley. DNA from the scene and on taunting letters the suspect sent police generated a list of relatives within eight hours of searching the database, leading police to Miller and his brother. Police retrieved DNA from Miller's trash to tie him to the crime scene. Police say he confessed, but has pleaded not guilty.June 25: Raymond Rowe, a 49-year-old disc jockey, was arrested in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, for the 1992 murder of 25-year-old school teacher Christy Mirack. Using DNA left on a carpet sample, police say the database traced the DNA back to Rowe. Retrieving chewing gum and a water bottle he discarded at a DJ gig, police say his DNA matched that from the crime scene. He hasn't entered a plea.June 25: James Otto Earhart -- who was executed in Texas in 1999 for the murder of a 9-year-old girl -- was named as the likely killer of real estate agent Virginia Freeman in Brazos County. Although a convict, Earhart reportedly refused to submit his DNA to the national criminal database. DNA from under Freeman's fingernails, however, was traced back to Earhart, through his second cousins and third cousins once removed. DNA provided by Earhart's son was positive, and Earhart's body was recently exhumed in an effort to confirm the match.June 20: Gary Hartman, 66, was arrested for the 1986 rape and murder of 12-year-old Michella Welch near her Tacoma, Washington, home. A database search traced the suspect's DNA from semen to a family tree of Native American great-great grandparents, which led investigators to two brothers who were about the right age of the suspect and lived nearby at the time. With DNA from a discarded napkin, police arrested Hartmann. He has pleaded not guilty.May 18: William Earl Talbott II, 55, was apprehended by police in Snohomish County, Washington, for the 1987 murders of a young Canadian couple, Jay Cook, who had been strangled, and Tanya Van Cuylenborg, who had been raped. With a semen sample, Parabon NanoLabs traced his DNA to second cousins listed on the GEDMatch database and helped identify a suspect in two days. Talbott has pleaded not guilty.___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "641"}

The \u201caging in place\u201d concept depends on communication and event detection technologies such as those produced by Nest and other groups in the Google Home division.Google Home and Nest may not have focused on the senior market originally, but the large and growing number of people in the U.S. who wish to remain independent as they get older presents an opportunity the company may not want to pass up. More about aging in placeSources told CNBC that Nest has been talking with experts in aging, and with senior living facilities, about various ways in which its products could benefit seniors.Nest motion detection sensors can track behavior and take appropriate actions such as turning on interior home lights to help seniors\u2019 vision as they move about the house. Other examples include notifying remote family members or caregivers if an older person is sedentary most of the time or moving about too often when temperatures are excessively high.According to CNBC sources, Nest also may be exploring technology to predict falls by developing algorithms that analyze motion data looking for specific patterns and changes.Falls are the most frequent cause of injury and death from injury among people 65 and older in the U.S., reports the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC). Each year more than one of every four seniors falls, but fewer than half of the falls are reported. A combination of Google Home and Nest products could help detect falls and alert caregivers or emergency services.Stating that Nest\u2019s conversations with aging experts are increasing, CNBC\u2019s sources stressed that proposed product concepts for seniors are not commitments. However, Yoky Matsuoka, Nest chief technology officer, is speaking about technology impacting aging at a major conference this fall.

{"content": "July 27--Q: I am in sales and drive all over the Bay Area. I have lots of questions on different roads but let's start with the San Mateo Bridge. Why are there metering lights that are never used? I've been there at the peak of rush-hour and the merge is backed up through the toll booths, but the lights are not on.Ron RicardPleasant HillA: Your wait will continue for perhaps five more. Caltrans says the hardware for these meters were installed many years ago, but never activated. Priority has gone to installing meters on freeways, such as Highway 101, Interstate 880, I-80 and I-680.Anything else?Q: Also on the San Mateo Bridge, would it kill somebody to put up a windsock or something that we can tell how strong the cross winds are? There is often a warning for high winds, but it is impossible to tell how strong the winds are. A couple of windsocks would be very useful.Ron RicardA: No plans for wind socks. Jeff-the-Bridge-Man asks \"how would a person adjust their driving based on wind direction?\"Q: I see signs saying that the metering light from Andrade Road to north I-680 will be turned soon in Fremont. Since this is such a nasty area, how long will the hours be?Frank WhiteDanvilleA: They'll be on from 2 p.m. to 7 p.m. beginning Tuesday. This is the second phase of three metering projects along northbound I-680. The southbound direction is already metered during the morning peak hours.Beginning Tuesday, the meter will be solid green from 2 p.m. to 7 p.m. Monday through Friday, then flashing red to green a week later. The metering hotline is (510) 286-4531.Q: The Highway 85 north entrance from Almaden Expressway has metering lights. Instead of just red and green lights, there is also a yellow light. There is no sign that expresses whether it is one or two cars per green so by default everyone goes one car at a time.However, since the light flashes green then yellow then red, it seems like sufficient time for two cars to go per green/yellow. Is that supposed to be the case? If not, why does this metering light have a yellow light when most don't?LinSan JoseA: A ramp meter signal has a yellow signal for startup metering and two-cars per green metering. The yellow is needed when a meter goes from green to red. For two-cars per green metering, the second vehicle goes on the yellow. A yellow will also show up during the red-green cycle if there is an issue with the on-ramp detection system.Join Gary Richards for an hour-long chat noon Wednesday at www.mercurynews.com/live-chats.

{"content": "Aug. 02--SANTA CLARA -- Shanahan sees training camp as a fertile ground for players to hone their crafts without fear of social-media rebuke and public ridicule. Make mistakes now and correct them, rather than during the season, akin to a Cy Young winner testing out a new pitch in spring training.When Richard Sherman got burned by Marquise Goodwin to start Sunday's one-on-one drill, video of it sparked concerns web-wide over Sherman's comeback from Achilles repair. Shanahan saw it differently, and he replayed the video to his team Tuesday, commending Sherman for aggressively testing himself without fear of failure on a training-camp stage.Shanahan's thesis, as presented in Wednesday's media briefing:\"I just used it as an example. You guys have got to put yourselves in these players' shoes. We didn't used to get reports of stats on our practices and I don't get the reports and judge our guys off of them.\"You tell everyone to ignore them, but I guarantee people hear it, their wives hear it, someone hears it. You know Jimmy's completion percentage every day, how many picks he threw and I just try to put myself in players' shoes.\"You're going out trying to practice and get better at stuff, trying new things, stuff you don't always do in games and you're getting reports on stuff that you had a bad completion percentage or you can't do this.\"That stuff worries me for players because now I'm afraid they're going to go there and be like, 'Man, I know you want to try this new thing, but I don't want this to go viral for the next week, I don't want people to say I can't throw this type of ball.'\"Then they don't get better and they just try to survive the day so they can please people who don't really know what they're working on. It takes a very mentally strong person to not care about that.\"That's what I liked about Sherm on that play. I've been around a lot of successful corners who have a name that everyone knows and they get beat on a go-route and they hold their hamstring or they just ease up a little bit. I get it, that's probably what I would do, or I'd back up and be very scared. I'm not going to go try to jam one of the fastest guys on the planet on my first rep back knowing what's going to happen.\"I respect Sherm because he doesn't care. He's not worried about anything. He's out there working on his craft trying to get better and not caring what people say. That's why you get better from that rep.\"It's a good example to show young guys, to show everyone that that stuff doesn't matter. You getting better is what matters so you can do it on Sunday.\"Shanahan, in 18 months on the job, continues to win over players, fans and, yes, media with communication skills. He arrived with a reputation as a young, arrogant, know-it-all. Answers such as Wednesday's help rewrite that reputation, in that he's verbally outlining his thought process rather than dismissing those who don't know better.That's not to say Jimmy Garoppolo's 70.7 completion percentage in camp shouldn't be reported to stat-thirsty fans. It's just that everyone should know such stats and reports come with vast interpretation in a camp setting, where quarterbacks are not sacked, receivers run wrong routes and Shanahan may want to test a defender's technique.Then again, it's a stretch to say Sherman doesn't care about failure. Since that first rep against Goodwin, Sherman has been on top of his game, especially in the full-team drills, eager to reestablish himself as a top-notch cornerback, only one week into the forgivable classroom setting known as training camp.___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "644"}

(Photo by Denis Poroy/Getty Images)The San Diego Padres are bad but there are a few things they could to make the rest of this season watchable.Unless you spent the entire month of July on vacation, disconnected from everything, you know the San Diego Padres have been really bad, lately. Worse than usual. Coming off one of the worst months in Padres\u2019 baseball history, things don\u2019t appear to be looking up for the final two months of the season.Much of the struggles have come from the starting rotation, pitching to a 5.46 ERA, .350 OBP, and a near 10% walk rate. Clayton Richard entered Tyler Chatwood territory, posting a 6.9 BB/9 rate last month and a walk rate nearly double the size of his strikeout rate. Tyson Ross didn\u2019t fare much better, giving up five home runs and 15 walks in 23 innings.The offense was equally as depressing. As a team, the Padres hit .221, the second-lowest team batting average in Major League Baseball. They were one of only six teams that failed to score at least 100 runs in July and grounded into 22 double plays, fifth-most in baseball.As a result of the play on the field, watching San Diego Padres games are hard to do. I went back to work this week (high school teacher life) and found myself much more interested in useless back-to-school faculty meetings than in the Padres game that I had pulled up on my computer.Outside of playing better baseball (obviously), there are a few things the Padres could do to keep me interested throughout the rest of the season. Let\u2019s discuss three of the options that could spark a renewed interest.", "id": "645"}
{"content": "\u201cHere is the rule to remember in the future. When anything tempts you to be bitter: not, \u2018This is a misfortune\u2019 but \u2018To bear this worthily is good fortune.'\u201d \u2013 Marcus AureliusWhen misfortune enters our lives, we often wonder what we have done to bring trouble upon ourselves. Everyone experiences bad things in their lives from time to time. Dealing with setbacks is part of the human condition.

{"content": "One of the most frustrating things about trying to maintain a lustrous mane of hair is having to battle the damage and split ends. It seems no matter how much we trim and treat our hair; the elusive split end continues to haunt our heads. Over the years we\u2019ve just come to except that damaged hair always comes with the territory of coloring, straightening, and curling. Sometimes we can combat permanent damage by taking intermittent breaks in-between coloring and putting unnecessary heat on our hair. However, wouldn\u2019t it be great if we could keep our hair healthy and looking great at the same time? It\u2019s a little-known secret that you can achieve this with essential oils. The following is a list of those essential oils and how to use them to their fullest potential.Bergamot     Though it may have a bit of an off-putting sent, using the bergamot essential oils for hair growth can be very beneficial. Bergamot oils help to promote a healthy amount of blood circulation. This considerable increase helps to generate hair growth for even the most damaged hair follicles.In addition to hair growth, this essential oil is mainly used to soothe and calm anxious nerves. It\u2019s a great way to relieve some nervous tension when inhaled through a diffusor if you are prone to anxiety or panic attacks.Rosemary     Many would not even consider rosemary as anything other than a great spice to season roast chicken. Rosemary oils are a fantastic source of antioxidants that may prevent your hair from turning gray and thinning out.Rosemary essential oils are also an excellent flake buster. If you happen to suffer from a dry, itchy scalp, you may want to consider this particular oil as it is excellent for clearing pores and evening out the scalp\u2019s production of sebum.PeppermintPeppermint is one of, if not the best essential oils for hair growth. Like it\u2019s fellow herb rosemary, it works to unclog pores and prevent a flaky scalp. It\u2019s most predominant power, however, is the amount of blood flow it can generate to the scalp upon application. It\u2019s also a great stimulator of the mind as well. When inhaled through a diffusor, peppermint can help to wake-up the senses and increase your vigor to get things done.     ChamomileIf peppermint is the go-getter, then chamomile is the ultimate relaxer. There\u2019s nothing better for the soul than a hot cup of chamomile tea right before bed. It\u2019s soothing properties, and faint apple scent are a great bring-me-down after a rather invigorating day. The oils made from the plant are an excellent conditioning agent that will shield your hair from further damage. You can even use chamomile oils as a leave-in conditioner as it is much less greasy than most oils and does not leave behind a sticky residue.LemonLemon is a great clarifying essential oil. When we think of lemon, we generally think of clean or sanitized. This is because lemon is an organic antiseptic which will help to clear up any excessive shampoo residue that may be lingering in your hair after washing. When hair is not weighed down by heavy product, it is given the freedom to grow on a more regular basis.Tea TreeTea tree oil is probably one of the most commonly used essential oils on the market. When used on the face in diluted portions it can decimate a pimple practically over-night. You must be careful with the level of tea tree oil that you use in any capacity because it is so potent.When used on the scalp, it can help to prevent hair fall by providing your hair with some much-needed nutrients that it may not be receiving through your everyday shampoo and conditioning routine.PatchouliPatchouli is another one of those essential oils with a rather unsavory scent. Unpleasant smells aside, it is one of the most naturally beneficial anti-inflammatory oils out there. Someone who suffers from eczema, for example, would benefit significantly from this oil. When used on the scalp it can prevent inflammation and dandruff, a leading cause of hair loss.Each of these oils is special in their own way, but they all contribute to the same cause. It is imperative to understand that the only way you will see results with any of these essential oils is to be consistent with your use of them. You should not expect to see results overnight, apart from the tea tree oil. When used on a regular basis, any combination of these oils is sure to yield results within a month. You must remember that trying to reverse hair damage will take time, but it is entirely possible with the consistent use of these oils.", "id": "647"}

Augur is a protocol through which people can create prediction markets, which are crowdsourced platforms where people stake cryptocurrency (in this case Ethereum and the Augur-specific token Reputation) on a prediction\u2019s most likely outcome.Winners get a payoff while losers part ways with their crypto. Ideally, it would be like betting on roulette but instead of colors and numbers, you\u2019re trying to predict the future to create an accurate record of important events in the process.Via a distributed blockchain ledger, people could predict anything from political elections to the weather, and do so totally free of censorship from any regulatory body.That also makes it a great place for unethical bets \u2014 like those that predict whether a celebrity or politician will die this year.These bets give people a chance to make money in seedy (or illegal) ways. For instance, someone could have an accomplice predict that a particular public figure will live to see 2019, or find an existing bet where most people think the person will survive. Then, that person could make sure they win by killing the person.That\u2019s not only deeply unethical and illegal, it\u2019s rigging the game. Staking a lot of crypto on \u201cthat person will die\u201d then going out and killing them is like betting on the worst horse in the race then kneecapping all the others.The Forecast Foundation launched Augur then took a step back, clarifying that it has no intention of controlling or censoring what people choose to do with the platform. So it\u2019s up to the Augur community to figure out what to do here, and, perhaps unsurprisingly, participants cannot agree on how to approach it. Some argue that the so-called assassination wagers are too small and infrequent to be taken seriously; others believe that nothing should be done. What the market wants, the market gets, in true libertarian blockchain fashion.Augur has ignored Futurism\u2019s multiple requests for comment on these assassination threads. On Thursday, Motherboard reported that Augur responded to their interview requests about the same by redirecting them to a FAQ page that described how Augur and the Forecast Foundation are totally decentralized \u2014 they couldn\u2019t censor certain predictions even if they wanted to.Troublesome predictions like those that popped up on Augur (Betty White? Really?) are an unfortunate reality and inseparable from the big promise of the blockchain. Every well-intentioned site on the internet, from reddit to Faceboook and beyond, has been bogged down by people being their worst selves. Whether it\u2019s the platforms\u2019 fault or the individual\u2019s is, at this point, pointless to try to dissect. Anyone founding a new platform who pretends they don\u2019t need to protect against the worst of the internet is, at best, na\u00efve.And there are real consequences for this optimism. Just as major social media outlets like Facebook and YouTube are struggling to balance free speech while regulating hate speech, unmoderated prediction markets can give a platform for the types of abuse that already plague social media (and, you know, literal murder.) For most people, this may be inconsequential. But marginalized communities and people who achieve even a modicum of public recognition \u2014 those who are already shouted down and harassed elsewhere on the internet \u2014 once more stand to suffer the most if those with the power to do so don\u2019t step in and add necessary protections and filters.Blockchain is the latest optimistic technology to be tested with the internet\u2019s bile. Blockchain is poised to revolutionize the world, if its advocates are to be believed. It will change the way we do business, the way we hold governments accountable, and usher in a new era of freedom for those who buy in. If we just trust people and give them a platform that cannot be touched by a regulatory authority or overreaching government, then the decency of the group will prevail and a technological utopia becomes possible.But to pretend that bad actors don\u2019t exist, or to claim that \u201ccensorship\u201d is the same as \u201cstepping in to prevent people from making money off of actual murder\u201d is simply irresponsible. It\u2019s an unfortunate footnote to the blockchain sales pitch: if some bad apples want to gamble on high-profile murders, well, hey have we told you about how much money we raised?By sweeping Augur users\u2019 unethical wagers under the rug, the Forecast Foundation shows that it implicitly agrees that some truly horrendous things have to happen in order for the big blockchain promise to work, for decentralized apps and computing to truly achieve what many hope they will. Ugliness is simply a side effect, a casualty of progress.These bets on people\u2019s lives aren\u2019t just some quirky side effect of a prediction marketplace, they are examples of people using Augur exactly as advertised and intended, albeit for unfortunate reasons. And if there\u2019s a problem, well, someone else will have to deal with it.On Augur or any other predictions marketplace, anyone who wagers that a celebrity will soon die in an assassination thread (let\u2019s give them the benefit of the doubt and call them longevity predictions) becomes financially incentivized to make that death happen. Hopefully, none of that comes to pass.But unfortunately, at the very least, we know that they\u2019re rooting for it.", "id": "649"}
{"content": "Papa John's founder, John Schnatter, is no shrinking violet. The founder of Papa John's International Inc. (PZZA) has been, until recently, the face, voice and spirit behind the chain. That was before Schnatter resigned as board chairman on July 11, following a news account published that day in Forbes, that he used the N-word during a media training session in May. Since then, Schnatter, who remains a director and the company's largest shareholder, has been in a pitched battle against his namesake pizza chain. The company voided Schnatter's founder's agreement, meaning that he is no longer a company, canceled the lease on his office at the firm's Louisville, Ky., headquarters, and adopted a poison pill to keep Schnatter and his associates from gaining a larger share of the company. Schnatter and his legal team have countered by suing the company to inspect the books and accusing them of engaging in a media blitz that keeps the dispute front and center. Papa John's reports second-quarter earnings Aug. 7. On Thursday, Aug. 2, Schnatter talked with TheStreet by phone.  TheStreet: After all that's happened, what's your thinking about the company? Schnatter: The farther I get away from Papa John's the worse its seems to do. Some of that is that the company has made decisions to push me away from the company. Yet, the more they push me away, the worse the things seem to get, which I don't like. With [nearly] 30% ownership, I want the company to do well. If the stock was $80 a share and sales were positive, you and I wouldn't be having this conversation. The reason we're talking is that Papa John's has been on the decline for a year-and-a-half to two years, and I'm not seeing any direction, any leadership, any plan in place to change that trajectory. Note: Schnatter was company CEO till December 2017, having taken over the spot for the third time in December 2008. During those years, the stock ranged from around $9 to $59 a share. Since he stepped down as CEO in 2017, the stock price has ranged from $59 to $42. Schnatter remained as board chairman till July 11. From Jan. 2, 2018 till July 11, the stock went from $57 to $50. Shares of Papa John's traded at $42.47 per share on Friday afternoon.  What's your impression of senior management and the board?  Schnatter: If you look at the pattern of [CEO] Steve Ritchie and upper management and the board, it's a simple pattern. Steve goes out and promises the moon, he promises good things. He never delivers on them. And he blames somebody else, usually me. That process repeats itself. And I'm sure it will repeat itself next week on the [earnings] call. You'll probably hear it. Just stay tuned. At the same time, the board just sticks their head in the sand and pretends everything is OK. Steve needs help, he is drowning. That's why I've recommended to the board that they begin a search for a new CEO. NOTE: Ritchie worked his way up the ranks in the company, starting as a $6-an-hour customer service representative in 1996, then became a franchisee in 2006. In 2014, he began working directly under Schnatter as the company's COO. In a Dec. 21, 2017, press release on the company's site, here's what Schnatter had to say about Ritchie upon his promotion to CEO: \"I am so proud of Steve -- he has excelled at every job he's ever held at Papa John's -- from being an hourly customer service rep, to a delivery driver, store general manager, director of operations, franchisee and most recently president.\" Olivia Kirtley was unanimously elected as the board chair, replacing you. Did you vote for Kirtley, and what do you think of her? Schnatter: Yes, I did vote for her, but  I have some concerns about Olivia. I think the board's behavior is reckless. It's hasty, I don't think it's well thought-out, I don't think it's in the shareholders best interest and not in the board's best interest. I'm very concerned that Olivia Kirtley and [board member] Mark Shapiro will do to Papa John's what Shapiro did to Six Flags. NOTE: According to news accounts in The Deal, the sister publication of TheStreet, as Six Flags Inc. CEO, Shapiro inherited the problem of significant debt at Six Flags as a result of an acquisition spree in the 1990's. The company tried to avert a bankruptcy filing, but could not. It emerged from bankruptcy in April 2010 and changed its name to Six Flags Entertainment Corp. Shortly thereafter, Shapiro was abruptly replaced as CEO and no explanation for his departure was given, according to a Reuters story. According to a source close to the company, Schnatter recruited Shapiro to be a board member. He's been an independent director for seven years.  A 'bro' culture, a hostile workplace toward women, at Papa John's was reported in a July 19 Forbes article. Is that true?  Schnatter: When I was there up till the end of '16, I didn't see anything that was close to what the Forbes article said. After digging into this, and by the way, I wouldn't have tolerated it, not for one second. Everyone in the building knows I wouldn't have tolerated the nonsense that was going on.  Where that's coming from is that there's a department called OST, operation specialists training, run by Edmond Heelan [senior vice president-North American operation]. And therein lies the problem. Edmond is Steve Ritche's right-hand man. You look at the vulgar language, the disrespect toward women, the promiscuous behavior, the nefarious behavior, it all comes out of Edmond Heelan. OST was an arm away from anything I would have seen. Should I have seen it? Yes. Did I sense something was going on? Yes, but I had no idea it was to the degree of just bad behavior, rude, crude and unacceptable that it was. Externally, it's called OST. Internally, it's called the Club. They [members] have a bond that they will protect each other no matter what. It's a clique, it's a frat, a fraternity, mostly made up of men, with some women, and all are Papa John's employees. NOTE: Attempts by TheStreet to reach Heelan were unsuccessful. Any regrets? Schnatter: Any regrets? I don't like this situation any more than anyone else does. I would have done anything in my power to keep this from happening because it's not good for my employees. What's the upside in all this for you? Schnatter: I'm not real worried about me right now. If I take care of the employees, the franchisees, the customers, and I'm good to my communities, I'll be fine.  Is there an upside for the company? I sure hope so, because I own 30% of the company. Papa John's declined TheStreet's request to speak with Ritchie, Kirtley, Shapiro and Heelan or to respond to Schnatter's comments.", "id": "650"}
{"content": "Aug. 02--The loud new world that is podcasting can resemble a neighborhood tavern, filled with a wild assortment of characters, running the audio gamut from compelling to nap-inducing.Simply put, a podcast is a digital audio file or recording that can be downloaded from a website to a media player or computer. Podcasts are usually free to listeners and can often be created for little to no cost -- and thus has this become a realm that attracts, well, anybody who can talk. If you don't already know someone who is podcasting, you surely know someone who thinks they should be podcasting.One of the most recent entries to the ever-crowded audio arena is \"As the Ale House Turns,\" which pairs a couple of the city's most creative people, known as The Genius and Pub Crawl Liz (or writer/artist/bar proprietor Bruce Cameron Elliott and historian/entrepreneur Liz Garibay).There have been a dozen episodes so far, each roughly an hour in length and available for listening at soundcloud.com or on Apple's iTunes.They are recorded every Tuesday evening from 7:30 to 8:30 at a table in the window of the Old Town Ale House at 219 W. North Ave. in Chicago.\"There is a certain magic to be a regular at this bar, and we want to capture that,\" says Garibay. \"This is the way we would talk to each other whether there was a mic in front of us or not.\"There is a theme song with original lyrics set to the tune of Jim Croce's \"Bad, Bad Leroy Brown,\" but there is no theme to the conversations. Is there another podcast that has featured conversations about golfing with Barack Obama, the poetry of William Butler Yeats, Roger Ebert, sexual adventures and misadventures, Prince Charles' ears, Queen Elizabeth, Chicago's Walter Jacobson and opinions about almost anything?The conversations between the two hosts are unpredictable, playful, provocative and smart.\"And we can be contentious,\" he says.\"Let's just say we have a very interesting relationship,\" she says.She goes on, saying, \"He is one minute the endearing father figure, the next minute the annoying little brother, or the needy child or the dirty uncle.\"Elliott laughs, punctuating the palpable affection between these two who have known one another for a long time. So have I, and I have told you about them over the past years.Garibay is a child of Old Town, having grown up a few blocks from the Ale House, the youngest of four children and the first in her family to be born in the United States and not in Mexico.She went to St. Ignatius College Prep and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, earning a B.A. in anthropology; worked as public programs manager at the Chicago Historical Society (now the Chicago History Museum); began a blog and later a website, History on Tap (historyontap.com), that focused on history and culture as observed through the lens of booze; and began conducting popular History Pub Crawls for the CHM and then independently.\"I like to think that my work serves as inspiration and proof that education and socialization actually work,\" she has told me.It was she who suggested to Elliott that they start a podcast. \"I didn't even known what a podcast was,\" Elliott says. \"Liz said she'd take care of everything, and that was a year and a half ago.\"\"Hey, I've been busy,\" Garibay says. \"I have other stuff going on.\"Indeed. In addition to conducting her tours, she formed a 501(c)(3) organization and gathered a board of directors with the intention of opening a museum dedicated to beer, to be called the Brewseum (chicagobrewseum.org). \"We are moving nicely along,\" she says.Elliott is always busy. In addition to his various duties at the tavern (he and his then-wife inherited it a decade ago from its previous owners, Beatrice and Arthur Klug), he paints (his nude of Sarah Palin attracted national newspaper and TV attention in 2008) and he writes.At the prompting of the aforementioned Ebert, he started a blog in 2009 called Geriatric Genius and that came to the attention of the late Anthony Bourdain, who prominently featured Elliott in one of his \"Parts Unknown\" episodes on CNN and persuaded Elliott to gather some of his blog writings into a book.That was \"Last Night at the Old Town Ale House,\" which started on the conventional publishing route until, as Elliott says, \"The people at HarperCollins told me it was the most libelous, defamatory book they had ever seen.\"So he self-published it, with an introduction by Bourdain, and then \"Portrait of the Genius as a Young Man\" and a few weeks ago the third in this ongoing autobiographical series, \"California Jail Break.\"This one follows his escapades after he departs this clime under somewhat threatening circumstances for the West Coast. It is peppered with encounters with such people as the Grateful Dead, Sen. Eugene McCarthy and Wilt Chamberlain, who, Elliott writes, \"(during a basketball game) stepped over the first row of seats and grabbed me by the shirt just below my throat and lifted me off the ground effortlessly.\"But back to the podcast.It is produced by Jordan Stalling, and its associate producer, who is also Elliott's girlfriend, is a delightful woman who goes by \"Rock N' Roll Ruth.\" (She is also the person who snapped the photo of actor Michael Shannon watching the latest Oscars telecast at the Ale House while his film, \"The Shape of Water,\" won best picture; the photo became a viral internet sensation).Garibay sees her podcast role simply as \"trying to control the guy.\"Unlike some podcasts, which are little more than self-promotional ego fests, \"As the Ale House Turns,\" while not without egos, is no commercial for the pair's various endeavors.So far, there haven't been many guests, with the exception of a short and weird chat with regular Street Jimmy and a very lively hour with former print-TV newsman Andy Shaw. The podcast pair plan to have Shannon on soon enough, and who knows who else might drop and sit in a chair at a table in the Ale House window and ramble on about, well, who knows?rkogan@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "651"}
{"content": "July 27--As residents in and around the Northern California city of Redding scrambled early Friday to escape the deadly Carr Fire encroaching from the west, social media platforms lit up with desperate messages, offers of help, and calls for more press coverage of the devastating wildfire. You can actually hear the panic and fear in tweets like this:The explosive wildfire tore through the small towns of Shasta and Keswick before crossing the Sacramento River on Thursday. It's now burning in Redding, a city of about 91,000 straddling the river at the junction of Interstate 5 and Highway 299. The fire has already left a trail of tragedy and destruction: two firefighters have been killed and dozens of structures have been destroyed, prompting panicked residents to flee their homes with little more than what they can carry in their hands.The Carr Fire is \"taking down everything in its path,\" said Scott McLean, a CalFire spokesman for the crews battling the blaze.Residents in the western part of Redding who hadn't been under evacuation orders were caught off guard and had to flee with little notice, causing miles-long traffic jams as flames turned the skies orange. \"When it hit, people were really scrambling,\" McLean said. \"There was not much of a warning.\"Meanwhile on social media, the anxious conversation unfolded:Readers of this newspaper also weighed in.\"Thurs' breezes picked up mid-afternoon thru evening and will again today,\" wrote \"Jay Cupertino.\" \"Quiet mornings give a false sense of security, as if Redding's crisis has passed: NOT. Btw, get used to an age of catastrophic wildfires. Even now, with just a modestly warmer earth, and much worse in your kids' lifetime.\"Another reader wondered why \"the US govt or California is not buying up those big nearly obsolete 747's and the like that sit in the Arizona desert and (convert) them to firefighting tankers. They could be bought relatively cheaply for scrap prices. These monster fires are with us every year, and we seem hopeless and helpless.\"Buy them up and have them at the ready,\" the commenter wrote. \"These fire losses are devastating and preventable, and likely to increase.\"___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "652"}
{"content": "July 30--The bucket-wearing fan injured when a falling metal pin from the Wrigley Field center field scoreboard hit him on the head last week said he's fortunate the Cubs were losing at the time.If he hadn't been wearing the plastic bucket on his head as a Cubs \"rally cap,\" Kyle McAleer believes he might have been killed.\"Absolutely,\" he said. \"It's purely speculation, but the way it hit me ... if the Cubs weren't losing I would not have been wearing that bucket. It might have fractured my skull. It definitely could have been fatal. I am extremely lucky.\"McAleer was sitting with family and friends under the old center field scoreboard during the Cubs-Diamondbacks game July 24, the day before his 20th birthday. When Kyle Hendricks gave up three runs in the fifth inning, McAleer said it was time for him and his dad and a friend to put on the \"rally\" buckets, which actually were empty bubble gum containers purchased a few years earlier at a Sam's Club.After the bottom of the fifth, a loose, 6- to 8-inch metal pin that holds the score tiles in place fell from the scoreboard and struck McAleer in the head.\"I wouldn't be surprised if all the people in the bleachers heard that loud thud,\" he said.McAleer said there was \"considerable pain, but (it was) more shocking than anything else,\" because his ears were ringing.The impact forced the bucket downward and knocked his glasses off. He first thought someone had thrown a bottle at him, before he saw blood rushing down from a laceration right above his hairline.The Cubs' medical team responded quickly, and McAleer was sent to Illinois Masonic Medical Center for treatment. He said he was conscious all along and documented the incident on his Snapchat account.The Cubs regained the pin, which McAleer estimated weighed about 3 to 4 pounds.McAleer was released around 11:30 p.m. and went back to his hometown of Scranton, Iowa, the next day. The cracked bucket that may have saved his life still has blood on it and is sitting on a shelf in his house.\"It's amazing, the coincidence,\" he said. \"That scoreboard has been around 81 years and this is the first time this has ever happened. And it just happened to fall on the kid wearing a plastic bucket on his head?\"I mean, what are the odds, man? I'm dumbfounded. I think about it and I just have to stop and go, 'Wow, man.' \"McAleer's biggest regret, he said, was having to miss the seventh-inning stretch.Cubs spokesman Julian Green said last week the incident resulted from \"a loose pin that rolled out of the scoreboard when the tile was being changed,\" adding \"there are no loose pins and the scoreboard is secure.\"The Cubs did not respond to messages Monday.After the news broke, many were confused as to why McAleer was wearing a bucket on his head. He confirmed the containers were a tribute to bubble gum buckets former Cubs infielder Starlin Castro and other players wore during celebrations during the 2015 season.McAleer since has been in contact with the Cubs, who gave him some gifts, including a new Addison Russell jersey. He praised the Cubs' quick response and said there has been no decision about legal action down the road.\"If it was any other injury than a head injury, chances are this already would have been settled,\" he said. \"But the fact it was a head injury, and there's still a definite possibility I could suffer concussion symptoms within a couple of weeks or months after the incident ...\"I still have multiple doctor visits. I have to get the staples removed, I have to get a second opinion on my head.

{"content": "July 31--Charlie Sheen has come to the defense of Roseanne Barr.Not so sure he'd be my first -- or 100th -- choice of ally, but Barr could use as many friends as she can find these days.According to US Weekly, Sheen says he understands too well the backlash that Barr has had to endure following her controversial tweet about Valerie Jarrett, a former aide to President Barack Obama who is African-American. Barr said she looked like the child of the \"muslim brotherhood &amp; planet of the apes.\"\"I can relate to that tone of absolute despair because it's not just about herself, it's about the people that she knows she affected as well,\" Sheen said during an appearance Monday on the \"Kyle and Jackie O Show\" on Australian radio. \"What I hear in her voice, trying not to focus on the words but the emotion, is I hear the frustration, pain. There's a sadness there.\"The condemnation of Barr, 65, has been swift and nearly unanimous. ABC canceled the highly successful \"Roseanne\" reboot only to bring it back as \"The Conners\" minus Barr, her agency dropped her, and she was widely criticized -- including by \"Roseanne\" cast members -- as a racist for the tweet.Barr's backed-into-a-corner reaction has only brought her more grief. First, she said she wasn't herself when she made the early morning tweet about Jarrett because she was on Ambien, and later claimed that she thought Jarrett, whom she referred to as \"the bitch,\" was white. She also played the victim, claiming she was fired from her sitcom because of her support for President Donald Trump.Sheen can relate to being a Hollywood pariah. He was fired from the CBS sitcom \"Two and Half Men\" in 2011 following his criticism of co-creator Chuck Lorre. He reacted by going all unhinged on a number of television interviews. He claimed to be a warlock, a \"Vatican assassin\" and a \"rock star from Mars, and that he had \"tiger blood\" and \"Adonis DNA.\" And there was also the now infamous quote of him, \"Duh, winning.\"Sheen, 52, originally castigated Barr, 65, by tweeting, \"adios Rosanne! good riddance. hashtag not winning.\" He said he now regrets it.\"The thing that is a little bit sad is that when someone does melt, everything good they have ever done that has entertained millions of people is forgotten,\" Sheen said during his Australian radio interview. \"I shouldn't have said 'Roseanne good riddance.' because whatever happened, she's been nothing but nice to me in the past so that part I would delete.\"In the same tweet in which he addressed Barr, Sheen also hinted at a possible \"Three and Half Men\" reboot with him back on board.\"the runway is now clear for OUR reboot. #CharlieHarperReturns,\" he said, attaching an image of a script.So a reboot.

{"content": "Liverpool are close to securing the services of attacker Sadio Mane for another five years.Earlier this summer, the Reds were able to ink in Mo Salah and Roberto Firmino for the next five years. However, one key piece was missing. The lightning-quick left winger.Mane was linked earlier in the summer to Real Madrid, but those rumors were shut down fairly quickly by the media and the player himself.It has been rumored for the entire summer Liverpool were planning to offer him a new contract, but nothing had actually happened. Now they hope to lock the Senegal forward down for five years, and make him one of the highest paid Liverpool players \u2013 said the Mirror.Apply to Rush The Kop.Start your application process by filling out the fields belowMane bagged 20 goals for the Reds in the 2017-2018, his sophomore season with the club. Even in this year\u2019s pre-season it looks as if he has not lost a step, and that is form is still rising. Liverpool\u2019s offense looked stagnant without any of their normal front three players on the pitch. The team\u2019s movement was slow, easy to read, and wasn\u2019t able to create worthy chances against sub-par teams.But there is just something special you can feel when Mane comes onto the field. Its as if there is a new life for the team to play for. Many will not agree with this but Sadio is as much a creator as he is a finisher, he understands how to move without the ball and how to create and find space which is imperative when playing alongside Firmino and Salah.As important as Mane is to the starting XI, when you add Firmino and Salah to the mix they get incrementally better. It is very much a story of \u201cthe whole is greater than the sum of its parts\u201d. It is not that they are not phenomenal footballers, because they are. However, those three compliment each other so well, it makes each of them exponentially better. That is the genius of Jurgen Klopp and this Liverpool side.This is the reason why this long term deal is just as important as any new signing we have made in recent weeks. The Senegalese sensation is key to this squad\u2019s success, and Liverpool will need him going forward. Hopefully, he will play the duration of his career at Anfield with this new contract as Klopp was quoted by The Echo saying,\u201cThat is what I meant when I spoke about the mood in the club, that\u2019s not only in the stands, we are Liverpool as a team and the boys want to be part of it. That\u2019s really cool and it\u2019s a big achievement for the club because these boys, Bobby Firmino, Mo Salah and Sadio Mane, and a lot of the others as well, could play for pretty much any team in the world. That\u2019s how it is and a good sign for the club. It is an improved situation that these players don\u2019t use us and then go. It\u2019s cool but now we all together have to deliver. Sign your contracts but now, go again\u201d.It is great to see that Klopp is so dedicated to the long term future of Liverpool, and not just the short term. He wants to build a smooth running machine that will conquer for years to come. If Mane does agree to the new deal, Firmino, Salah, and Mane will be inked until 2023, which gives Jurgen plenty of time to bring home some trophies to Merseyside.", "id": "655"}
{"content": "Aug. 02--NAPA -- Speaking of his first go-round with the Raiders Gruden said, \"I had guys on my team who didn't know who Jack Tatum was. Who didn't know who Art Shell was. When I did 'Gruden's QB camp, I'd show old footage of Tim Brown. They didn't know who Tim Brown was. These were quarterbacks, guys who were thriving. Up and coming prospects.\"There will be no such problem Thursday, as former Colts and Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning was at the Napa Valley Marriott to speak with the Raiders. Nor was it a problem Wednesday night, when Charles Woodson addressed the team.Gruden believes there is much insight to be gained from great players, whether the young ones know who they are or not.\"It's a great way to learn,\" Gruden told the Bay Area News Group. \"Why is this guy a Hall of Fame player? Let me tell you why Jerry Rice is in the Hall of Fame. Let me show you why Jerry Rice is in the Hall of Fame. \"Maybe you can steal some things. That's what I've learned from a lot of great players. They're always borrowing and stealing and tweaking their schedules, tweaking their diet.\"Manning's singular devotion to the NFL always impressed Gruden. The two became friends when Gruden coached the AFC team at the Pro Bowl following the 2000 season. Visits to the NFL scouting combine in Indianapolis usually included a visit to Manning's home to watch film and talk strategy over a couple of beverages.Gruden even used his admiration for Manning to tweak his own starter Rich Gannon. When Gruden did a weekly diary for NFL.com in 2001 (I was his ghost writer), he said he called Manning \"The Sheriff\" and Gannon \"The Deputy.\" The idea was to thicken Gannon's skin.Then at practice, Gruden instructed the support staff he brought from the Raiders to Honolulu to gaze in admiration when Manning was going through passing drills. Standing on the sidelines, they would go \"Oooh\" and \"Ahh\" at every throw. When it was Gannon's turn, they remained silent.Finally, after Manning threw an errant pass, Gannon approached the sideline and barked, \"There!

{"content": "July 27--We're searching for a description of the Chinese government's behavior and can't decide among bullying, extortion or coercion. The White House went with \"Orwellian nonsense.\" Geopolitical chutzpah also comes to mind.What Beijing did was demand international airlines -- including United, American and Delta -- change their websites to pretend Taipei is no longer the capital of Taiwan.Because China claims Taiwan as Chinese territory, it doesn't want to see any references contradicting that assertion. Therefore, book a flight on United and Taipei seems to float in space because \"Taiwan\" has been deleted from the listing. At some foreign airlines, including British Airways and Air France, China's conquest of Taiwan appears complete. Both carriers list Taipei as a city in \"Taiwan, China.\"This is a symbolic power move by China. It has the feel of Cold War-era propaganda, but let's not dismiss it as simply playing games with maps. China is a rising military power with long-term ambitions to challenge the United States in the Pacific. Look at the South China Sea and you'll find the Chinese have done more than monkey with place names: The People's Liberation Army dredged sand to create islands with military installations in order to bolster claims of sovereignty over an expanse of ocean with crucial shipping lanes.Taiwan as a potential flashpoint dates to the 1949 Chinese revolution. As communist forces took control, the Nationalists -- led by Chiang Kai-shek -- fled across the strait to Taiwan, which developed separately. Beijing never relinquished its claim, while Taiwan never proclaimed independence, leaving the island with an intentionally fuzzy identity. Taiwan is a self-ruled democracy, a key trading partner with both the U.S. and China, and it has a security relationship with the United States. But officially, Washington has diplomatic relations with Beijing, not Taipei. The status quo is odd, yet it works.Then every once in a while China tries to assert dominance, by, say, demanding that airlines change their references to Taiwan. Europeans meekly obliged. U.S. carriers tried holding out, but China could strip them of landing rights on the mainland or banish them from websites there. Fighting back would take a bigger effort by the U.S. government and U.S. business.If China believes so strongly in symbolic actions, then let's make the message clear: Bullying airlines into fudging Taiwan's identity is an act of political aggression. American executives trying to do business on the mainland know they should be mistrustful of the Chinese government. Now they'll get an extra reminder each time they consult a route map of Asia.Join the discussion on Twitter @Trib_Ed_Board and on Facebook.Submit a letter to the editor here or email letters@chicagotribune.com.___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "658"}
{"content": "July 27--The Obama Foundation has pushed back the groundbreaking date for the Obama Presidential Center after the federal review process was delayed for a second time this summer, officials confirmed Friday.Instead of starting construction later this year, the foundation is now saying they plan to break ground for the half-billion-dollar project sometime in 2019. Officials avoided setting a specific date during the year. They also would not say if this will change their timeline for building the center, which was once slated to open in 2021.\"We have a sense of urgency about this project (and) when we started, we wanted the public to know we would break ground as soon as possible,\" said Michael Strautmanis, the vice president for civic engagement for the foundation. \"But we also knew there were some things that were not in our control. We insist on going through the process with integrity and without rushing.\"Before the presidential center can be built, the federal government will review its impact on Jackson Park, which is on the National Register of Historic Places, and evaluate the project's environmental effects. Any impact that the review highlights will have to be resolved before construction can be allowed.There have already been two public federal review meetings. A third was scheduled in June, but then it was delayed until July. Now it has been delayed until late summer, according to the city of Chicago's website.The federal review process has to be conducted because of Jackson Park's historic status and because it involved closing and expanding major streets.The news of the delay comes just a day after activists gathered on the South Side at a meeting to discuss placing a community benefits agreement proposition on the February ballot.\"We have a new window of opportunity before the next election to protect the most vulnerable people in our community,\" said Parrish Brown, an activist with the Black Youth Project 100 Chicago Chapter, in a written statement. \"We're gathering to make sure Mayor (Rahm) Emanuel and the local aldermen do the right thing, or we'll have to elect people who will.\"The coalition wants an ordinance that would require that 30 percent of all newly constructed housing near the presidential center be set aside as affordable housing. They want a property tax freeze for the longtime homeowners closest to the site and an independent monitor to make sure local residents are hired to work on the project. In addition, they are now calling for a community trust fund and support for the neighborhood schools.The Obama Presidential Center is expected to be a sprawling campus with three buildings that will contain a museum, meeting rooms, an athletic center and a public library branch. The project is expected to bring thousands of visitors to the South Side, create about 2,500 permanent jobs and infuse the local community with tourist dollars.But from the time the project was announced, it has been embattled as some residents have disagreed with where it will be constructed and the pace of the project. Others have pushed for an iron-clad contract guaranteeing certain amenities to vulnerable residents who currently live nearby.In May, the Chicago City Council approved measures that essentially granted permission for the center to be built.The foundation has already hired a collective of construction firms to do the work, and those firms have started their community outreach. But they still have to train and develop a workforce, and negotiate a long term lease with the city.Construction of the center will be paid for with private donations, but the city is expected to make about $175 million in improvements to roads and underpasses around the site.lbowean@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "659"}

{"content": "Apple is ready to ditch Qualcomm components from future iPhones, relying instead on Intel for the parts. The move is the latest development in Apple and Qualcomm\u2019s nasty legal battle over royalties. ( Don Emmert | AFP/Getty Images )Apple's relationship with Qualcomm is coming to a bitter end. On a recent earnings call, Qualcomm CFO George Davis confirmed that the Cupertino brand intends to drop its modems from future iPhones.Apple will instead rely on other companies for the component going forward. While Qualcomm didn't mention Intel, it's the only other supplier of that component for Apple's smartphones.\"We believe Apple intends to solely use our competitor's modems rather than our modems in its next iPhone release,\" said Davis, as CNET reports. \"We will continue to provide modems for Apple legacy devices.\"Apple Is Ready To Drop QualcommIf true, it's not surprising. Earlier this July, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said Apple will be ditching Qualcomm as the sole supplier of cellular modems following its legal fallout with the chipmaker.Apple began using both Intel and Qualcomm modems ever since 4G networks rolled out, but the latter company has long been aggressive in claiming that its components are faster. Just recently, it showed off test speeds for the forthcoming Snapdragon 845 chip, claiming its products are superior to Intel's.How Qualcomm Makes MoneyMost of Qualcomm's profits come from licensing smartphone radios and chips to other companies, and Apple is one of its biggest customers. However, the two companies have been battling it out in court over royalty payments since 2017. Apple initially sued Qualcomm for allegedly overcharging to use its LTE modems, whereupon Qualcomm counter-sued, saying Apple actually owned it more money in royalties and that it infringed on some of its patents and shared proprietary information with rival Intel.Qualcomm has also been attempting to get iPhone sales banned in the United States, but to no avail.What Happens When 5G Rolls Around?The relationship between both companies has now turned into nothing but ashes, which could significantly impact Apple once Qualcomm's 5G modems ship later this year. Intel, on the other hand, has said it won't have 5G chips until 2019. There's a chance Apple will try to cozy up to Qualcomm once it feels a little bit behind on the 5G bandwagon, although that seems highly unlikely since their formal business relationship appears to be beyond repair at this point.Apple is also said to be exploring other components from Qualcomm it can drop, such as Bluetooth chips and Wi-Fi modems. Generally, though, Apple wants to be as independent as possible going forward. Heck, it's even rumored to be developing a proprietary chip for MacBooks.Do you think it's wise for Apple to be dropping Qualcomm, especially in the impending arrival of true 5G?

{"content": "Walmart is moving ahead with its plan to create a video streaming service. It has apparently hired the former CEO of cable company Epix to kickstart development. ( Walmart )Earlier this month, Tech Times reported that Walmart was considering its own video streaming service to compete with the likes of Netflix, Amazon, and Hulu. At the time, however, it wasn't clear whether the retail chain was serious about such prospects.Turns out it's very serious, indeed. Walmart, according to new reports, has apparently enlisted the services of Mark Greenberg to help develop the streaming platform. It's a smart hire \u2014 Greenberg is more than capable of what's being asked of him, having been the CEO of Epix, a premium cable and satellite television network. He left the role in September 2017.Details About Walmart's Video Streaming ServiceWalmart's streaming service will allegedly run separate from Vudu, the video service it purchased in 2010 as a bid to make its smart TV offerings more robust. As per Variety, this service would be firmly targeted at Walmart's core demographic, with content primarily targeted at \"Middle America.\"It will also be inexpensive. The retail company is said to be targeting a monthly subscription price of around $8, which would put it $2 below Netflix's standard asking price. It's not clear whether or not Walmart plans to offer original content, as virtually each of its would-be rivals does. Original movies and TV shows are the bread and butter of any streaming service since it's a huge part of what'll convince people to pay for a monthly subscription in the first place.Still In The Early StagesReports say Walmart's plans are still very much in the early stages. So it's no surprise Walmart and Greenberg are keeping mum on the whole affair. The company certainly has its work cut out for it, though. Netflix won't be a piece of cake to compete with \u2014 it's responsible for 73 percent of all U.S. streams, according to Comscore. Toppling it would require massive amounts of effort, an undertaking even a company like Amazon can't achieve for now, and it has Jeff Bezos.It would also be interesting to see how Walmart plans to differentiate itself from the rest of the pack. Since Netflix, Amazon, and Hulu offer all kinds of viewing pleasures, Walmart could make its video streaming service a niche option, much like how Shudder is all about horror films. That will greatly limit its potential audience, however.Would you subscribe to Walmart's streaming service? What do you think about this trend of companies launching their respective video platforms?

{"content": "July 26--SAN FRANCISCO -- The charge PG&amp;E took in the second quarter alone for Northern California wildfire-related costs nearly equaled the company's $1.6 million penalty in 2015 for a natural gas explosion that killed eight and wrecked a San Bruno neighborhood in 2010. That was the largest regulatory punishment ever imposed on a U.S. utility, and the company was later found guilty of crimes it committed before and after that explosion, a verdict that branded PG&amp;E a convicted felon.Despite the net loss on the company's bottom line, PG&amp;E's shares soared about 4 percent and closed at $44.70 after it posted profits from operations of $1.16 a share, which topped Wall Street's forecast of 95 cents.PG&amp;E has waged a campaign to change the state's legal framework for determining whether utilities and their shareholders -- or the companies' rate-paying customers -- ultimately pay for costs associated with wildfires sparked by the utilities' infrastructure. A state legislative conference committee is considering various proposals from Gov. Jerry Brown and lawmakers, but PG&amp;E on Thursday labeled the governor's plan as \"insufficient.\" Brown's proposal would ease utilities' future potential wildfire-related liabilities, but wouldn't apply to costs for the October 2017 wildfires.San Francisco-based PG&amp;E told analysts during the conference call that it may have to slash spending on maintenance, equipment and clean energy, unless it receives favorable outcomes from legislative proposals the utility supports in Sacramento. PG&amp;E also said insurance premiums and its costs have jumped in the aftermath of the wildfires.Gov. Brown's plan, if adopted, could dramatically ease the potential wildfire-related financial burdens on large utilities such as PG&amp;E -- and potentially shovel more costs onto ratepayers' shoulders.\"The governor's proposal is constructive, but it is insufficient,\" said Geisha Williams, PG&amp;E's chief executive officer, during a conference call \"It is an important input, but more work is necessary. The time for action is now.\"Other proposals include altering the use of a legal principle known as inverse condemnation, which holds utilities strictly liable if their equipment was a factor in starting a wildfire, even if the utility properly conducted maintenance and facilities upgrades; efforts to ease the financial burden from liabilities PG&amp;E faces for the October 2017 fires; and a move to reduce potential costs from future wildfires.Excluding the one-time costs associated with the October wildfires, PG&amp;E would have earned $601 million from its operations in the three-month period that ended in June. Operating profits were 36.6 percent higher than in the second quarter of last year.The utility's equipment and facilities were determined by state fire investigators to have caused 16 wildfires last fall, including 12 of the October wildfires in Northern California.Of the 16 fire incidents, state investigators alleged that the company violated the law in 11 blazes in 2017.If PG&amp;E succeeds in , its effort to get the state to change how liabilities are assigned and paid, it could pass wildfire costs on to its customers.That effort has prompted opposition, however, from insurance companies.\"The insurance industry is saying hold your horses in terms of getting rid of inverse condemnation,\" said Paul Patterson, an analyst with Glenrock Equities. \"A whole ecosystem related to inverse condemnation has been built up over the decades that may be tough to change in a month.\"PG&amp;E said it must navigate an increasingly challenging landscape for insurance coverage in the wake of the fires.\"Some carriers have significantly reduced their exposure by reducing limits or excluding events that were previously covered, and all have significantly increased their premiums,\" said Jason Wells, PG&amp;E's chief financial officer, during the conference call. \"We are seeking to transfer approximately $1 billion to $1.5 billion of financial risk to the insurance and capital markets.\"The cost of this new insurance coverage is expected to be $350 million. At present, PG&amp;E customers are covering, through a portion of their monthly bills, $50 million in costs for wildfire-related coverage.That means higher monthly bills loom over customers just to cover higher insurance costs.Legislative proposals under discussion in Sacramento include wildfire safety and prevention, forcing utilities to upgrade their aging electricity systems, vegetation control, changing how liability for wildfires is assigned, using a bond measure to ease PG&amp;E's financial exposure to the October 2017 fires, and creating a path to alleviate cost burdens from future wildfires.PG&amp;E warned it might have to chop capital spending if the Legislature fails to adopt wide-ranging reforms that are to the utility's liking. It also raised the specter of higher monthly gas and electricity bills for customers.\"We will never sacrifice safety-driven work, but as long as these flawed policies remain in place, we must carefully evaluate whether we can support our current level of capital expenditures,\" Williams said.PG&amp;E appears to be under intense pressure, said state Sen. Jerry Hill, a frequent critic of PG&amp;E whose legislative district includes San Bruno.\"We are hearing a level of desperation from PG&amp;E leadership,\" Hill said. \"They know they are responsible for much of the fire damage and they desperately need to change the liability laws. PG&amp;E won't rest until it changes the laws it keeps breaking.\"___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "664"}

{"content": "Welcome back. Bitcoin staged a comeback in July on the wings of an unexpected buy-the-dip surge, optimistic market sentiment and anticipation of the first bitcoin exchange-traded fund by year-end. Cryptocurrency markets suffered steep losses in the first half of the year. Bitcoin prices dropped by more than 53% and the overall market cap of cryptocurrencies declined by as much as 59% in the same period. However, there's a noticeable uptrend in the price of Bitcoin, other altcoins, and the general cryptocurrency market as bulls start to reassert their control over the market. Bitcoin is now trading up around $8,230. One-time hedge fund billionaire Mike Novogratz is one of the most vocal evangelists of cryptocurrencies. In a recent interview with The Street he noted that institutional investors are slowly coming to the realization that blockchain is the future of the global economy. In his words:  \"Their first way of participating is going to be through venture-capital funds... The second step for them will be buying the coins and/or the ICOs themselves, but many of them are participating in the ICOs already through their venture investments.\"  It doesn't take much digging to uncover why Novogratz is optimistic about the prospects of cryptocurrencies. Novogratz -- who posted losses on an ill-timed bet on Brazilian assets and a Swiss franc vs. euro currency trade -- has regained a decent part of his fortune on an Ether bet that netted him $250 million in 2017. One of the key drivers of the recent uptrend in Bitcoin is a sudden inflow of funds. The daily trading volume of digital assets has seen a consistent uptrend in the last couple of weeks. Outside of existing market makers, we might see institutional investors inching closer to cryptocurrencies in the remaining months of 2018. The increasing interest of organizations could dramatically alter the global significance of crypto assets by year-end. Goldman Sachs launched a cryptocurrency trading desk and Intercontinental Exchange Inc., (ICE) , the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, plans to provide a cryptocurrency data feed in a partnership with Blockstream and publicly hinted at the possibility of launching a crypto futures desk of its own.  The return of Bitcoin to its bullish ways has also triggered an increase in positive market sentiment for cryptocurrencies. The activity on Twitter, Facebook, and cryptocurrency-specific social trading site, eToro, suggest many of the casual speculators who bought the cryptocurrency at the height of its bull run last year exited the markets in the bear market in the first half of 2018. Now that most of the fickle Bitcoin investors have exited the markets, bulls are confident that Bitcoin can now enjoy a steady bull run backed by a large base of committed long-term investors.  Yossi Dayan, head of digital assets at wealth management firm Altshuler Shaham, observes that \"a lot of the weaker hands that bought into BTC earlier in the year have been taken out, which is allowing for some good price action. This can continue. There is also some excitement regarding a potential ETF approval from the SEC. It might be somewhat premature considering the cautious stance the SEC has taken so far regarding crypto. An approval carries significant implications and it's not something the U.S. regulator is rushing into.\" However, while cryptocurrencies appear to be gearing up for another bull run, Eterbank.com, a provider of cryptocurrency point of sales for retail and other \"real world\" uses, has pointed out that mass adoption of cryptocurrency will be difficult until people can use it to buy ordinary goods like a cup of coffee. Their solution, along with crypto-to-fiat apps Dether and Abra, provide point-of-sale mobile apps that accept cryptocurrency with the help of instant crypto-to-fiat conversion technology. The instant conversion to U.S. dollars, yen, won, or euros eliminates the risk of changing valuation after purchase -- one of the chief complaints about Ethereum and EOS, upon which many applications are built.", "id": "668"}

First Jared Cook introduced the story to reporters Monday before Gruden defended his choice to show Barry Sanders and Joe Montana and Jack Tatum on Wednesday.For the Raiders' starting quarterback, whatever film helps the team get better sits fine with him.\"If it's the same coverage as people are playing today and it's the same route that we're trying to install, you get a whole bunch of benefit seeing somebody else do it,\" Carr said. \"You get a different taste of how someone would release or how someone would break or the timing of the quarterback, the kind of drops they would take, all those different things. If it helps makes us better, then it's awesome.\"That time Gruden bought beer for his Pro BowlersPeyton Manning played under Gruden in the 2001 Pro Bowl, and their relationship has spanned almost two decades. Manning came to Thursday's practice as Gruden's guest, and the future Hall of Famer had a funny story to tell about Oakland's new head coach.Asked if he sees the same Gruden now as the one who coached him at the start of the century in Hawaii, Manning chuckled.Apparently Gruden had an interesting tactic to draw players to him, an aura that clearly still exists today, though maybe not for the same reason.\"Back then it was a little more intense and serious,\" Manning said of the Pro Bowl. \"But that week guys wanted to run through a wall just for him as our Pro Bowl coach, partially because he bought all the beer for all the players, which was smart. I think it helped him in free agency a few years later.\"Kicking competition going back and forthA day after Giorgio Tavecchio made 4-of-6 field goals with a make from his deepest attempt (51 yards), Eddy Pi\u00f1eiro went 4-of-6 with a final make from 51 yards.Kickers have been alternating days so as to not wear out Tavecchio's left leg or Pi\u00f1eiro's right.Although from my raw eyes it seems Pi\u00f1eiro has a slight edge in the kicking competition, Gruden has said no true evaluations can be made until preseason games. Pi\u00f1eiro, of course, has what would seem to be an advantage with his college holder Johnny Townsend doing the same in the NFL. We'll see if Tavecchio can overcome that connection and hold onto his starting job in 2018.Day 6 injury reportOUT: LT Donald Penn (foot), DT Eddie Vanderdoes (ACL), CB Gareon Conley (hip), OT Brandon Parker (undisclosed)IN: RB Jalen Richard, TE Derek Carrier, DE Fadol Brown, WR Martavis BryantStarting right guard Gabe Jackson left practice early, and Denver Kirkland stepped in with the first team at right guard.

{"content": "July 30--Reliever Jesse Chavez returns Tuesday to PNC Park, where his 11-year major-league career began with a perfect inning of relief against the Cubs. Chavez's nine-team odyssey included one curious trade-deadline detour eight years ago.\"I was walking from the visitors clubhouse to the bullpen in Cincinnati,\" recalled Chavez, believing at the time he would stay with the Braves with the deadline minutes away. \"I was literally behind home plate as the umpires were convening (to exchange lineup cards).\"Then I was called back and told I was traded to the Royals.\"But Chavez won't need to worry about a similar occurrence this season after making a favorable impression in the short time he has been with the Cubs since arriving from the Rangers in a trade July 19.\"He knows what he's doing,\" manager Joe Maddon said Saturday after Chavez had his fifth consecutive scoreless outing.\"He's very resilient. He's an interesting add.\"Chavez immediately established his value: He pitched two scoreless innings to preserve a 7-2 victory July 21 in his Cubs debut, and he pitched a scoreless sixth that allowed the Cubs to rally from a 6-1 deficit to a 7-6 walk-off triumph Thursday over the Diamondbacks.\"He has a slow heartbeat,\" said Cubs special assistant David Ross, who played with Chavez with the Braves in 2010. \"He leads by example. He knows how to pitch and have a good time.\"Right fielder Jason Heyward, who was a rookie when he played with Ross and Chavez, added that Chavez has \"withstood the test of time.\"\"He's a guy who started, relieved, started and now relieved,\" Heyward said. \"To me, that embodies how he can figure how to help a team win in any role.\"In the last eight seasons, Chavez has persevered by pitching aggressively, staying healthy and polishing four pitches -- particularly a changeup -- that more than compensated for lacking a blazing fastball.Although his recent trade surprised him, Chavez was pleased he was dealt well in advance of Tuesday's deadline.\"I've been on teams that have been on the fire sale side, and I think it's beneficial to get it out of the way for a player to get (to his new team) get to know the team, before it gets to crush time,\" Chavez said.\"The earlier you get to a new team, the better the acclimation you can make to the club -- from the catchers, scouting staff, pitching coaches, the manager. It goes down the line from the players to the clubhouse guys, getting them comfortable with you. They want you to be comfortable.\"With all the moving Chavez has experienced, providing support for his family is just as essential. His family accompanied him from Texas after the trade and will stay with him through next weekend's home series before they return to Riverside, Calif.Chavez's daughter Christe will start freshman orientation next week at Riverside Poly High School.But Chavez, who turns 35 on Aug. 21, has no intention of retiring, especially with his continued effectiveness and his services in demand.\"As long as I'm healthy, I do all I can to stay out of that trainer's room,\" said Chavez, who has pitched in 338 games, including 70 starts. \"As long as I can do that, I don't see why I should hang (it) up.

{"content": "Let Buffett guide you into a play on autos. Credit Acceptance Corporation (CACC) offers financing programs that enable automobile dealers to sell vehicles to consumers. Its financing programs are offered through a network of automobile dealers. The company has two dealer financing programs. The Portfolio Program advances money to dealers in exchange for the right to service the underlying consumer loans while under the Purchase Program, the company buys the consumer loans from the dealers and keeps the amounts collected from the consumer. A bedrock principle for Warren Buffett is that his type of company has a \"durable competitive advantage\" as compared to being a \"price competitive\" or \"commodity\" type of business. Buffett likes companies to have solid, stable earnings that are continually expanding. This allows him to accurately predict future earnings. Buffett would consider this firm's earnings predictable.  In fact earnings per share for Credit Acceptance have increased every year. The company's long term historical earnings per share growth rate is 30.3%, based on the average of the 3, 4 and 5 year historical earnings per share growth rates. The company is expected to grow earnings 16.0% per year in the future, based on the analysts' consensus estimated long term growth rate. The Buffett Checklist Buffett likes companies with above average return on equity of at least 15% or better, as this is an indicator that the company has a durable competitive advantage. U.S. corporations have, on average, returned about 12% on equity over the last 30 years. The average ROE for Credit Acceptance, over the last ten years, is 31.1%, which is high enough to pass. Buffett also requires, for financial companies, that the average Return On Assets (ROA) be at least 1% and consistent. Return On Assets is defined as the net earnings of the business divided by the total assets of the business. The average ROA for Credit Acceptance, over the last ten years, is 9.6%, which is high enough to pass.  Buffett likes companies that do not have major capital expenditures. Credit Acceptance's free cash flow per share of $28.51 is positive, indicating that the company is generating more cash that it is consuming. This is a favorable sign, and so the company passes this criterion. Buffett also likes to see if management has spent retained earnings in a way that benefits shareholders. To figure this out, Buffett takes the total amount of retained earnings over the previous ten years of $110.28 and compares it to the gain in earnings per share over the same period of $26.98. Credit Acceptance's management has proven it can earn shareholders a 24.5% return on the earnings they kept. This return is more than acceptable to Buffett. Essentially, management is doing a great job putting the retained earnings to work. Why to Buy The second stage of Buffett's analysis asks \"Should I buy at this price?\" The Buffett strategy favors companies in which the initial rate of return is around the long-term treasury yield. Currently, the long-term treasury yield is about 2.75%. Compare this with Credit Acceptance's initial yield of 8.03%, which will expand at an annual rate of 16.0%, based on the analysts' consensus estimated long term growth rate. The company is the better choice, as the initial rate of return is close to or above the long term bond yield and is expanding. The Buffett-style strategy calculates the expected rate of return based on the average return on equity method and also based on average earnings per share growth. Based on the two different methods, you could expect an annual compounding rate of return somewhere between 16.0% and 29.2%. To pinpoint the average return a little better, we have taken an average of the two different methods. Investors could expect an average return of 22.6% on Credit Acceptance shares for the next ten years, based on the current fundamentals. Buffett would consider this an exceptional return, thus passing the criterion. By: John Reese of Validea. Via MoneyShow.", "id": "671"}
{"content": "DANBURY \u2014 Residents can now buy recycled paint for the first time in Connecticut \u2014 but they\u2019ll have to travel to Danbury to get it.  The new paint is created by MXI Environmental Services using paint collected in Connecticut. The Habitat for Humanity ReStore in Danbury is currently the only place where the paint can be purchased in the state.  \u201cThese are the types of stewardship programs we need more of and Connecticut has been a leader of that,\u201d said Rob Klee, commissioner of the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection.  The recycled paint stems from a law that was passed in 2011 and established a paint stewardship program two years later. Under that program, 72 cents was added to every gallon of paint sold that then allowed unwanted and leftover paint to be recycled for free at 146 collection points across the state. Most of these sites are at paint and hardware stores.                              Paint is also collected at local household hazardous waste events. That\u2019s where the paint MXI Environmental Services, the contracted household hazardous waste vendor for western Connecticut, collected its paint for the new product.  Nearly 17,000 gallons of paint were collected at household hazardous waste events the Housatonic Resources Recovery Authority held last year, said Jennifer Heaton-Jones, the authority\u2019s executive director. The authority covers 11 towns in the Danbury area.  She credited state Sen. Craig Miner for his work in helping the first legislation pass. Miner also unsuccessfully introduced a bill that would require paint sold in Connecticut be made with recycled product.    \u201cMy thought was when I bring a can to be recycled, I hope it can return in some fashion that we can reuse,\u201d said Miner, whose district includes New Milford and Kent. \u201cUntil now, that was only a thought.\u201d  MXI, which is based in Virginia, collects the paint and separates it by color and base. It is then re-blended and made into the new paint. The wall paint, Full Circle, is made of 99 percent recycled material and Old Man Potter, the furniture chalk paint, is made of more than 95 percent recycled material.  So far, the company has a gray and a tan option available for wall paint because that is the highest volume of paint collected. It also has three colors for the furniture chalk paint. More colors are expected for both, said Craig Potter, MXI\u2019s vice president.  Potter said he likes how the furniture paint can be used to help reuse other items, such as furniture. He had an end table he picked up on the side of the road that he re-painted and distressed on display.  \u201cOld Man Potter isn\u2019t only recycled itself, but it can take something most people consider junk and turn it into a shabby chic item,\u201d he said.  So far, the MXI paint is only sold stateside in Connecticut and Raleigh, N.C. They have 1,000 gallons of each color already prepared.  This recycled paint is seen as a necessary way to close the recycling loop, by reusing materials and not have to take them out of the ground to make more paint.  \u201cThis is very important,\u201d Heaton-Jones said.  Several officials applauded the partnership with Habitat for Humanity, which focuses on reusing materials as well, at an event held Friday to unveil the product.  John Gonski, a member of the Housatonic Habitat for Humanity Board of Directors, said the sale of the paint at the store will help fund its building projects, its brush with kindness program and administrative costs.  Klee said he would like to see the sale of recycled paint expand and saw the partnership with Habitat for Humanity as a possible way to do that. He said both programs\u2019 missions are similar. Every little thing people do to help the planet adds up, whether it\u2019s recycling, composting or using electric vehicles, he added.  \u201cThe decisions we\u2019re making now and the things we\u2019re doing for the planet now have that inter-generational impact,\u201d he said.  kkoerting@newstimes.com; 203-731-3345", "id": "672"}
{"content": "Aug. 02--Two key dates in the annals of Winnie-the-Pooh:Dec. 24, 1925: A.A. Milne publishes a front-page children's story in the London Evening News, changing the name of his nascent bear character (formerly Edward) to Winnie-the-Pooh. The bear is inspired by his son, Christopher Robin Milne, his stuffed teddy, and the Ashdown Forest near Milne's residence in East Sussex, England. The name Winnie came from a famous bear housed in the London zoo.Aug. 3, 2018: Disney, the commercial proprietor of Milne's characters since 1961, releases its latest brand extension, \"Christopher Robin,\" combining live-action and discreet digital animation. The story concerns a middle-age and beleaguered Christopher Robin, played by Ewan McGregor, a World War II combat veteran employed postwar as an efficiency expert at a struggling London luggage company. He has a wife (Hayley Atwell) and a daughter (Bronte Carmichael) he loves but neglects; he is, in other words, suffering from Mr. Banks Syndrome, named after the character in \"Mary Poppins.\" Faced with the grim prospect of downsizing his staff, Christopher Robin has all but forgotten his childhood playmates Pooh, Eeyore, Piglet, Tigger, Kanga, Roo, et al.Then, popping through a magic portal in his tree-trunk home, Pooh magically appears in London to reacquaint himself with his sad old friend. After Christopher Robin's initial shock, increasing exasperation and, back at the Hundred Acre Wood, another separation, all of which proved quite upsetting to this critic's 8-year-old stepson, the film lands on a mossy bed of warm feeling and humane work/life balance.The movie's also unabashedly pro-labor and anti-layoff.In between 1925 and 2018, so much else has happened with Pooh, the Hundred Acre Wood, the Heffalump and other Milne delights, in so many different incarnations.I came to \"Christopher Robin\" an ardent fan of both the Milne stories, graced with E.H. Shepard's illustrations, and the Disney shorts begun in 1966. The new film is directed by Marc Forster, of \"Finding Neverland,\" and it comes from a curious and talented collection of screenwriters and rewriters, beginning with Alex Ross Perry, best known for the fantastically jaundiced comedies \"The Color Wheel\" and \"Listen Up Philip\"; Tom McCarthy, who scored with \"The Visitor\" and as one of the writers of \"Spotlight\"; and finally Allison Schroeder, co-adapter of \"Hidden Figures.\"And the results? Quite good, it turns out. Forster has his strident, pushy side (\"The Kite Runner,\" \"Quantum of Solace\") and he has absolutely no sense of directorial or visual humor. None. Not a speck. But he made some shrewd key decisions on this project, starting with how to blend the two worlds, London and the Hundred Acre Wood, and the live action with the digitally realized lives of the wee stuffed creatures who are, in fact, real: walking, talking, bouncing, caring animals.Storywise we're very much in \"Hook\" territory, in addition to \"Finding Neverland\" territory. The grown-up Christopher Robin has become a drudge and a slave to the dollar, the way the grown-up Peter Pan in \"Hook\" forgets his old life and comrades en route to conventional notions of success. \"Christopher Robin\" does a better job of justifying that story decision. The McGregor character isn't simply self-absorbed and emotionally distant; he's trying to save his colleagues' jobs while cutting expenses on order from above. Once Forster and his design team get McGregor back to the Hundred Acre Wood, and in the bosom of his dear childhood friends, \"Christopher Robin\" finds its way. The interplay between humans and stuffed-but-very-lively animals is lovely. The voice work from Jim Cummings (Pooh, sweet and sincere as you please), Brad Garrett (a wittily morose Eeyore), Peter Capaldi (Rabbit), Toby Jones (Owl) and the rest holds to a high standard.Movies about saying goodbye to childhood friends, and finding them again, work on our emotional defenses like nothing else. (I know people who started crying at \"Toy Story 3\" on the way into the theater.) Unusually for director Forster, \"Christopher Robin\" doesn't go for the throat, or the jugular; though the editing is antsy and a little off. McGregor and Atwell play their scenes for real. The core human/bear connection is treated with respect. Pooh's wisdom and kindness cannot be denied. The same impulses worked for the two \"Paddington\" movies, God knows. \"Christopher Robin\" isn't quite in their league, but it's affecting nonetheless.Michael Phillips is a Tribune critic.mjphillips@chicagotribune.com\"Christopher Robin\" -- 3 starsMPAA rating: PG (for some action)Running time: 1:44Opens: Friday___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "673"}

Don't sail too high or sink too low. Learn to be good at handling failure. Be the first one to the ballpark. Be the last one to leave. Work hard, don't complain, be a great teammate.\"Ask other people about themselves. You never know what you might learn. And above all, treat people with respect. The best compliment any baseball player can receive is that he is a good teammate. It's the reflection of all the things not listed on the back of the baseball card. It's the focus, the attitude, the openness and the way an individual picks you up on Monday but will call you out on Tuesday. In short, it's about accountability, reliability and commitment.\"Baseball is all about family, and I'm so glad to celebrate this great day with (those) closest to me.\"Thome spent most of his 22-year career in Cleveland and then Philadelphia but said he came \"home to Illinois\" with the White Sox after his mother died.\"I can't help but think that she was watching over us all and that maybe she helped bring us back to Illinois to be closer to Dad and the rest of our family,\" he said. \"I'm still fortunate to continue to work now for the White Sox alongside general manager Rick Hahn, President Kenny Williams, and working for the best boss in the world, my good friend and mentor, Jerry Reinsdorf. It's been a thrill to have the opportunity to see the game from the other side.\"Hand of GodChipper Jones mentioned Thome during his induction speech, telling a story of their first meeting in 1993 at a Triple-A game in Richmond, Va. After Ryan Klesko homered for the Richmond Braves, the Charlotte closer threw a pitch behind him in his next at-bat.\"Here we go, nice little donnybrook there at the diamond in Richmond,\" Jones said. \"So I go diving into the pile. Next thing I know, what can only be described as the hand of God grabs me around the throat, pins me up to the backstop netting. All can hear is, 'Don't move.'\"So thinking God had me around the neck, naturally, I obliged. I did manage to glance up and see my mother and father in the third row, Mom's eyes about this big. J.T. whispered in my ear. He said, 'You done?' I said, 'Yes, sir, I'm done.' \"The two have remained friends ever since.Hamels watchCole Hamels' Cubs debut at Wrigley Field won't be until the Nationals series Aug. 10-12, so he'll have a couple of starts under his belt to get acclimated.Starting Hamels on Wednesday in Pittsburgh means he can't start the finale of the Padres series Sunday at Wrigley. Had he started Tuesday, he would've bumped Jon Lester. So Hamels presumably will make his second start Aug. 6 in Kansas City, assuming Joe Maddon keeps the rotation in order. And with an off day Aug. 9, he'd be on track to make his Wrigley debut in the nationally televised Sunday night game Aug. 12.Maddon's plans have to be written with an Etch A Sketch from here on out, but the way it looks now, Hamels could go Aug. 18 in Pittsburgh, Aug. 24 against the Reds at Wrigley and Aug. 29 against the Mets at Wrigley. By that point we should have some clarification on whether Yu Darvish will be back for the final month.No matter when Hamels makes his first Wrigley start, he's going to have a difficult time matching his last one. Hamels was facing rookie Kris Bryant with a chance to throw the first no-hitter against the Cubs in 50 years when Bryant hit a shot to center that appeared to be leaving the yard. Instead the wind kept it in, and center fielder Odubel Herrera drifted back, moved in, lost his footing and made a diving catch on the warning track to preserve the no-no.\"A surreal moment,\" Hamels said afterward.It was the first time the Cubs had been no-hit in 7,920 games since Sept. 9, 1965, when Sandy Koufax threw a perfect game against them at Dodger Stadium.Newcomb apologyBraves pitcher Sean Newcomb came within one strike of throwing a no-hitter against the Dodgers on Sunday, then learned some racist, sexist and homophobic tweets from him several years ago had been unearthed.Newcomb, 25, apologized for \"any insensitive material\" he wrote, adding: \"It was a long time ago, six or seven years ago, saying some stupid stuff with friends. I know I've grown a lot since then. I didn't mean anything by it.\"Newcomb is the second player this month to apologize for inappropriate tweets from his younger days, after the Brewers' Josh Hader saw old tweets get dug up during the All-Star Game on July 17.Wasted opportunityThe Nationals split a four-game series with the Marlins, leaving them under .500 again at 52-53, the latest they've been under .500 in a season since 2015.Adam Eaton said the Nats didn't have a \"sense of urgency\" against the Marlins.\"We need to win three out of four from that team, or take all four if we can,\" he told the Washington Post. \"Same thing with Milwaukee (in the previous series).

{"content": "July 31--Ride-sharing giant Uber is winding down its self-driving truck technology business, better known as Otto, which Uber acquired in 2016 for $680 million.Officially, Uber had previously retired the Otto name and folded that company's tech and workers into its Advanced Technologies Group, but the Otto moniker remained in the public consciousness.Now, however, it's exiting the self-driving truck technology business altogether.Uber said the decision to exit self-driving trucks will have no effect on Uber Freight, its business that connects trucking companies with drivers to haul cargo across the country. The company also said it has no plans to exit the market for self-driving car technology.\"We've decided to stop development on our self-driving truck program and move forward exclusively with cars,\" said Eric Meyhofer, head of Uber's Advanced Technologies Group, in a statement provided by the company. \"We recently took the important step of returning to public roads in Pittsburgh, and as we look to continue that momentum, we believe having our entire team's energy and expertise focused on this effort is the best path forward.\"Meyerhof was referring to Uber getting back into testing self-driving cars on public roads after it suspended such operations across North America following an accident earlier this year, when an Uber self-driving car struck and killed a female pedestrian in Tempe, Arizona. That car had a driving assistant in the front passenger seat, and the accident called into question the viability of self-driving cars on public streets.Uber's self-driving truck business was probably known more for being in the courtroom rather than on the nation's highways. Otto founder Anthony Levandowski previously worked for Waymo, the self-driving car business owned by Google parent Alphabet. Not long after acquiring Otto, Waymo sued Uber for stealing trade secrets, and accused Levandowski of stealing 14,000 files before he left Waymo.In February of this year, Waymo and Uber settled the case, with Waymo acquiring a $245 million stake in Uber and Uber pledging to not use any Waymo technology in its self-driving car efforts.Uber said that employees affected by the self-driving truck operations shutdown will be offered the opportunity to move into other self-driving technology efforts at the company.___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "675"}
{"content": "July 31--The recent closing of Kingsbury Street Cafe was largely unheralded, but for those who knew better, it marked the end of a distinguished career of a chef who influenced and changed Chicago's baking and pastry scene, ultimately changing how we eat today.I met Hoa Tuy Dong in 1980, after she opened Work of Art, a bakery on North Lincoln Avenue that was reinventing sweets, pushing back against dry layer cakes loaded with too much kirshwasser and buttercream. I had baked my own first cake at age 37 in an effort to build a surprise birthday cake delivery service. Figuring out how to bake was a challenge, but trying to decorate cakes was impossible. I read in the Chicago Tribune that Work of Art was offering cake decorating classes; I signed up.My first vision of Hoa was exotic: I remember her dressed in a long grey dress that had free flowing panels, front and back. Her hair was long and black and tied in the old-fashioned Gibson Girl style, soft and poofy with a bun on top.On the wall behind the counter hung framed photographs of elaborate, breathtakingly gorgeous wedding cakes, alongside proclamations of awards she had collected.In the class, I was a miserable failure. I learned a few border designs, but never mastered the flowers.I called Hoa whenever I needed real butter cookies, sweet rolls, fruit galettes and croissants for myself.Then came a devastating fire that destroyed Work of Art. Her spirit prevailed, though, and she reopened on West Diversey, not far from the storefront I turned into a kitchen. We helped each other whenever the call came -- whether it was about ingredients, equipment, deliveries, advice or simply caring.Hoa moved again, to Halsted near Division, because she needed a huge production kitchen when she took on all the croissants for Starbucks Midwest. That was right after Margaret Sheridan called from the Tribune to say, \"Get ready. You were named the best croissant in Chicago!\"When she got the Starbucks contract, Hoa didn't have a sheeter -- the machine that literally sheets the dough so it can be cut, which she did by hand. So she went to an equipment vendor, explained what she needed and why, and he gave her the sheeter that day and let her pay it off over time.I could identify with that. I, too, had worked with kind and understanding vendors who had \"seen it all,\" in the words of one produce man, and knew we could be trusted to pay. Hoa and I shared stories of those fourth- and fifth-generation vendors who saved our businesses and, in essence, our lives.Each day, Hoa delivered 3,000 croissants a day, shipped on pallets to a central distribution center. And if the driver didn't show up, a family member drove the truck.Then Starbucks wanted doughnuts, so she made doughnuts.Hoa also was supplying food and baked goods to a small specialty store in the West Loop, called Cyd and DePano's. Several people from Oprah Winfrey's Harpo Productions ate there and recommended Hoa to make the food for the studio's 400 employees.With the new work, Hoa was able to stop the Starbucks madness after five years. From 2006 until Harpo Productions left Chicago, she supplied the company's cafeteria.Hoa's voice softens when she speaks of that time, because her father had arrived in Chicago by then, got very sick and died, leaving her with enormous hospital bills. She dabs her eyes and says, \"I wish I could thank Miss Winfrey for the Harpo contract, because that's what paid those bills.\"Hoa Tuy Dong, her sisters and daughters had come to the United States after leaving Vietnam in 1975 on one of the last ships out after the war. They went first to a refugee camp in Guam and then to New York City.One of her memories is striking: She grew up in Saigon and knew that her parents, who were both good students, went to France as part of their education. She doesn't know the details of their time there, and like so many of us who never asked the elders for their stories, merely accepted that part of their family meals was kugel and challah. \"I never had a recipe for challah,\" she said, \"I just remember how it felt and tasted.\" Now she thinks that her mother might have lived with, or worked for, a Jewish family.Her mother was a wonderful cook, and Hoa loved to bake. When Hoa arrived in New York, she taught herself to make and decorate cakes. The Wilton company offered her a job designing cakes for the Wilton Celebration books and moved her to their headquarters in Chicago.When she felt ready, Hoa opened Work of Art.Her last stop was opening the Kingsbury Street Cafe in 2011, while maintaining Work of Art Bakery as part of it, across from the Lincoln Park Whole Foods. It was a beautiful space with delicious food and baked goods. I went regularly after my own restaurant, Ina's, closed.I went to see Hoa on the last day, Friday, May 25, understanding what goes into a decision to close, and was able to sit and listen to her talk. Her words were the same ones I'd spoken when I made that same decision.She said, \"The business is harder. The staff doesn't care enough, and I worked so hard to earn a good reputation.\" She also added, \"The body tells you when it's time.\"Hoa was a relatively unknown chef who gave so much to Chicago, via Wilton, Starbucks, Harpo and her shops and restaurant, and I can only hope she received what she needed and deserved in return.For years she has sent funds to care for children in Vietnam and will now make her home in the mountains between Saigon and Da Nang. She'll spend her time watching over a garden and those children.To my friend Hoa: I love and respect you, and will think of you happy in those mountains. Never forget how much change you were a part of and how many people you made happy.Ina Pinkney, aka The Breakfast Queen, owned iconic West Loop breakfast spot Ina's for more than 30 years and now writes \"Breakfast with Ina\" monthly for Food &amp; Dining.___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "676"}

{"content": "Group video and voice calls are now possible in WhatsApp. The company says the feature is rolling out now, and like every interaction in the app, it\u2019s going to have end-to-end encryption. ( Alfredo Rivera | Pixabay )This past May at the Facebook F8 developer conference, WhatsApp confirmed that it would be rolling out voice and video group calling later this year. Fast forward to now \u2014 the company says those features are finally live.Video and voice calling for groups are now available for all WhatsApp users across the globe, be it on Android or iOS. The feature supports calls with up to four people simultaneously, no matter where those people might be.Moreover, WhatsApp says it has applied some fancy-schmancy engineering to make the feature work even under shoddy internet connections. Also, as with everything that's done within WhatsApp, group calls are protected with end-to-end encryption, meaning no other part will be privy to users' conversation except the participants.\"Over the last couple years, people have enjoyed making voice and video calls on WhatsApp. In fact, our users spend over 2 billion minutes on calls per day,\" the Facebook-owned company announced in a blog post.How To Start Group Calls In WhatsAppTo make group calls, simply start a one-on-one voice or video calls and tap the new \"add participant\" button located in the top right corner to add more friends to the conversation.Compared with FaceTime, WhatsApp's video calling feature is a tad bit limited \u2014 Apple's video conferencing platform is poised to get group calling this fall, and it'll be able to support up to 32 participants in just one session, a far cry from WhatsApp's four. However, it's not every day that a user needs to talk to that many people, so four would probably be just fine.What This Means For WhatsAppIn any case, the addition gives WhatsApp an answer to rivals who have long offered multi-user video calls, such as Skype. It's long overdue, too \u2014 WhatsApp now boasts nearly 2 billion monthly users, and them not being able to engage in group voice and video calls seems very neanderthal. Many of those users treat WhatsApp as their primary messaging platform, too, be it for personal or work reasons, so not having the feature probably impacts their productivity greatly.Adding the feature also seems part of a strategy that's becoming more apparent not just with Facebook, but other major Silicon Valley companies as well. Google, for starters, recently updated Search to show improved results for nearby events, which means people might be less likely to open other apps for, say, checking out upcoming concerts in the neighborhood. While WhatsApp is far from attaining WeChat-levels of multipurpose function, it's clear it wants to get to that point, albeit slowly.", "id": "679"}

Not only did it meet expectations, but it exceeded them too \u2014 and things are only likely to get better for Apple as it heads into another iPhone refresh cycle.Generally speaking, the quarter ending June 30 is the slowest for Apple, at least when it comes to sales of the iPhone and Apple Watch. It\u2019s right at the end of an iPhone\u2019s lifetime \u2014 and right before a new set of iPhones take over. This year, however, Apple posted its strongest ever third-quarter earnings, beating expectations.Apple also said during its earnings call that it expected revenue next quarter to be between $60 billion and $62 billion, which is again ahead of expectations from Wall Street \u2014 which come in at $59.47 billion. Meeting that estimate would put represent a hefty 15 percent increase over the same quarter last year.In terms of units, Apple sold about as many iPhones as it did during the same quarter last year \u2014 41.3 million. The difference this quarter, however, is that the average selling price of those iPhones was quite a bit higher, thanks to the more expensive iPhone X, which starts at $1,ooo.Apple is also doing excellent in the wearables market. During the call, the company boasted about 60 percent growth in wearables, a segment that includes the Apple Watch, AirPods, and Beats headphones. It\u2019s likely that segment will continue to grow \u2014 the Apple Watch is growing in popularity and AirPods have become a hit, too.Apple is also growing its \u201cservices\u201d category, which includes things like Apple Music, Apple Pay, Apple Care, iCloud, iTunes, and so on. Apple posted a hefty $9.55 billion in revenue for this category, which is up a hefty 28 percent from the same quarter a year ago. That segment also beat out Wall Street estimates, which came in at $9.21 billion. According to Apple, the boosted revenue is due to high Apple Pay usage, and an increase in paid subscribers through the App Store.\u201cApple Pay continues to expand with well over 1 billion transactions last quarter, triple the amount from just a year ago, with growth accelerating from the March quarter,\u201d said Apple CEO Tim Cook during the earnings call.", "id": "681"}

The Houston Texans have once again set up shop at The Greenbrier in West Virginia. Escaping the Houston heat and humidity and getting away with the team seems to be a phenomenal way for the Texans to start their season.After the first couple of days with no pads, the team got fully suited up on Saturday. This is always an important transition step for teams to take. Skill position players almost always look good without pads and you can\u2019t get a solid read on linemen without them.So far, the early reports are raving about the team chemistry and cohesiveness. The offensive unit is gelling extremely well early on without having to endure another quarterback battle. The defensive unit is full of hype and the clout to back it up.It appears that these players have already fully bought into Houston Texans head coach\u2019s, Bill O\u2019Brien, philosophy and culture. Even though it is early into camp, there is already a small number of mistakes being made.

This method involves a donor anonymously giving her eggs to an infertile patient to help them give birth. But after undergoing the (sometimes tough) decision to have fertility treatment, hopeful-moms-to-be are faced with a second question: \u201cWill my kid look like me?\u201d Ovobank, a pioneering egg bank in Spain, has a high-tech answer to the conundrum \u2014 and it involves using facial recognition to match up patients to similar-looking donors.\u201cIn Spain, where both [in vitro fertilizaation clinic] FIV Marbella and Ovobank are based, egg donation is anonymous, so the patient can\u2019t choose the donor as it is done in some countries,\u201d Dr. Enrique Criado Scholz, general director of the two companies, told Digital Trends. \u201cIt is the medical professionals that have the responsibility of finding a donor that matches the patient\u2019s phenotypic characteristics.\u201dUntil now, this process was achieved by looking at the patient\u2019s phenotypical characteristics \u2014 referring to their height, hair color, eye color, and skin color. The facial matching part was then a subjective decision made based on the doctor\u2019s choices.

Finally, Ovobank will get in contact with the collaboration center, and arrange shipment of the eggs.\u201cThis service is already being rolled out internationally,\u201d Scholz said. \u201cIt is available for download on both Android and iOS platforms.\u201d", "id": "683"}

{"content": "July 31--SAN DIEGO -- With a 54-54 record and a 5.5 game deficit to overcome in the division, the Giants said they were open to buying or selling if the right opportunity presented itself. At the 1 p.m. deadline, that opportunity was nowhere to be found.\"We had a strategy of being strategic buyers and if so inclined and compelling enough, strategic sellers,\" vice president of baseball operations Brian Sabean said. \"But in that context, we wanted to stay clear of free agents-to-be and preferred people that were controllable.\"Though Sabean and general manager Bobby Evans will continue to search for younger players with team-friendly, controllable contracts through the month of August and into the offseason, the Giants' front office was cautious to protect a farm system that lacks depth.As veteran starters Johnny Cueto (right elbow sprain) and Jeff Samardzija (shoulder inflammation) deal with injuries, the Giants indicated they'll continue to scour the market for pitching talent after pursuing opportunities ahead of the non-waiver deadline.\"One, we weren't going to gut the farm system or overpay and two, in a perfect world, which we were trying to pursue, was a controllable situation that would help us in the present and the future,\" Sabean said. \"If it didn't advantage us in that fashion, we backed off.\"The Giants likely gauged interest from other clubs on right fielder Andrew McCutchen, a free agent-to-be, as well as several relief pitchers, but Sabean and Evans didn't want to move assets unless the Giants received meaningful pieces in return. If San Francisco falls completely out of the race in August, that could change, especially because Sabean says the club is motivated to evaluate younger prospects approaching the major league level.Though the Giants didn't complete any deals Tuesday, Evans said the flurry of activity in the hours leading up to the non-waiver deadline may indicate teams will remain motivated to pursue trades in August.\"We're always looking at opportunities after the deadline and we try to stay available and transparent with clubs in terms of opportunities,\" Evans said. \"I think there's been a whole lot more activity around the trade deadline this year than we've seen in years past.\"Several Giants players are expected to be placed on waivers in August, at which point other teams can submit a waiver claim. The Giants can then negotiate a trade with the team that placed the claim, or pull a player back from the waiver wire. If a player goes unclaimed for two days, the Giants would be free to work out trades with any club.If the Giants stay in the hunt in the National League West and or the wildcard race, Evans and Sabean may also look to add to the existing roster. San Francisco was linked to Reds starter Matt Harvey before the deadline, but Cincinnati elected not to trade him. Harvey will likely end up on waivers in August, so if the Giants feel compelled to add a pitcher, there should be more chances to do so.Fewer than 90 minutes before the deadline, Giants manager Bruce Bochy said he's hopeful Giants players take a quiet deadline as a vote of confidence in the current roster and the team's abilities to make a late push.\"That's what you're hoping, we still feel that we're in this and we have a chance to get to where we want to go,\" Bochy said.Because the franchise is determined to remain under the competitive balance tax threshold of $197 million this season, the Giants are unlikely to pursue deals for any two-month rentals or players earning significant salaries in August.Giants rotation undeterminedBochy said the Giants could have a decision regarding how they'll treat Cueto's right elbow sprain within the next day.The Giants manager said Monday Tommy John surgery is a 'strong possibility' after Cueto revealed he's experiencing pain in his elbow after every pitch.With Cueto on the 10-day disabled list and expected to miss an extended period of time, the Giants have listed Madison Bumgarner as their starter for Thursday's game in Arizona and have left the rest of their weekend rotation as \"to be announced.\"If the Giants avoid using right-hander Chris Stratton out of the bullpen Tuesday, Bochy said Stratton will likely start Friday's game against the D'backs.___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "685"}

At the same time, \"when he comes back, you pick your spots.\"Unfortunately for the Cubs and Bryant, two of their days off -- Aug. 9 and Aug. 13 -- will probably occur when Bryant is still recovering.And assuming that Bryant is ready by the time the Cubs start a stretch of 23 games without a day off on Aug. 21, Maddon understands he may need an occasional break.One possible solution would be to use Bryant as the designated hitter during interleague games at Detroit on Aug. 21-22 and against the White Sox at Guaranteed Rate Field on Sept. 21-23.Bryant hasn't played since July 23 due to a recurrence of left shoulder discomfort that sidelined him for 16 games from June 23-July 9.Maddon mentioned that he's already given several players two consecutive days off recently, including Javier Baez and Addison Russell, to not wear down his players entering August.In other medical news, Maddon said Yu Darvish (right triceps) felt fine one day after throwing a 35-pitch bullpen session and will throw another session this weekend.mgonzales@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "686"}
{"content": "Aug. 03--The Los Gatos Town Council will consider a new proposal Tuesday to build 294 condominiums and apartments, a hotel, a town square and retail stores as part of the North 40 development.Developer Grosvenor Americas is seeking to build on just over 15 of the remaining 20 acres that can be developed.The first phase of the North 40 development will see 320 homes built, and more than 66,000-square-feet of commercial and retail development on about 20 acres, and work could start this fall, said Grosvenor Senior Vice President for Development Steve Buster.What will be built in the second phase has yet to be decided.But Buster described the latest proposal as a \"very high level concept.\" His comment came at an Aug. 2 community meeting that was sponsored by the non-partisan Democracy Tent citizens' group.The Phase 2 concept calls for half of the proposed 294 homes to be sized for millennials at about 900-square-feet. The other half would be targeted at downsizing seniors and would be about 1,500-square-feet.A representative of the Town Not City citizens' group, Rod Teague, suggested the senior homes be \"buyer-restricted\" to people over 55 to avoid having \"a bunch of young families\" move in.\"There's a strong need for the 55 demographic in town,\" Teague said. \"I was trying to find a place in Los Gatos for my parents and there was nothing available. They had to move to San Jose.\"Conversely, resident Michael Smith noted that \"a lot of young families would like to come to Los Gatos because of the good schools, but can't afford it.\"Another problem, Smith said, is that sometimes families that already live in Los Gatos can't stay because they can't afford bigger homes for bigger kids.The Democracy Tent held the community meeting to educate residents about what may be coming in Phase 2.\"What we're hoping to do is to make Phase 2 a little less contentious (than Phase 1) and be more collaborative,\" Democracy Tent member Lee Fagot said.Buster repeatedly expressed a willingness to work with the community and said Phase 2 is \"going to look like what you guys want it to look like.\"He went on to say that the Phase 2 housing was proposed as an alternative to \"a big retail and entertainment\" complex because residents don't want the North 40 to compete with downtown Los Gatos businesses.\"We heard that,\" Buster said.He said the developer also heard residents' concerns about traffic and pointed to a study that showed housing would generate 19 percent less traffic than retail and entertainment uses.But there's a caveat: To make the housing and hotel goals financially pencil out, Los Gatos would need to agree to raise the town's maximum 35-foot height limit to 55 feet, Buster said.The town council is already considering allowing a hotel to go to 45 feet.More height would also free up more land for additional open space, perhaps even a multi-purpose field or community garden, Buster said.But that may not satisfy open space proponents.\"I see huge amounts of cement,\" resident Mary Roach said. \"This is a huge cement slab. Where is it for somebody to go outside for a breath of air? Greenery gives us oxygen.\"Buster replied, \"We could figure out a way to make a big park by combining open spaces.\"So, at this point the Phase 2 concept is flexible. It will be discussed in-depth, with time for public comment, during the Aug. 7 Los Gatos Town Council meeting that starts at 7 p.m. at 110 E. Main St.___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "687"}
{"content": "Operators of CERN\u2019s Large Hadron Collider were able to accelerate lead atoms for the first time. The successful experiment could one day lead to new forms of matter, including dark matter. ( Maximilien Brice/Julien Ordan/CERN )The Large Hadron Collider has successfully accelerated its first atoms to breakneck speeds, a feat that could one day lead to new forms of matter.The LHC at the European Center for Nuclear Research at the France-Switzerland border was able to rev up full-blown atoms to nearly the speed of light.Experts say this is the first successful test for CERN's Gamma Factory, a project that aims to find new ways to produce high-energy gamma rays.Large Hadron Collider Accelerates AtomsThe LHC normally generates collisions between protons and then smashes the nuclei for four weeks before the machine is shut down for annual maintenance. This is the first time the atom smasher has accelerated nuclei with at least one electron that orbits them.In a statement, scientists at CERN say they were able to accelerate lead nuclei with one electron, a process that LHC physicist and engineer in charge Michaela Schaumann says is very challenging.Schaumann explains that atoms with only one electron are very delicate. The processes taking place inside the LHC can very easily strip the remaining electron off the nucleus.When this happens, the nucleus crashes into the beam pipe wall because it is not in sync with the particle accelerator's magnetic field anymore.Beam Maintained For Long PeriodsOn the first run, operators placed 24 bunches of atoms into the LHC, achieving a stable, low-energy state for one hour. When switched on to full power, the LHC was able to maintain the beam for two minutes before automatically dumping it.\"If too many particles go off course, the LHC automatically dumps the beam,\" Schaumann explains. \"Our main priority is to protect the LHC and its magnets.\"The operators went for a second run, this time placing six bunches of atoms instead of 24. The LHC was able to maintain the beam for two hours before dumping it intentionally.The experts were surprised to find that the LHC could maintain the beam for about 40 hours, far more than their 15-hour prediction. The question now is whether the LHC can maintain the beam at higher energies by changing the machine's settings, which were optimized for protons during the experiment.Experiment Could Lead To Gamma RaysThe findings could one day allow scientists to generate gamma rays in new ways. The process would involve shooting a laser at atoms, which would excite electrons and make them jump to a higher energy level.As these electrons bounce back to their previous levels, they would produce photons. Because the atom is moving at crazy speeds, the energy of the light particle would be boosted.The generated gamma rays could be used to produce particles such as electrons, quarks, and even muons. They could also lead to new kinds of matter, including dark matter and other forms.", "id": "688"}

And so far, fans are enjoying this experience much more than the other locations.Everyone that I have talked who has gone to camp in the past say that this is a much better location. It is more centrally located, it has better parking options, and the facility is state of the art. If the fans can access the location easier, crowds are larger.Fans seem to like the relatively easy drive for the new location as well. People I have talked to say it\u2019s a very easy drive up or down 31 to get to the complex. It allows more fans to come to training camp and watch the team.There are also a bunch of fun activities set out for kids. They have different training camp drills they can do, as well as plenty of food and beverages. Grand Park is truly set up for a great day for the entire family, and people are taking advantage of that.I will be heading to Colts training camp on Sunday evening for their practice. I\u2019m very eager to see for myself just how great the setup is. And of course to watch the team practice in person and to have analysis prepared for my observations.Early returns on Grand Park are in fact grand. And that\u2019s good news for the team and its fans.", "id": "689"}
{"content": "TAAAXI. It\u2019s history in the making. Today, NASA announced the first commercial astronauts who will be piloting the first crewed test-flights aboard SpaceX and Boeing spacecraft. Two teams of astronauts will be boarding a Boeing Starliner spacecraft launched on top of an Atlas V rocket and a Dragon capsule atop SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9, respectively.The crews are made up of nine (all American) high-ranking engineers, NASA astronauts, Marines, and Air Force pilots. Among them is Doug Hurley, a Marine Corps test pilot who piloted the iconic Space Shuttle one last time back in July 2011.In fact, if all goes according to plan, these missions would be the first time American astronauts are launching from U.S. soil since the retirement of the Space Shuttle in 2011.ABORT, ABORT. It\u2019s a momentous occasion that is setting the groundwork for the future of commercial space travel. But there\u2019s an elephant in the room that is somewhat souring the occasion. Just a day earlier, Boeing announced it had to delay the first uncrewed test flight after an abort engine issue forced a test to be cut short back in June \u2013 although it\u2019s still unclear if it was the main cause for the delays. As a result, the first crewed test had to be pushed back to the summer of 2019 as well.The Commercial Space Race is really starting to heat up. Amazon and Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos is aggressively increasing the funding of his spaceflight company, According to Reuters. Blue Origin\u2019s primary objective right now: get a new heavy-launch vehicle called New Glenn into space within the next two years.SPACE TRAVELING IN STYLE. Despite these delays, astronauts have a far more comfy ride to the International Space Station to look forward to \u2013 way more comfy than the cramped Soyuz spacecraft still in service today, despite the fact that its designs date back to the 1960s.Boeing received $4.2 billion for its Commercial Crew Transportation Capability program in 2014, while SpaceX got $2.6 billion at the same time. The goal: to develop the first generation of commercial (manned) spacecraft, finally bringing space travel into the 21st century.Both Boeing\u2019s Starliner and SpaceX\u2019s Dragon can fit up to seven astronauts (depending on cargo) \u2014 the Soyuz spacecraft still in use today can only carry three. The Starliner is even equipped with wireless internet for some (much-needed) in-flight entertainment. It can even stay docked to the ISS for 210 days, giving it the potential to serve as astronaut quarters.ALL IN GOOD TIME. It\u2019s still not entirely clear when SpaceX\u2019s Dragon spacecraft will go on its first manned test flight. In fact, SpaceX\u2019s official website still predicts the first manned test flight to take place \u201cas early as 2018.\u201d But when the time comes, astronauts will be able to enjoy environmental control and chose comfy onboard temperatures between 65 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit (18.3 and 26.6 Celsius).Even in the worst case scenario, the Dragon\u2019s emergency escape system will gently push astronauts out to safety \u201cexperiencing about the same G-forces as a ride at Disneyland\u201d according to SpaceX\u2019s official website.The future of commercial space travel is looking bright, but not all systems are go. engineers have their work cut out to ensure the safety of the first nine brave astronauts.

{"content": "July 30--Welcome to Clout Street: Morning Spin, our weekday feature to catch you up with what's going on in government and politics from Chicago to Springfield. Subscribe here.Topspin:As Mayor Rahm Emanuel stood with Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan on Friday and declared their agreement to reform the Chicago Police Department would \"stand the test of time,\" mayoral challenger Lori Lightfoot was watching closely.Emanuel once had appointed Lightfoot to serve as president of the Chicago Police Board, the civilian panel in charge of making the final decision in police disciplinary cases. The mayor also appointed the former federal prosecutor to co-chair his Police Accountability Task Force, which issued a series of recommended police reforms after the Laquan McDonald police shooting scandal.Even as she served as an Emanuel appointee, Lightfoot at times challenged the mayor's commitment to police reform. That was especially true after Emanuel had agreed in the final days of President Barack Obama's administration to allow a federal court to oversee and enforce reforms to the Chicago Police Department.But once Obama left office, Emanuel sought to reach an out-of-court agreement with the President Donald Trump's administration. The mayor submitted a so-called memorandum of understanding to Trump's U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, but refused to release it publicly. Lightfoot slammed it in June 2017 as \"fundamentally flawed\" and leaving the Chicago Police Department \"set up for failure.\"A few months later, Madigan sued Emanuel's City Hall and forced the mayor back into negotiating what he had committed to with the Obama administration -- a federal consent decree ensuring the police reforms.\"Let's recount the history. This is the same guy who was perfectly content to not have the new Trump Justice Department do anything, and who came up with a document -- that so-called memorandum of agreement -- that wasn't worth the paper it was written on,\" Lightfoot said in an interview after Emanuel and Madigan's news conference. \"We are here in this moment because of Lisa Madigan's courage, let's make no mistake about it. Rahm Emanuel was drug kicking and screaming down this path, and I thank goodness our attorney general had the intestinal fortitude to see a need and step into a void. We are going forward because of her, not him.\"In an emailed statement, Emanuel campaign spokeswoman Caron Brookens said the mayor had \"first worked with the Obama Justice Department to move forward with reforms that would improve public safety and policing.\" The Emanuel campaign also criticized Lightfoot for not noting the mayor has opposed the Trump administration on immigration and in pushing for stricter gun laws. The mayor's campaign, however, did not address the criticism of Emanuel seeking to strike an out-of-court agreement with the Trump administration.\"Lori Lightfoot's selective memory is troubling, especially since the mayor's leadership on public safety and police accountability is exactly why she was appointed to her previous positions,\" Brookens said. (Bill Ruthhart)What's on tap*Mayor Emanuel has no events scheduled.*Gov. Bruce Rauner will act on legislation at the Chicago Police Memorial.*The Rev. Gregory Seal Livingston will have a City Hall news conference about Thursday's planned Lake Shore Drive march.From the notebook*Vallas hits, too: Lightfoot wasn't the only mayoral candidate to weigh in on the consent decree issue. Former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas criticized Emanuel for \"playing politics\" with the Police Department and damaging it with \"micromanaging.\" He also said the mayor failed to institute \"common-sense\" reforms outlined by his own police accountability task force. A Vallas spokesman, however, did not respond to questions about what specific reforms he was referencing.The rest of the mayoral field was relatively quiet about the major Friday afternoon development. That includes former police Superintendent Garry McCarthy, who previously has criticized the Obama Justice Department investigation of CPD and questioned whether a consent decree is necessary. McCarthy did not respond to requests for comment. (Bill Ruthhart)*Coming to a TV screen near you: Democratic candidate J.B. Pritzker was in the Logan Square neighborhood on Friday to launch what his campaign is calling the \"Illinois Workdays\" series.The effort is aimed at showing Pritzker working alongside regular people in various jobs and industries. Pritzker, an heir to the Hyatt Hotel fortune, is worth an estimated $3.5 billion, according to Forbes. So he might be trying to overcome campaign concerns about how well regular Illinoisans can relate to him.On Friday, Pritzker was at the Sip of Hope Coffee Bar, video crew in tow, where he talked to the manager and workers. Proceeds from the coffee bar go to support suicide prevention and mental health education. Pritzker has spoken of the need for more state funding for mental health.

It doesn't help Illinois manufacturing companies or their workers.

{"content": "A female Colorado Avalanche fan doesn\u2019t understand why no one questions her about her favorite team.The Colorado Avalanche are my team. I love to talk hockey, and I have a couple second-tier favorite teams (Washington Capitals, Ottawa Senators). However, I\u2019m an Avs fan through and through.Not too long ago, a male sports fan sent out a tweet about whether female sports fans were ever dismissed for their opinions. The resounding answer was \u201cYes.\u201d Woman after woman told stories that pretty much relied on the same theme \u2014 when they expressed their fandom, male fans would quiz them. Often these quizzes came in the form of \u201cName five players on that team.\u201dI\u2019ve been involved in the reverse. I challenged a Denver Post peddler to name one Colorado Avalanche player if he wanted me to buy the newspaper for its sports coverage. When he came up with \u201cPeter Forsberg,\u201d I told him it needed to be a current player. He was unable to do so, and I walked away without a subscription.However, I dream about being quizzed. One woman detailed a scenario in which she asked the bartender to turn the TV to a hockey game, and he stated he\u2019d only do so if she could, you guessed it, \u201cname five players on the team.\u201dI\u2019ve walked into a local sports bar after clothes shopping \u2014 with copious shopping bags in hand \u2013and asked the bartender to change the television to \u201cany hockey game.\u201d When asked which one, I remarked that I didn\u2019t care because the Avs weren\u2019t playing. I got the NHL Network highlights, which was good enough because this was a football-centric bar.But why-oh-why didn\u2019t the bartender, or other male hockey fans, challenge me? To be clear, you don\u2019t have to worry about challenging me in the comments section \u2014 that\u2019s happened plenty of times. I don\u2019t get challenged on Twitter so much as dismissed \u2014 though Tom Hunter of Mile High Hockey \u201chelps\u201d me via DMs every now and again. (For the record, Conor Timmins is NOT suffering from concussion syndrome, and I\u2019m too relieved to fret about Hunter\u2019s conveyance of the news.)But\u2026 I dream about a man asking me in person to name five players on the Colorado Avalanche. Imagine! I could move down the lines, adding anecdotes and opinions along the way:\u201cThe first line consists of Nathan MacKinnon, Mikko Rantanen and Gabriel Landeskog. MacKinnon \u2014 who doesn\u2019t like to be called MacK \u2014 and Rantanen had career seasons. Landeskog\u2019s was his second-best, after the Golden Why Not Us year. Now, the second most consistent line was the checking line consisting of \u2018Long Beach Native\u2019 Matt Nieto, Carl Soderberg and Blake Comeau, now of the Dallas Stars\u2026\u201dSomewhere along the lines I\u2019d transition to prospects:\u201cRight now our most promising prospect who\u2019s actually signed with the team is Conor Timmins, who is not suffering from concussion syndrome, but that upper ankle sprain is worrisome. Well, Timmins isn\u2019t going to win any skating contests, but if he can score at even a quarter of the rate he did at major juniors\u2026\u201dI might even get a little pugnacious and challenge, \u201cCan you name all seven pieces we received in the Matt Duchene trade?\u201dA few years ago, I did get the question, \u201cWho\u2019s your favorite player?\u201d like I\u2019m a kid. I\u2019m prepared even for that question now:\u201cAll around, my favorite player is Erik Johnson. He\u2019s the cornerstone of the Avs\u2019 defense. However, if we\u2019re talking favorite rookie, I\u2019m going with Tyson Jost. On any given night, the Colorado Avalanche suited up four or five rookies last ceiling. I just think Jost\u2019s ceiling is the highest. Now, if the Avs are down by one or two late in the third period, I\u2019m all for playing Mr. Clutch, Tyson Barrie. On the power play, he\u2019s Swiss cheese, though, and I prefer Mr. Cool-as-a-Cucumber Sam Girard\u2026\u201dI dream so much about these situations recurring that I\u2019ve even tried to trigger them. For example, on Memorial Day a non-hockey friend of mine and I walked into local hockey bar Sobo. It was the first game of the Stanley Cup Finals. I wasn\u2019t geared up as a hockey fan, though, because my friend and I had just been doing Memorial Day activities.Nonetheless, I cozied up to the bar and spied a Caps fan. I nodded at him and asked, \u201cAre your boys going to get it done tonight?\u201dHe gave me a serious answer. He was wrong \u2014 the Caps lost Game 1 \u2014 but he gave me a serious answer.I tried even harder later. I introduced the topic of hockey in the most vacuous approach, by commenting on players\u2019 hair. The marine-looking dude I was talking to grunted and asked, \u201cDo you think Las Vegas is going to win the Stanley Cup?\u201d I went off on a rant about why Washington\u2019s winning was the better story until the marine acquiesced and changed the topic to football.For a while, I had thought that male sports fans in Colorado were simply more enlightened. I placed credit with the Denver Broncos. I figured that, since Broncos fandom was something of a religion here in Colorado, male sports fans just expected female fans to be conversant in sports.However, I asked some of my female Avalanche friends if that was their experience. It was not. For the most part, guys who knew them valued their opinions. But random guys did not.So, why is my experience so different? Well, I think a large part of the reason is my work on this site. Believe it or not, I actually do a lot of research on the Colorado Avalanche for posts here. I retain that knowledge, and I can spout it off whenever. In other words, I\u2019m as ranty in public as I am on this site.I think a lot of it is my approach, too. I\u2019m the one bringing the topic up, so dudes figure it\u2019s a topic I like and can talk about. And, to be fair, I may have a pretty active resting bitch face.Finally, it could just be that I don\u2019t notice any condescension. I\u2019m getting to talk hockey, so I don\u2019t care if the dude is taking me seriously or not. In fact, more often than not, I go into so much detail, that the male fan backs off and states, \u201cI\u2019m really more into football.\u201dI\u2019ve gotten so used to that situation that, recently, when I started talking about going to the Colorado Avalanche\u2019s prospect development camp, the male fan went straight to Shane Bowers. I perked up, thinking, \u201cFinally! An in-depth conversation!\u201d He may well have been challenging me, but I didn\u2019t care \u2014 I had opinions I wanted to share.How about it, though, dear reader? Would you like me to name five players on the Colorado Avalanche or tell you who my favorite is? Please? I\u2019ve been studying for this pop quiz for some time.", "id": "693"}
{"content": "July 26--The Pac-12 Networks are in active conversations with AT&amp;T about extending their partnership through the 2018-19 sports season, networks president Mark Shuken told the Hotline on Wednesday.Carriage on DirecTV for the networks is not part of the discussion, however.\"We've isolated the conversation to one of continuing the current terms with U-verse alone,\" he said, \"instead of continuing the conversation about DirecTV.\"The original contract was signed in 2013 -- one year after the launch of the Pac-12 Networks -- and expires this summer.AT&amp;T didn't own DirecTV at the time. It acquired the satellite provider two years later and engaged in carriage negotiations with the Pac-12.AT&amp;T's proposal was rejected (unanimously) by the conference chancellors and presidents.The omission of DirecTV carriage from the current discussions means the impasse, a source of deep frustration for fans, will continue for at least one more year -- but only if the networks and AT&amp;T agree to extend the current deal.If they don't add the evergreen clause for 2018-19 and AT&amp;T walks away, there is no chance of distribution on DirecTV.Under the terms of the current partnership, AT&amp;T owns sponsorship and wireless rights to Pac-12 events, and the conference receives telecom services and carriage on U-verse.U-verse has approximately four million subscribers, only a portion of which are within the Pac-12 footprint.Shuken said he hopes for a resolution \"in days, not weeks.\"Asked if there might be a new streaming deal before football season, Shuken said his focus was on keeping a current provider (AT&amp;T) before moving to finalize an agreement with a new one.(The Pac-12 Networks are currently available on Sling and fuboTV.)Shuken also addressed, indirectly, the developments with the Big Ten Network, which is engaged in a carriage dispute with Comcast.As of this moment, Comcast will stop showing the the network in markets within the conference footprint on Sept. 1.BTN president Mark Silverman called the situation \"our biggest challenge since the launch\" (in 2007).If Comcast drops the immensely-popular network (50 million subscribers) could signal distribution trouble ahead for other conference networks.Shuken declined to comment specifically on the Big Ten situation but indicated the Pac-12 Networks, which have approximately 20 million subscribers, aren't in danger of losing carriage in the near term (beyond U-verse).\"We're fortunate to have distribution deals secure through 2024, including with Comcast,\" he said.All of the Pac-12's major media contracts -- from the networks' deals with Comcast, Dish and Cox to the conference's Tier 1 agreements with ESPN and Fox -- expire at the conclusion of the 2023-24 sports cycle.------Why we need your support: Like so many other providers of local journalism across the country, the Hotline's parent website, mercurynews.com, recently moved to a subscription model.

{"content": "July 27--If Yu Darvish wasn't injured or Tyler Chatwood had pitched up to expectations, the Cubs would have had no need to acquire starter Cole Hamels for the stretch run.If the Cubs had drafted and developed a reliable starter or two over their first five drafts under the Theo Epstein regime, at least one would be ready by now and they would have had no need for Hamels.If the rest of the rotation had pitched up to its talent level the first three months, the Cubs would have had a big enough lead in the National League Central and no need for Hamels.None of those things happened, of course, and that's why the Cubs are bringing in a 34-year-old pitcher who appears to be past his sell-by date.The deal was made official Friday, with the Cubs sending pitcher Eddie Butler, Class A pitcher Rollie Lacy and a player to be named to the Rangers for Hamels and cash.Now it's up to Hamels to prove himself, and in doing so prove Epstein right for making the move.In this age of five-inning starters, it shouldn't be much to ask Hamels to eat innings, which once was his specialty. He threw 200 or more innings in eight of nine seasons between 2009 and '16.And in 12 starts from April 13 to June 19, Hamels had a 3.02 ERA and limited hitters to a .215 average, throwing six or more innings in 11 of the 12 games. That pitcher would be slotted in as No. 2 in the Cubs rotation behind Jon Lester, and we probably wouldn't be debating the merits of the trade.It's the last five starts that are concerning. Hamels has compiled a 10.23 ERA since June 25 with a .370 opponents' average and a 1.043 OPS against. He allowed seven runs in three of those starts and lasted only two-thirds of an inning in another.If this were a one-month slump during Hamel's Phillies days, you could shrug it off. But pitchers as a rule wear down as they age, and Hamels is no different. That doesn't mean he doesn't have anything left, but we shouldn't expect him to be the same pitcher he was three or four years ago.What the Cubs can say is their frustration level with Chatwood is at peak levels, and they needed someone -- anyone -- to make up for Chatwood's dismal performance.The 85 walks in 94 innings is outrageous, the kind of stat that normally would lead to a demotion. Chatwood has a 21-walk lead over the next-worst offender in the category, White Sox starter Lucas Giolito. He's on his way to becoming the first pitcher with 100 or more walks since Edison Volquez and Ricky Romero issued 105 in 2012.Cubs fans clearly are tired of hearing about his great \"stuff\" when they can see his wildness almost every outing. He ranked fourth-worst in the majors last year with 77 walks, so it's not exactly shocking. But it's now beyond annoying to watch.Of course you can't send down a pitcher in the first year of a three-year, $38 million deal, so Chatwood stays and likely gets another chance to redeem himself.Forgetting about Darvish's uncertain return date or the possibility of Drew Smyly pitching in to help, the only question that matters now is how Epstein and Joe Maddon will fit six pitchers into what has been a five-man rotation.A six-man rotation would be one way, but you would be punishing the one guy, Lester, who has given you the most. For now, Maddon said Friday the Cubs would stick with a five-man plan.It was no secret Lester and Jake Arrieta weren't big fans of going to a six-man rotation in the past. Like most starters, they like their routines between starts, and an extra day off forces them to change.But both went along with the plan, and the bottom line is it worked.After recovering from a poor outing after the All-Star break with a strong performance against the Diamondbacks on Wednesday, Lester had an interesting remark on coming out of the game in the seventh after serving up a tying home run to A.J. Pollock on his 103rd pitch.Lester admitted he wanted to go one more batter.\"My job is to throw the ball as long as I'm told to,\" he said. \"I don't make those decisions. I think in any workplace you don't always agree with your boss, but he's your boss and he makes decisions, so there's nothing you can really do about it.\"There's nothing Lester can do about it if his boss goes with a six-man rotation, even if it's not his fault the Cubs are in that position. He does have clout, but we haven't seen him exercise it like he did with the Red Sox.The Cubs could send Mike Montgomery back to the bullpen, pointing to his workload and a 1.50 WHIP in three starts in July.It would be difficult to rationalize keeping Chatwood in the rotation and putting Montgomery back with the dancing relievers, other than to point out Montgomery can fill any role needed and the Cubs have a hole in the late-inning lefty role Brian Duensing was supposed to fill but has not.Like Lester, Montgomery might not agree with his bosses if Epstein and Maddon go this route, but there's really nothing he can do about it either.No matter how the pieces of the puzzle fit, it's going to be fascinating to watch the last two months and in October.psullivan@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "695"}

The next stage, Helfrich said, is for Trubisky to develop total command of it all.\"It's an evolution to get to exactly who you want where by route,\" Helfrich said. \"Who you want where in the run game. What your strengths are. What the things you don't necessarily want to major in are. That starts, certainly, with the quarterback and then every other position group around him.\"At this point for Trubisky, when he receives a play call, coaches notice him nod his head as he processes each element of the call: The formation, the motion, the protection and the routes.Eventually, that thought process will become \"instantaneous,\" Helfrich said.\"In a game plan situation, he'll know what's coming,\" he said. \"So for a quarterback, you just want an immediate picture in your head of what's going on. One thing to think about, not seven.\"Right now, we're still at that stage where it's, OK, who's at this position? What's my personnel group? What's the snap count? And all the things that take place. It is truly a process right now whereas that will be seamless.\"And that's just before the snap.\"He's got a great release,\" Helfrich said. \"He sees things pretty well, and that's the thing, probably, if he has anything to (work on, it's) just processing why we're doing A, B, and C. That's ongoing. It's not slow, but it's never immediate, which is what every coach wants.\"rcampbell@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "697"}

{"content": "July 30--SAN FRANCISCO -- Pablo Sandoval and Andrew McCutchen both left the Giants 8-5 win over the Brewers at AT&amp;T Park Sunday, potentially joining Cueto, Brandon Belt, Joe Panik, Jeff Samardzija and Hunter Strickland on the list of players battling injuries as the club attempts to climb back into the playoff race in the National League West.Sandoval strained his right-hamstring as he was sliding into home in the fifth, scoring on a sacrifice fly after he brought in two runs with a triple into the right field corner. The infielder will undergo an MRI in San Diego Monday to access the damage. Later in the game, McCutchen got pulled after he suffered an injury by fouling multiple balls off his foot.Sandoval said the injury felt similar to the hamstring strain he suffered in 2012 while doing the splits at first base. He's hoping the injury won't put him on the disabled list this time around.\"We're going to do an MRI tomorrow, so we'll see what's going on,\" he said.Meanwhile, Cueto met with doctors Sunday to access whether he'll need Tommy John surgery after he pitched a season-low four innings Saturday night. After the game, Cueto, who's made four starts since his return from the disabled list on July 5, acknowledged that he's been feeling discomfort every time he throws a pitch. An update on Cueto's health is expected Monday.The Giants, who've lost 627 man games to injury this season, also placed Belt on the 10-day disabled list last week after he suffered a bone bruise in Seattle Wednesday.Buster Posey said the Giants bad luck with injuries this season is \"part of the game.\"\"It's going to happen,\" he said. \"You've got to be able to handle setbacks as a team. In the years where we've won the World Series, we've dealt with injuries.\"It's nothing.\"As the injuries mounted Sunday, the Giants managed to further stamp Bruce Bochy's place in baseball's record books as the manager took in the Hall of Fame ceremonies in Cooperstown. The win represented Bochy's 1,906th career victory as a Major League manager, pushing him past Casey Stengel into 11th place on baseball's all-time wins list.\"How about that?\" Posey said. \"He wasn't even here for it.\"The Giants skipper owes a solid to bench coach Hensley Meulens, who earned him the win by taking over managerial duties while he attended the induction of Trevor Hoffman, his closer with the San Diego Padres for 12 seasons.\"It's really special,\" Meulens said. \"Too bad he wasn't here to see it himself. I guess being at the Hall of Fame isn't a bad place to be today either, so congrats, coach.\"Bochy, who took a red-eye flight to Albany, N.Y. after Saturday's game, is planning to rejoin the club in time for pregame warmups in San Diego Monday.Despite the historic win, it's hard to imagine that Bochy did too much celebrating Sunday. In addition to the injuries, the Giants playoff chances are quickly circling the drain as the team's produced a 3-6 record since the All-Star break. The Giants trail three teams in the NL West standings, including the first place Los Angeles Dodgers by 6 1/2 games and the Arizona Diamondbacks by six games for the final wild card spot.As Bochy nudged his way past Stengel, the Giants did their best to steer management away from being sellers before Tuesday's non-waiver trade deadline.The Giants put together their most offensively-prolific game since the break, scoring eight runs off 13 hits, the type of effort they'll need to put forth on a nightly basis to push for a playoff spot down the stretch.\"It was really nice to see these guys put some runs on the board so we could break that spell,\" Meulens said.Buster Posey put together the type of game that Giants fans grew accustomed to seeing from him during the club's World Series years earlier this decade. Posey went 4 for 5 with three RBI and two runs scored. The Giants catcher, who's battling hip issues, got the club on the scoreboard in the third, bringing in three runs with a bases loaded double to left-center field, just his second extra base hit in 21 games.\"When that ball went into the gap and three runs scored, you could see the joy on everyone's faces in the dugout,\" Meulens said. \"We finally broke through and got a big hit.\"In addition, Posey singled in the fifth, scoring with Evan Longoria off Sandoval's triple, sixth and eighth, recording his first four-hit game since Sept. 15, 2016.The Giants also picked up runs off sacrifice flies from Longoria and Steven Duggar in the third and fifth, and Gorkeys Hernandez's 12th home run in the fourth.With the offensive breakout, the Giants finally provided support for Andrew Suarez (4-6), who did enough on the hill to earn his first win since June 29. After receiving three or fewer runs of support in 12 of his first 17 starts, Suarez needed the help Sunday, surrendering four earned runs off eight hits and a walk in six innings of work.\"It's huge that they scored that many runs, especially since I gave up four,\" Suarez said. \"We hit it really well.\"___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "699"}

On Saturday, the Vikings revealed exactly what the team is doing to fill the void left by Sparano\u2019s passing.Minnesota has announced that Clancy Barone and Andrew Janocko will be co-offensive line coaches for the 2018 season. Previously, Barone was the Vikings\u2019 tight ends coach and Janocko was the team\u2019s assistant offensive line coach.In addition to this move, Minnesota has also decided to have Todd Downing take over Barone\u2019s old role and coach the team\u2019s tight ends in 2018. Prior to Sparano\u2019s passing, Downing was on the Vikings\u2019 staff as a senior offensive assistant.For Barone, this is not his first time as an offensive line coach in the NFL. In 2010, 2015, and 2016, he was the offensive line coach for the Denver Broncos.

{"content": "Aug. 02--Zenobia, Queen of Palmyra is not an official member of the new-soul band Durand Jones &amp; The Indications.But the circa 1859 marble bust, be-robed and beatific, looked the part of a backup singer, more or less, as the band that formed at Indiana University performed in a row with her in the Art Institute of Chicago's classical sculpture court in a surprise Lollapalooza-museum event Thursday afternoon.The sad part, Art Institute painting conservator Allison Langley noted, was that the otherwise transcendent mini-concert did not find a way to incorporate the nearby 1874 statue Jephthah's Daughter, a depiction of a young woman who is literally holding a tambourine.\"How did we not get that in the shot?\" Langley asked.That minor art historical lament is one of the few that could be spoken about the event, which saw Jones and his band bring their version of the classics to the sculpture court a few days ahead of their scheduled Sunday appearance at the big festival outside museum doors in Grant Park.While much of suburban teendom scurried around outside, the few score people who happened to notice the band setting up in the museum, or who saw the @ArtInstituteChi teaser tweet at about 10:30 a.m. Thursday, were treated to two Indications tunes, performed entirely without amplification,Against those hard surfaces, in that open-to-the-ceiling room, the sound was lush and gorgeous: two different band voices, Jones and his drummer Aaron Frazer, plus trumpet, saxophone, percussion and Chicagoan Blake Rhein on guitar, simmering in a slow groove.\"It was so beautiful,\" said Frazer, who sang falsetto lead on \"Is It Any Wonder?\" \"It makes everything, like, extra dreamy.\"Rhein said that for the first time in a band performance he played -- entirely appropriately -- classical guitar.\"Oh, man,\" added Jones, who opened things with a resonant \"Make a Change.\" \"It reminded me of, like, a really big church. I just wanted to fill it up.\"Lollapalooza being the entertainment machine that it is, there were festival videographers on hand to record the performance. They hoped to cut the video right away and have it up on the Lolla website and/or YouTube channel fairly quickly, a staffer said.The performance came about at Lolla's suggestion to the museum, which has a partnership with the event, said a spokeswoman -- a much better and more workable idea than bringing a painting out onto festival grounds.Past Art Institute tie-ins, of sorts, to Lolla have included showing the art video \"A Lot of Sorrow\" during the summer of 2016. In it, the band The National, a headliner this year, is filmed playing its ballad \"Sorrow,\" over and over again, for more than six hours straight.Thursday's show was more succinct.\"Can you keep a secret?\" said the morning tweet. \"We've got something special happening in the galleries with our friends from @lollapalooza.\" Then it showed an image of Picasso's \"The Old Guitarist,\" a fixture in the Modern Wing and a clue to the type of event rather than its location.Langley and some curatorial staff were on hand to make sure the artworks were treated right, or for a break in the museum routine, or both. Having the band play acoustic helped, as did the fact that the public was asked to watch from up above, peering into the court from the surrounding railings. (They appeared to be, for the record, considerably younger than the crowd walking through the nearby John Singer Sargent special exhibition moments before.)In such a circumstance, the biggest worry, Langley said, would be \"visitors bobbing and weaving\" and maybe getting a little too close to a work. But all ended without incident, and those who happened to see it were treated to a different type of art filling their heads.Jones and band are also playing one of the Lolla aftershows, Friday night at Thalia Hall, the singer said. And considering that Lollapalooza is a multi-day event, music fans might want to keep an eye on the museum's Twitter feed, just in case the crossover inspiration strikes again.sajohnson@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "703"}
{"content": "The CDC has linked the current salmonella outbreak to backyard chickens in multiple states. Since the year 2000, 70 salmonella outbreaks have been associated with live poultry. ( Pixabay )According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 212 people have already fallen ill with salmonella in over 40 states. What are some important steps to take to reduce the chances of getting infections from backyard chickens?Salmonella OutbreakAs of the latest update, 88 more people were reported to be infected with salmonella, bringing the total number of salmonella infections up to 212. The illnesses began in February of this year, with 34 of the ill requiring hospitalization. Fortunately, no deaths are linked to the multistate outbreak.Investigations so far link the illnesses to contact with chicks and ducklings that came from multiple sources and hatcheries. In fact, 72 percent of the ill who were available for interviews reported having contact with chicks or ducklings in the week before they fell ill, the animals having come from either hatcheries, websites, feed supply stores, and even relatives.CDC investigations are still ongoing, but 22 of the isolates from the ill people contained genes that are expected to have some form of resistance to common antibiotics such as ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, gentamicin, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. Because of this antibiotic resistance, some of the infections may require other kinds of antibiotics.Backyard ChickensMore and more people have been keeping chickens in their own backyards, but while it is a great experience for many, it also increases the risks of getting illnesses and infections from being in close contact with the chickens. In fact, CDC data reveals that there have been 70 salmonella outbreaks linked to backyard chickens since the year 2000, resulting in over 4,700 illnesses, almost 900 hospitalizations, and seven deaths.Such infections may be gotten from chickens\u2019 bodies and droppings, even when they look clean and healthy. These germs may then spread to the coops, hay, food and water containers, and even on the soil and plants in the area where they live and roam. Because of this, people who get in contact with infected items may still get infected even without getting in direct contact with the chickens.Children are said to be more susceptible to such infections because their immune systems are still developing. In fact, 26 percent of the ill in the current outbreak are children below 5 years old.Reducing Infection ChancesTo reduce the chances of getting salmonella from backyard chickens, the CDC recommends thoroughly washing the hands right after handling chickens or anything from the area where they roam and live. It\u2019s also important to remember not to eat or drink in the chickens\u2019 area and to not kiss or snuggle them.The chickens should not be allowed to roam or live inside the house, particularly in parts of the house where food and drinks are stored, prepared, or served. Children, the elderly, and other people with weakened immune systems should not be allowed to handle live poultry, and it is also wise to have separate footwear for taking care of the chickens to be kept outside of the house at all times.", "id": "704"}
{"content": "A Harvard astrophysicist said that outer space is a little bit closer to Earth than previously believed. Mathematical modeling showed that space is just 50 miles above the surface of the Earth. ( Pixabay )Where does Earth's atmosphere and outer space begin? A new paper says space is just 50 miles away from the planet's surface.Astrophysicist Jonathan McDowell of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics argues that scientists may have gotten the boundary of outer space all wrong.In a new study scheduled for publication in the Acta Astronautica journal, McDowell says outer space begins at a 50-mile altitude, a whole 12 miles lower than the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n Line, which represents the prevalent theory since the 1960s that outer space begins 62 miles above the surface of the Earth.What Is The K\u00e1rm\u00e1n LineIn 1963, aerodynamics researcher Theodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n suggested that the speed needed to lift an object into the atmosphere is the same as the speed needed to keep it in orbit around the Earth. Von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n said that the horizontal movement of the object on orbit would counteract the effects of gravity.However, McDowell says the traditional view of the edge of space is based on decades of misinterpreted data about objects orbiting the Earth.Since he was 13 years old, McDowell has been collecting data about every rocket launched into space, a hobby that often compelled him to identify which rockets actually went into outer space and which ones remained within the Earth's atmosphere.Edge Of Space Closer Than Previously ThoughtIn his study, McDowell examined the orbital patterns of 43,000 satellites based on data he collected from the North American Aerospace Defense Command, which tracks aerospace in the United States and Canada.An overwhelming majority of the satellites were located in orbit well above the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n Line, which means they are inarguably in outer space.However, 50 satellites caught McDowell's attention. After completing their missions, the satellites made several revolutions around the planet at altitudes well below the traditional 62-mile limit.The Soviet Elektron-4, for instance, went around the Earth 10 times at an altitude of 52 miles before entering the atmosphere and blowing itself up.\"Are you going to say [these satellites are] in space and then not in space every two hours?\" says McDowell. \"That doesn't seem very helpful.\"McDowell went on to develop a mathematical model that identifies the point at which satellites got off their orbits and burned themselves up during their entry into the atmosphere. The model pinpoints it is mostly at an altitude of 50 miles, although it can happen anywhere from 41 to 55 miles.Consistent With Existing KnowledgeThe new findings are consistent with existing knowledge about the atmosphere. The mesopause, which is the coolest layer of the atmosphere, sits 52 to 62 miles above the surface of the Earth.Here, temperatures drop drastically, and more charged particles are flowing freely about. In other words, the mesopause looks a lot more like space than the lower layers of the atmosphere.Meteors that hit the Earth also disintegrate at 43 to 62 miles above the planet, which is where the air in the atmosphere compresses and quickly heats up the meteor up to 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit.", "id": "705"}
{"content": "Since it took a pretty big hit back in February with the rest of the market, D.R. Horton (DHI)  has been mainly flat in 2018. But that's all about to change. D.R. Horton and the rest of the homebuilders have been very bouncy this year. They all took a hit when data showed that home sales in the U.S. had fallen. But that data was completely misunderstood. And the hit gave investors a great opportunity to buy shares at a discount. You see, the headline was all investors noticed: \"Home Sales Drop.\" But the information in the brief was actually extremely bullish for real estate prices, home sales, and homebuilders. The reason home sales had fallen was because inventories were shrinking. There weren't enough homes to sell to all the buyers. That has continued to be the theme all year, too. And the supply shortage is driving prices up all across the country.  Those higher prices mean that homebuilders like D.R. Horton can sell their products for a premium. Costs haven't really risen to keep pace with prices. So, that means more profit for the homebuilders on every house they sell. And those rising prices and this supply shortage is bringing the builders back online in a big way. As the builders start building, prices will stabilize some. And buyers who'd been driven out by a lack of choices and extreme competition will step back in. And we'll start seeing steady growth in home sales, real estate prices, and shares of D.R. Horton. Freddie Mac just released its predictions for the second half of 2018 \u2014 and they're pretty rosy. Total home sales are expected to rise by 2.5% this year. That's impressive when you consider low supply, high prices, and rising mortgage rates have constrained the market for the first half of the year. But more impressive is that the average sales price is expected to rise by almost 7% within the last six months of 2018. That's a massive increase when you're factoring in the entire market. And it'll drive shares in well-positioned homebuilders straight up the charts. So, before the headlines start reading \"Home Sales Soaring\" and the buyers drive D.R. Horton up, I recommend adding to your position or starting one if you haven't already. This stock will erase the loss from earlier this year. And it'll keep heading up as long as the housing market stays hot. I see at least a few more years of rising demand and prices before things cool off again. Let's make as much as we can while we can. Make hay while the sun shines. And make money while the market runs. D.R. Horton is a \"Strong Buy\" under $45 and the stock should be well above $50 by year's end.

The Red Wings team which has struggled to find consistent scoring, a few players that need to contribute more on a  regular basis.Detroit finished the 2017/18 season ranked 28th in the league with 2.6 goals per game. The power play finished ranked 24th overall converting 17.5% of its opportunities into goals. Detroit recorded on average 30.4 shots per game which ranked 25th in the league.It would be a significant boost for a team to improve in all of these categories together, that\u2019s something the Detroit Red Wings should focus on for this up and coming season. Detroit has to find a way to direct more pucks at the net, drive the middle lane hard to the net and look for a rebound. More shots equal more opportunities to score.Detroit has a few older players who need to focus more on contributing offensively to lengthen the depth of the Detroit line-up along with a youngster who is on the bubble to make the everyday roster. If Detroit can find a way to acquire more scoring from the bottom of the line-up instead of being so top heavy it will bode well for their future.We have four candidates we hope can bounce back or continue to provide some scoring and possibly over-achieve in 2018/19.", "id": "707"}

{"content": "With the 2018 Hall of Fame class being inducted on Saturday, let us take a look at five Raiders who should already be donning a Gold Jacket.The 2018 Hall of Fame class does have a splash of the Raiders franchise in it, as Randy Moss will be enshrined on the first ballot. Moss played for the Raiders during the 2005 and 2006 seasons, racking up over 1,000 yard in 2005, but then going to New England and being much more productive.While Moss was a Hall of Fame player, he certainly did not show that during his time with the Raiders. In fact, people could even go as far as forgetting he was a Raider, but not the fans of the team, who saw him as a quitter during his time in the Silver and Black.Today, Moss and the rest of the 2018 Hall of Fame class will be enshrined in Canton, and while it is an incredible class, you have to believe there are still Raiders from the past who continue to get snubbed. In fact, one Raider is considered by many as the biggest Hall of Fame snub of all-time.The history of the Raiders is littered with some of the best players in football history, and it is pretty disappointing that some of these guys have yet to be immortalized. We dive into five Raiders who should have already gotten a Gold Jacket, and for Raider Nation, we are still waiting to see them get up on the podium, though some will have to be enshrined posthumously.Here are the five Raiders who we feel should already be inducted in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.", "id": "710"}
{"content": "July 30--For most of its 101-year history, John Fellowes' family company, maker of the Bankers Box, helped businesses deal with paper records.By the time the fourth-generation CEO began leading Fellowes Brands in 2014, businesses were increasingly swapping paper for pixels.Fellowes thinks the Itasca-based company can keep up with changes in the office by branching out into new kinds of products, like sit-stand desks and ergonomic accessories that promote a healthier workplace.Q: What was your first job?A: There was a rule in our family that when you turn 16 you had to earn all your own spending money. I made shredder assemblies on the manufacturing line.Q: Did you always know you wanted to join the family business?A: I had times I thought this was exactly what I wanted to do, and there were times I thought this is exactly what I don't want to do. When I had my first job (as an adult), it was not at Fellowes -- I worked in the asset management industry for a little while. I realized that this was a unique opportunity and that it was a tradition I wanted to continue. But I told my father when I came back that I was not necessarily going to succeed him.Q: What were the biggest challenges you saw when you moved into company leadership?A: The environment we were playing in. The world is changing very quickly, and we recognized the pace of change was increasing in 2010 and 2011. A lot of the products we were producing at the time depended on paper, whether that's a shredder or a laminator or a binder or a file box. The other thing is people were just working differently. We started to rethink our business and what it needed to do to be relevant.Q: One of the new categories you're in is wellness and healthy workplace products, like sit-stand desks. Why?A: We've found that's an area where we can add value to the marketplace. It's also very consistent with who we've been as a company. Fellowes is a brand that has always been about trying to help people be at their best.Q: Was it an easy leap to go from Bankers Boxes to those new products?A: In 1983, we got into shredders, computer accessories and lots of different product categories that required us to increase our capabilities as an overall business. We have expertise in engineering, we have an understanding of electronics and we have a really strong industrial design capability. We had that platform we could leap off of.Q: Do you ever see a future with a document-free office?A: As a society, we're using half the paper that we used in the year 2000. Paper is going to continue to be an important part of office and home life. But that just brings the urgency to us that we need to continue to transform as a business.Q: Would you encourage your own kids to join the family business?A: It's a great option and a great opportunity, and I would be thrilled if one day down the road they decide that that's for them, but there's no pressure there.lzumbach@chicagotribune.comMORE BACK STORY INTERVIEWS___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "711"}
{"content": "The Minnesota Wild and forward Jason Zucker have come to terms on a new contract, getting the deal done just days before the scheduled arbitration meeting.Restricted free agent, Jason Zucker, and the Minnesota Wild have agreed to a contract the will see the veteran forward staying with the team for 5 years. A deal identical in length to what defensemen Mathew Dumba signed last week.The $27.5 million dollar contract averages out to $5.5M/Year, with a fluctuating yearly salary to allow the Wild some breathing room under the salary cap. The 2018-19 cap hit will be approximately $5 Million (per NHL.com).Zucker, a 2010 second round draft pick, had a breakout season setting career highs in goals (33), assists (31), points (64), power-play points (16), game-winning goals (7), and shots (222), while never missing a game. He firmly established himself as a reliable top player on a team in desperate need of one. Jason Zucker took the long way around to making the Minnesota Wild NHL roster. He struggled mightily under head coach Mike Yeo, finding himself in the press box much more than a young player would have liked.Under Bruce Boudreau, however, he has taken his game to the next level, improving every season and earning a larger role in both even strength and power play time. Clearly, he is doing the most with what his coach is giving him.The money on this deal makes sense as well, at $5.5M/year this places Zucker on a level playing field with Mikael Granlund, Mikko Koivu, and Nino Niederreiter. Zucker, Granlund, and Niederreiter have each went over 55 points at least once in the last 2 seasons so it would only make sense they be on equal ground with their contracts.This deal is huge for him, it\u2019s big for the Minnesota Wild, but it\u2019s also big for the state of Minnesota. This deal secures the core of the team for 2 more seasons, allowing new General Manager Paul Fenton time to evaluate all of his options before making any drastic moves. In 2 years time, there are some tough decisions to be made in regards to who will stay and who should go. 2 years is a long time in the hockey world, though, and we will see what kind of manager Fenton can be based on how he handles the future of this team.Want your voice heard? Join the Gone Puck Wild team!For now, surprise trades notwithstanding, this is the last piece of offseason action that we were waiting for. We\u2019ve officially reached the dog days of summer, and now we wait for training camp and preseason to get underway.", "id": "712"}
{"content": "Aug. 02--Daniel Palka had one thing on his mind when he was summoned to pinch hit.A single probably would have put the White Sox ahead, but the big rookie was swinging for the fences.\"One hundred percent, homer,\" Palka said. \"Seriously. I wanted a ball up I can hit out of the park.\"Palka jumped on a nothing slider at the belt from Royals reliever Jason Hammel, driving it into the seats in right-center field for a three-run homer. It gave the Sox a 6-4 victory Thursday and a 2-4 record for the homestand at Guaranteed Rate Field.It was a moment worthy of the legendary South Side Hit Men and thus appropriate that it gave Palka a share of a franchise record. Oscar Gamble hit three pinch homers in 1977, setting the mark, and this was the third for Palka, who has 16 home runs in 244 at-bats.While blue-chip guys such as Yoan Moncada, Eloy Jimenez, Michael Kopech and Luis Robert command attention from the media and fans, it takes contributions from some unexpected sources to complete a successful rebuild. Palka, claimed off waivers from the Twins in November, is showing he can pound right-handers well enough to play a long-term role.\"(In) the last year and a half or so, the guys in the front office filtered through many, many players,\" manager Rick Renteria said. \"He was one of the guys they targeted, that they liked, and our scouts liked, and put in good reports. It wasn't by accident.\"General manager Rick Hahn credits scouts John Tumminia, Chris Lien and Keith Staab for leading him to give Palka, 26, a giving him second chance after he had fallen out of favor with the Twins.Palka would love everyday at-bats as a corner outfielder or designated hitter, but he looks more like a potential role player. That's fine with him if that's how it works.\"Yeah, man, whatever role is open,\" he said. \"I'm down to compete for it.\"Reynaldo Lopez has a shot to be a fixture in the White Sox rotation, but inconsistency has bothered him. He held the Royals scoreless through seven innings and left with the Sox leading 2-0 after a leadoff double and bunt single in the eighth.An entirely different game broke out with both bullpens involved. The Royals took a 3-2 lead when their pinch hitter, Whit Merrifield, hit a three-run homer off Xavier Cedeno in the eighth.\"I felt good,\" said Lopez, who cut his ERA to 4.47. \"I felt in command of all my pitches. I was focused today. I felt very good. At the end, it was crazy. ... It was a very emotional game, a very intense game.\"Jose Abreu started the eighth-inning rally with a tying homer off Jason Adam.\"Once Pito hit that homer, the energy in the dugout changed big time,\" Palka said. \"To get it started like that was big.\"Nothing was bigger than Palka's swing. There's no way to know where his career goes from here, but being mentioned next to Gamble is a cool way to start.Extra innings: The White Sox may add a catcher for the weekend series against the Rays in Florida. Kevan Smith's wife was in labor when the team left for Florida. ... Moncada struck out looking in all four at-bats, giving him a majors-high 149 strikeouts. He's on pace for 224, which would break Mark Reynolds' season record of 223 in 2009.Phil Rogers is a freelance reporter for the Chicago Tribune.___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "713"}
{"content": "Rumors have been linking wide receiver Dez Bryant and the Cleveland Browns, but this would be a mistake to pursue for the BrownsThings suddenly got very cloudy at the wide receiver position for the Cleveland Browns as Josh Gordon recently announced he will not be at the start of training camp and Ricardo Louis is already out for the season.While Gordon should be applauded for trying to make sure his personal well-being is handled, it does cause concern for the team especially when coupled with the loss of Louis.That concern has reportedly led to the Browns considering some alternative options. According to Josh Alper of Pro Football Talk, that could include kicking the tires on former Dallas Cowboys wideout Dez Bryant.Alper quotes Mary Kay Cabot of Cleveland.com as saying there\u2019s no timetable for when Gordon will return, which is why the front office could look outside for help.As for Bryant though, this one should be avoided. It\u2019s not even an argument that Dez is a talented player, because he is.However, talented players don\u2019t stay unemployed as long as he has without a history of baggage. And Bryant has that.While in Dallas, Bryant was an emotional player and at times it seemed to have taken its toll on those around him, especially during games in which the team was losing and he was demanding the ball.This was something that could be overlooked when Bryant was at his best. However, since his huge 2014 season, Dez hasn\u2019t been the same player making the trade off for his attitude not worth the reward for what he will bring to the field.For Cleveland, they\u2019re much better off looking elsewhere if they feel they have to add talent at receiver. Bryant simply isn\u2019t going to be worth any headache he brings.With the Browns working on developing a young quarterback like Baker Mayfield, it would be a mistake to bring in a dominating personality like Bryant who will surely be demanding the ball.", "id": "714"}
{"content": "The Baltimore Ravens and the Chicago Bears are going to give us the watered down football that comes with the preseason. It\u2019s important to take it seriously, as the process is actually quite important. The thing that we must not do is over analysis on the first of five preseason games:The Baltimore Ravens are going to play the Chicago Bears in the Pro Football Hall of Fame game. That being said you won\u2019t see Joe Flacco or much of the starters. You won\u2019t be able to read into the play-calling too much. You won\u2019t be able to see what the 2018 Ravens are actually going to look like. This is a game much more like a fourth preseason game than the standard opener. This game is for backups, bubble players and young studs to be.The number one thing the Ravens are going to display in Canton, Ohio is their depth. The Ravens have more depth than they had last year. The secondary for example added DeShon Elliott and Anthony Averett and Tavon Young is back from injury. The Ravens couldn\u2019t find seven viable receiver options last year, that isn\u2019t the case this August.The back-end of the Ravens receiving depth chart has a chance to make things interesting. The Ravens started the 2017 preseason with an already makeshift offensive line. In 2018, the Ravens are much more healthy along the offensive line. Marshal Yanda won\u2019t play Thursday night, be he probably wouldn\u2019t even if he was at full strength. The Ravens depth will be the first thing we actually get a glimpse of. If the Ravens look strong throughout the contest, it is a positive sign about the stuffed nature of their camp roster.The Ravens will also get to see which players are ahead of schedule. If for example, a player like Jordan Lasley steals the show, it is a sign that he is ready for bigger opportunities. The Ravens and their fans go into the game with certain expectations for their players. If players exceed those expectations, it doesn\u2019t mean they are the next big thing. It does however mean that they are ahead of where they were expected to be. Some players are gamers who will shine more in a game than they ever will in practice. That\u2019s why we could be in for some surprises.Ravens fans will get their first glimpse at Lamar Jackson. While his first NFL action is incredibly important, we must not overreact to what we see. If Jackson lights Chicago up, it changes nothing. If Jackson fails to excite, it changes nothing. He is vying to be the backup and he is a developing quarterback getting important reps. Ravens fans will get their first tease of the Jackson era, but no grand prognostication can come from Jackson\u2019s play against the Bears. That same thought could be applied to any rookie in this game.Baltimore will not find out what changes are coming from the defense. Don Martindale isn\u2019t trying to put on a show before the real games even start. Martindale\u2019s job is to get young players in a position to be successful. He will want to test his young players, but he\u2019ll be restrained with what he calls.This doesn\u2019t mean that he won\u2019t be more aggressive than Dean Pees was as defensive coordinator, just don\u2019t expect to see that aggressiveness on Thursday night. Play-calling this early in the preseason is calculated so the Ravens can evaluate what they want to evaluate. It\u2019s also very early into the preseason, especially because the Ravens and Bears get a head start to the exhibition affairs. Many of the players who will be on the field, aren\u2019t totally up to speed with the entire scheme. The same exact things can be said about Marty Mornhinweg and the offense.", "id": "715"}
{"content": "Aug. 02--Greetings, Lollapalooza goers, and welcome to Chicago, the city whose large lakefront park you're about to destroy.We're delighted you chose to come to our fine city, and we're inspired by your desire to spend four days standing in a writhing mass of perspiring humanity while listening to nearly 200 bands you've never heard of and four bands you actually like play music while strangers step on your feet.(To all Chicago-area people going to Lollapalooza, we're super excited for you and not at all sick of hearing you talk about how you're going to Lollapalooza. We hope you have the best time ever and don't contract a weird toe fungus!)If you've never been to the annual music festival in Grant Park, congratulations. You have made a wise decision.But if you're throwing that perfectly wise decision away and attending this year's epic, outdoor celebration of rock and questionable life choices, there are a few things you should know to minimize the regret that will set in as you're trampled by glitter-covered teenagers who heard Jaden Smith was spotted reading poetry to a unicorn near the \"glamping lounge\" at the Toyota Sienna Festivan Wonderland.You may want to laminate the following Lollapalooza Survival Guide and keep it tucked in the fanny pack that you're wearing ironically.DO AN AGE CHECK: Before departing, make sure you stop and look at the birth date on your driver's license. If you were born any time before Aug. 1, 1978, take your Lollapalooza tickets and smack yourself in the face with them repeatedly.What are you thinking? If you're even in the ballpark of 40 years old, you're going to look ridiculous standing among throngs of gyrating youth and pretending you know that Lil Pump is a rapper and not a thing you use to inflate your kid's pool float.No matter how you dress, no matter how well you know the lyrics to every song by The Flarps, everyone will assume you got lost on your way to a Jimmy Buffet concert.And just to show how unhip you are, there isn't a band called The Flarps. But you thought there was, didn't you? Now tear up those tickets and go see a movie or run to Target or something.DO A SANITY CHECK: You have your tickets, you've applied sunscreen, and you've taken your preferred hallucinogen. Now you just need to sit back for a moment and consider what you're getting yourself into.It's summer in Chicago, which means it will be hot and muggy. You are making a conscious decision to go and stand in the sun for at least 10 hours surrounded by about 100,000 other sunscreen-slathered human meat sacks.They will be making noise. They will be in a wide array of altered states of mind. And some, invariably, will attempt to urinate on your foot. If you're fortunate enough to not have someone urinate directly on your foot, you will absolutely, at some point during those long 10 hours, step in urine that is not your own.There will also be vomit. Lots and lots of vomit.You will find that a number of your Lollapalooza colleagues are somehow morally opposed to using deodorant. The experience of dancing to a band called Rainbow Kitten Surprise will be made slightly less fantastic by the guy in front of you who is jumping up and down with his arms up, each time brushing your nose with his armpit and smacking you in the face with his white-guy dreadlocks.(If any of my fellow 40-or-over people are still reading, Rainbow Kitten Surprise is an actual band playing at Lollapalooza. I bet you thought I was making that one up, didn't you? Stay home and stay in your lane, losers.)So before you get to Grant Park, consider all these things, and remember: You can sell the tickets you paid $34,000 for and then spend the day relaxing in an air-conditioned room listening to music on your phone and not being jostled by glazed-eyed, shirtless bros with unnecessary facial hair.JUST HAVE FUN!: If you've made it through the age check and the sanity check, there's no hope for you, so you might as well as get to the park and start having what people who add marijuana buds to their wheatgrass smoothies call \"fun.\"The good news is you will be surrounded by thousands of other people who are excited to spend four days listening to a diverse array of artists perform in a decidedly non-indoor environment, thus increasing the risk of heat stroke, dehydration and skin cancer!The bad news is the same as the good news, but you probably don't care because you're still riding high from your wheatgrass smoothie and can't wait to chug a few Bud Lights before Sticky Mop Nixon takes the stage.So stay hydrated. Be nice to other people. And if you need help, go to one of the over-40-year-old people you see standing around looking ridiculous and out of place. They'll know what to do.Although they won't know that Sticky Mop Nixon isn't actually a band.They're so unhip it's a wonder their cargo shorts don't fall off.rhuppke@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "716"}
{"content": "Aug. 01--One of the more notable moments at the inaugural Lollapalooza in 1991 arrived when Jane's Addiction's Perry Farrell joined forces with rapper Ice-T to perform an explicit, button-pushing Sly Stone song.It was a symbolic union of underground rock and gangsta rap, two outlaw genres that found common ground at sold-out amphitheaters across America that summer. It also represented a relative rarity in the early years of Farrell's festival: a hip-hop artist on the main stage. For much of Lollapalooza's early years, rap was a rarity save for token acts such as Ice-T, Ice Cube and A Tribe Called Quest. The album charts reflected rock's dominance that year, with only one hip-hop album inside the top 40 (and a dubious one at that, Vanilla Ice's \"To the Extreme\").But in the decades since, hip-hop has not only surged on the charts, it has become an increasingly larger presence at Lollapalooza, which arrives Thursday (Aug. 2) for its 14th year as a destination festival in Grant Park. Veteran Lolla fans lamenting that the festival \"isn't what it used to be\" are correct. The festival is no longer dominated by guitar-based bands as it was during the alternative-rock era that was the '90s. This year's bill also has a substantial hip-hop presence, a reflection of what's not only selling on the pop charts but also streaming in record numbers on a variety of digital platforms, including Post Malone; Lil Uzi Vert; Logic; Travis Scott; Tyler, the Creator; Gucci Mane; Lil Pump; and Chicago's G Herbo, Valee and DJ Tye.Malone's \"beerbongs &amp; bentleys\" is the year's best-selling album so far, and his song \"Psycho\" is the second most popular on in-demand streams, according to Nielsen Music. Overall, the R&amp;B/hip-hop genre is seeing a 26 percent increase in total album equivalent consumption, an amalgam of sales and streaming data, and widening its dominance as the most-consumed genre (more than 31 percent of total volume). Overall, R&amp;B and hip-hop have expanded their lead over rock, the next biggest genre, to 8.1 percent this year (31.2 percent vs. 23.1 percent) over 3.8 percent last year.This music is most avidly consumed by young people who came of age as hip-hop became synonymous with pop in the last 20 years and as streaming on cellphones became the primary form of music distribution. Lollapalooza reports that 70 percent of its patrons last year were between the ages of 18 and 34, and 62 percent were women -- a 10 percent increase over 2016.The numbers underline that Lolla is drifting away from the rock that built its '90s \"brand,\" and embracing the music of a new generation of potential festivalgoers. Little wonder that the festival played an integral role in the recent rise of dance music in America. It initiated the Perry's stage as a platform for DJs and hip-hop acts when it relaunched in Grant Park in 2005. As EDM boomed in recent years, Lolla was booking the biggest DJs and electronic artists, including Daft Punk, Avicii, Calvin Harris, Kaskade, Bassnectar, DJ Snake and Justice.If that's not your thing, then you're looking in the wrong direction. In many ways, Riot Fest -- which returns Sept. 14-16 to Douglas Park -- has usurped Lollapalooza's position as the premier rock festival in town. The top of this year's lineup -- Beck, Elvis Costello, Incubus, Interpol, Liz Phair, Superchunk -- likely would've played Lollapalooza a decade ago.It's a matter of perspective. At Lollapalooza, those may be perceived as nostalgia acts that mean little or nothing to a good portion of its audience. At Riot Fest, they're legends who can still draw a crowd.Greg Kot is a Tribune critic.greg@gregkot.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "717"}

And even though the Eagles won\u2019t be participating in Thursday\u2019s Pro Football Hall of Fame game, it brings up an interesting topic about which current players have the best chance of earning a spot in Canton down the road.While the Chicago Bears will square off against the Baltimore Ravens on Thursday, Philadelphia still has plenty to cheer about since former players in Brian Dawkins and Terrell Owens will be celebrating their induction into Canton, although the wideout won\u2019t actually be present. One can only imagine what it would have been like to have Owens on the Eagles for a longer period of time if it wasn\u2019t for that fallout, but at least Dawkins will always be considered one of the most respected players in franchise history.As for the current members of Philadelphia with the best chance of joining Dawkins and Owens down the road, well luckily there are a few interesting players to choose from, and it\u2019s one of the main reasons why they\u2019re viewed as an early favorite in the NFC for 2018.

{"content": "Merck and Co. (MRK) can't catch a break. The company fell 1.3% to $63.19 in early morning trading Friday despite beating both earnings and revenue expectations for the second quarter.  Merck's per share earnings came in at $1.06 and revenues totaled $10.5 billion, which both beat Wall Street's expectations. Analysts' estimates for the company's EPS came in at $1.03 while the consensus for revenues was $10.28 billion, according to FactSet. Management also raised its EPS guidance for the rest of the year to a range of $4.22 to $4.30 from its previous estimate of $4.16 to $4.28. Earlier this month, Merck announced price cuts on several of its products, joining Pfizer (PFE) as the only large-cap pharma companies to either halt or cut price increases at least for the immediate future. Pfizer said it would postpone price increases it had implemented July 1 after President Trump tweeted at the company, criticizing them for the decision.  Merck pledged to cut its hepatitis-C drug Zepatier price by 60% alone. Zepatier, one of the company's main products in its virology business, generated $113 million in the second quarter, which was a 13.8% drop from the the same time last year. The company anticipates this trend to continue as the number of patients are expected to decline year-over-year in the future, according to a Merck press release.  SunTrust analyst John Boris doesn't think Merck's decision will affect business because the company has enough legacy brands in its portfolio to generate revenue and has defied the odds by achieving \"top/bottom-line growth\" despite cutting prices in 2017, according to a note Boris wrote. He reiterated his \"buy\" rating on Merck and maintained his price target of $74. Revenues grew 4.3% from the first quarter of 2018 with Mercky's Keytruda cancer treatment and animal health business unit leading the growth. Keytruda sales soared by 89% to $1.67 billion from the same time last year. The immunotherapy drug brought in $881 million the previous second quarter. Keytruda remains Merck's most promising pipeline option as the company continues more launches across different indications. The top indications the company prioritizes Keytruda's use with now are for breast cancer and gastric cancer right now, Adam Schechter, president of Merck's global human health operation, said on the company's earnings call with analysts. \"You really never seen a situation in oncology like what we have right now with Keytruda because this is the first time you have a drug that is crossing so many different tumor types,\" Rob Davis, CFO for Merck, noted. The stock has increased by 13.8% year to date. Over the past year, Merck has outperformed the S&amp;P 500, gaining 14.5% year compared to 3.6% for the S&amp;P 500.", "id": "721"}

{"content": "Earlier this year I spoke to a jailed Russian hacker (we spoke through a verified intermediary) about how he helped Russian security agencies hack Facebook ( FB) , among other U.S. websites and media organizations, according to his account of events.   It's not just accounts of rogue Russian missionaries. The chorus of voices calling out threats to digital security, especially on platforms like Facebook, is growing louder every month.   So far, Facebook has been able to brush them off, telling investors it's handling it.   Until today's second-quarter earnings call, when we're now seeing the impact of revenue growth deceleration.   \"We're investing so much in security, that it will significantly impact our profitability,\" the company said on a call with investors on Wednesday. \"We're starting to see it this quarter.\"   The company's reported $13.23 billion in revenues in the second quarter fell below $13.34 estimate. Still, reported earnings per share were $1.74 compared to $1.32 a year ago.   What rattled analysts the most on the earnings call, however was the \"magnitude of deceleration\" and the executive team's guidance that the operating margin will drop to mid-thirties within a time period of \"more than two years.\"   Facebook's operating margin was 44% in second quarter compared to 47% a year ago.   So what's going on?   CFO Dave Wehner cited currency impact on deceleration, noting a shift from it being \"a tailwind to a modest headwind.\"   All executives also cited fake news, electoral integrity, security concerns as well as investments in new products like video, VR, Stories.   Security headache is here to stay   While the company shares some insights on how they're tackling election machinations, crackdown on political campaigns and identity verification, it's clear it's an acknowledgement of an ongoing cyberwarfare.   \"Security is not a problem you ever solve,\" said Mark Zuckerberg, the company's founder and chief executive who famously started the giant social network and online advertising monopoly in his dorm room. \"We have sophisticated adversaries.\" Facebook doesn't think it's a monopoly.   Last year has been tumultuous for Facebook.   In April, Zuckerberg testified before Congress, revealing there are no easy solutions to regulating Facebook and protecting its users.  During the hearing, Iowa's Senator Charles E. Grassley said the tech industry has a responsibility to protect its users and said \"the status quo no longer works.\"   The company's second-quarter results show that Facebook has taken on that task, even it means rattling investors.   Still, the tone of the management's discussion was upbeat and as idealistic as ever.   The company committed to a five-year goal to help 1 billion people feel less lonely via its groups and communities. It did not share details how privacy of these groups and discussions will be balanced with filtering of politically divisive or racist content.

{"content": "Aug. 02--Eloy Jimenez insists he is as much in the dark about his possible promotion to the White Sox as anyone but feels confident he can do the job when he's called on. The visible proof is Gleyber Torres, who was signed by the Cubs at the same time as him in 2013.Torres was traded to the Yankees in the Aroldis Chapman deal two years ago. Jimenez and Dylan Cease went to the White Sox for Jose Quintana last season.Torres was promoted to New York in late April and has emerged as an everyday second baseman, sometimes even hitting in the middle of the Yankees' loaded lineup. He was batting .289 with 17 home runs, 49 RBIs and .902 OPS through Wednesday.\"Gleyber is a great guy,\" Jimenez said through a translator on a conference call with reporters. \"He was like my brother. We worked together and I'm really happy for him for all the success he's having right now in the majors. I'm pretty sure I can have the same success because I'm a hard worker too.\"When Torres and the Yankees visit Guaranteed Rate Field next week, Jimenez is expected to still be in Triple A, continuing his development and remaining off the service-time clock. He spent time with White Sox general manager Rick Hahn in Charlotte on Wednesday night but says he was left not knowing if he is going to be brought to the South Side when rosters expand in September.\"We just said hello to each other,\" Jimenez said. \"He told me just to keep working hard, keep doing the things I've been doing here. That's it. We didn't talk about anything else.\"Jimenez said he doesn't have any expectations about being promoted even though he has hit .337 with 18 home runs and 59 RBIs with Double-A Birmingham and Triple-A Charlotte this season.\"I'm working to be there this year but if the front office or somebody else doesn't think that I should be there, that is their decision,\" Jimenez said. \"I'm going to be ready for when the opportunity arrives. When God thinks that the time is right, I'm going to be ready.\"The White Sox honored Jimenez as their minor-league player of the month for July. He hit .435 with seven doubles, six homers, 13 RBIs and a .455 on-base percentage over 16 games after recovering from a strained muscle in his left hip.Cease was named as pitcher of the month. He is 11-2 with a 2.71 ERA between high-A and Double-A this season, and went 2-0 with a 1.20 ERA and 42 strikeouts in 30 innings for Birmingham in July.

{"content": "Huawei is apparently planning for a limited-run production of foldable smartphones just to be the first to come up with such a device. It wants to beat Samsung, which is also planning to release a foldable handset. ( David Ramos | Getty Images )Huawei wants to beat Samsung to the punch and release the world's first foldable smartphone, with analysts estimating it could come as soon as early next year.Samsung is currently the world leader when it comes to displays, thanks mainly to its Samsung Display subsidiary, which makes OLED panels for a whole bunch of companies, including Apple.For a while it's been apparent that South Korean electronics brand has been developing a foldable Galaxy smartphone, and its arrival seems pretty close \u2014 just recently, Samsung revealed its \"unbreakable\" display that's been certified for durability.Huawei And BOE To Take On SamsungHuawei wants to compete aggressively. Through flexible OLED panels from Chinese supplier BOE, it's apparently planning to produce a limited run of foldable smartphones, according to Nikkei Asian Review. Most consumers have probably never heard of BOE, but its display business has rapidly grown in recent times. In fact, the company has been tapped to make displays for a bunch of Apple products, including MacBooks and iPads, according to The Wall Street Journal.Huawei Wants To Beat Samsung With The World's First Foldable PhoneIt's typical for Huawei to desire being the \"first.\" In 2014, when rumors came out suggesting Apple was going to use a sapphire crystal display for its next iPhone, Huawei beat it to the punch and released the limited edition Huawei Ascend P7 Sapphire. Apple ended up not using the technology.Huawei was also the first to implement Force Touch technology even before Apple incorporated it into iPhones. It seems Huawei is pulling the same move with regard to foldable technology: accelerate production, release limited units, and technically earn the honor of being the first to come up with such a phone.With this, the race to make the first foldable smartphone is on, but the benefits of such a form factor remains unclear \u2014 besides, of course, the wow factor. Not to mention the potential software-related issues of a phone that can be folded. Both Apple and Huawei would have to develop specialized user interfaces to make intuitive experiences.Smartphones today are already pretty excellent, and it's hard to imagine how foldability would make them even better. Is it another gimmick in the vein of 3D TVs, which are now obsolete? In any case, it seems to be the direction smartphone manufacturers are inching toward, and they have to hope it's the right path forward.Do you think there should be foldable smartphones?

{"content": "Aug. 02--Had Phuoc Thang been born in the United States, the 38-year-old electrician would be quietly raising his young family in their comfy Berryessa home, having turned his life around nearly two decades after serving time in San Quentin for drug possession.Had he been born in Central America or Mexico, he'd likely already have been deported.But because he was born in a refugee camp in Indonesia to Vietnamese parents who fled communism, things are much more complicated. Thang is part of a unique group of hundreds of Vietnamese and Cambodian refugees living in limbo after committing crimes long ago -- some as teenagers -- that cost them their green cards.For years they were allowed to stay in the U.S. anyway, in part because of the unsettled nature of the countries to which they would otherwise be returned. But now, under the Trump Administration's aggressive immigration policies, they've become prime targets for deportation.Many of those immigrants tell similar stories. Feeling isolated in a new country as their parents grappled with the trauma of war, they sought comfort in the wrong crowds early on after settling in America. Some of them joined gangs and committed crimes that got them locked up for years. Now, as grown, rehabilitated men raising families of their own, they're slowly rebuilding their lives outside of prison.Some like Thang have never set foot in their native countries and would be forced to either leave their American-born kids behind or bring them to a place they too have never known.\"Before it wasn't that big of an issue with me,\" he said. \"It was like, if they send me back they send me back. I understand what I did and I'll deal with the consequences. But now I have kids, I can't go back and leave them here with nobody to help support them and raise them.\"Thang's wife, Kat Macaya, a Filipino immigrant, says she knows firsthand what it's like to live in a third world country where there are few opportunities. She doesn't want that for her daughters, Mia, 3, and Audrina, 16 months, who are both U.S. citizens.\"We have all our hopes and dreams here,\" said Macaya. \"We would be starting from zero. I don't want to put that on my kids.\"The sudden surge in ICE activity appears to spring in part from the Trump administration's efforts to deport immigrants with criminal records, even in circumstances where their home countries haven't traditionally cooperated with U.S. removal orders. In the past, immigrants in that situation have been allowed to stay in the U.S., but the Trump administration has been pressing Cambodia and Vietnam, in particular, to take back their deportees.\"Each country has an obligation under international law to accept the return of its nationals who are not eligible to remain in the United States or any other country,\" said a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security in a statement.There were 1,836 Cambodians and 8,585 Vietnamese immigrants in the final stages of deportation living in the United States as of July 23, the vast majority of whom had criminal convictions.Vietnamese and U.S. officials in 2008 signed a repatriation memorandum that in part said Vietnamese immigrants such as Thang who arrived in the United States before 1995 would not be subject to deportation. Activists, however, have said some of the individuals being detained arrived before 1995, leaving them to wonder whether some of these deportations are legal.Thang's family moved to San Jose in the early '80s, where he got into trouble as a teenager, doing drugs and selling them to support his habit.He was arrested on drug and weapon charges in 2001 and pleaded no contest, for which a judge ordered him deported. After serving about a year in San Quentin, Thang -- who also has a 2009 DUI arrest, according to court records -- was transferred to an ICE detention facility in Eloy, Arizona, where he was detained for another six months. Assured by fellow inmates that he wouldn't actually be deported, Thang didn't think to appeal his deportation order at the time, instead returning to San Jose to build a new life with Macaya.Now, he faces deportation to a place he's never even visited.Last year the Trump administration detained about 200 Vietnamese and Cambodian refugees across the country in mass sweeps that activists in this community said they had never seen before. The sweeps have continued this year.Those who support the tougher enforcement point to something they consider obvious -- that any immigrant who has committed a crime doesn't belong in the U.S.\"If you're here in some legal status, it's a conditional agreement,\" said Ira Mehlman, spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which favors stricter immigration enforcement. \"We allow you to remain here to pursue life, liberty and happiness and you agree to abide by the laws of the country.\"Things that people do in their youth, they haunt them and follow them around in many cases.\"Cambodia in 2002 signed a repatriation agreement with the United States which allowed for a certain number of Cambodian immigrants to be deported each year. But only last year did deportations among Cambodians spike to these levels.\"Cambodians are low-hanging fruit,\" said Sophal Ear, a professor of diplomacy &amp; world affairs at Occidental College in Los Angeles. \"Trump sees an opening and is pouncing -- whereas under Obama and previous administrations, there was more finesse; less indiscriminate behavior.\"Borey \"Peejay\" Ai was born in a refugee camp in Thailand to Cambodian parents who fled genocide by the Khmer Rouge regime. The family immigrated to the U.S. when Ai was 5. But growing up in a troubled family in a crime-ridden neighborhood in Stockton, Aistruggled to fit in. As a young boy, he witnessed his 7-year-old cousin get gunned down in the infamous Cleveland Elementary School massacre of 1989. Five children were shot to death.Seven years later, he was the one pulling the trigger. At 14, Ai pled guilty to second-degree murder in the 1996 slaying of a Berryessa liquor store owner during a robbery, becoming one of the youngest people in California to be given a life sentence for murder .He served 20 years in San Quentin and was granted parole in 2016. But on the day he was freed, ICE was waiting outside.Ai spent nearly two years at the Rio Consumes detention facility in Elk Grove. He's appealed his deportation order and has asked Gov. Jerry Brown to pardon his crime, which could eventually allow him to stay in the United States.But even as Brown -- who last year pardoned Cambodians Mony Neth and Rottanak Kong, convicted of possessing stolen guns and felony joyriding, respectively -- weighs this decision and as Ai's case sits in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, he could be deported at any minute.\"It's devastating,\" said Ai. \"It hurts. There's no way to describe it. I can't get comfortable, I can't do anything because I know that at some point it can be gone. It can be taken from me.\"During his time in prison, Ai became a state certified counselor for domestic violence victims through a group called Guiding Rage into Power, which gave him a job after his release. He's worked extensively with Kid CAT, a rehabilitative program at San Quentin acclaimed for its focus on self improvement through education and counseling. Both Ai and Thang are part of the Asian Prisoner Support Committee in Oakland, which works to rehabilitate former convicts as they re-enter into society.Ai was raised in the system, he said, and is asking for a second chance.\"I realize I made poor choices in my life,\" Ai said. \"I know I could never take back what I've done but I'm trying my best to give back to my community, to make amends and be accountable for my crime.\"\"All I'm asking for is an opportunity to live life right. To redeem myself as a human being.\"___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "727"}
{"content": "July 28--REDDING -- By Saturday evening, the fire had burned more than 80,900 acres and was only 5 percent contained, according to Cal Fire. The blaze had consumed nearly twice as much acreage overnight from Friday to Saturday as it had in the previous five days.Even the most experienced firefighters battling the blaze were astounded by its intensity. Cal Fire spokesman Steve Crawford said he hasn't seen anything like it during his 30-year career.\"This fire is burning in every direction all at the same time,\" Crawford said at a press conference Saturday afternoon. \"Even though we have multiple resources, the way it's burning ... is as if it has a Santa Ana wind or a strong 60 mph, 70 mph wind behind it.\"The fire claimed additional human lives. Melody Bledsoe, 70, and her two great-grandchildren, aged 5 and 4, perished inside their home in Redding, now charred to rubble, according to family members who spoke to multiple media outlets. The three had been missing since Thursday night when the fire swept through their suburban neighborhood on the west side of Redding.Investigators were examining a house in that neighborhood Saturday for fire victims, confirmed Shasta County Sheriff's Capt. Pat Kropholler. It took time for investigators to get on scene, he said, because active gas lines at the homes in the area were fueling flames all day.Bledsoe, 5-year old Emily Roberts and 4-year old James Roberts were three of five killed by the fire so far. Two firefighters have also died, authorities confirmed: Redding fire inspector Jeremy Stoke, 37, and 81-year-old Don Ray Smith, a bulldozer operator.The blaze has destroyed 500 structures and threatens nearly 5,000 more in Redding and nearby towns; Shasta County Sheriff Tom Bosenko said the current tally of destroyed buildings is \"probably higher\" than 500. More than 3,400 firefighters have been combating the fire day and night.On Saturday, President Donald Trump issued an emergency declaration for California, allowing counties fighting wildfires to receive federal assistance and for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to provide equipment and resources with the mission \"to lessen or avert the threat of a catastrophe in Shasta County,\" according to a statement from FEMA. The National Guard has been helping with fire suppression and support, according to a Cal Fire official.Bill Roche, Deputy Regional Administrator for FEMA's Region IX, which includes California, has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for response operations in the Carr Fire.Hot dry weather with triple-digit temperatures was forecast around Redding for the remainder of the weekend, according to Cal Fire. With gusting winds and low humidity, the weather conditions and the dry vegetation \"still have the potential to fuel fire growth,\" officials said.Terrifying lessons from the Wine Country fires -- How to prepare for a wildfire in your neighborhood (Video)The fire, which pushed against the western part of the city of Redding and prompted an order to evacuate 38,000 residents, continued Saturday to move southwest of Redding toward the towns of Igo and Cottonwood.Evacuation zones expanded throughout the region. At 11 a.m. Saturday, CalFire ordered mandatory evacuations in the community of Happy Valley, located 10 miles southeast of Igo. By 12:30 p.m., CalFire ordered additional evacuations on Buell Road and Platina Road on Ono, another small town southwest of Igo. CalFire advised residents south of Platina Road to evacuate to Highway 36. And around 1:30 p.m., Win-River Casino on the southern end of Redding evacuated its guests and employees, according to the Record Searchlight.Four evacuation centers have been set up in Redding and Weaverville, west of Redding. Shasta College reported Saturday that they were fully occupied. Simpson College President Normal Hall told KRCR that he expected his college's evacuation center to be fully occupied by the end of Saturday.The Red Cross opened two shelters, and local churches have volunteered to provide shelter and amenities for those who left their homes due to the fire.Residents living in Happy Valley experienced wildfires as recently as last month. Suebee Semore was forced to evacuate for five days in June when a wildfire charred the rural area around her house on Cloverdale Road.Semore didn't evacuate on Friday or Saturday during the Carr Fire, but watched from her house as the neighboring areas evacuated and flames filled the area with thick smoke, as they had in June.Her house and the already burned land around it seemed safe from the Carr Fire on Saturday, but the devastation nearby was astounding, she said.\"I've seen wildfires,\" said Semore, who has lived in the area most of her life. \"But I've never seen anything this big.\"Semore is no stranger to the risk of fire. In 2014, a fire burned down this house. She had tried to hold off the flames with a hose, but ultimately had to get out. And the more recent June fire touched right up against her property, burning part of the fence. She was coming back from vacation when that fire struck, prompting her to unload her car, load up her animals and leave her house.Fire crews from multiple agencies were stationed around Igo -- an unincorporated area with a population over 600 -- overnight and through Saturday morning. Firefighters and bulldozers worked to keep the blaze away from homes and ranches in the area.A crew was setting backfires to keep a fire from spreading to a home and then pulled out the hose to slow down the flames. A bulldozer cut fire breaks to help prevent the fire from blazing through the vegetation.Nearby, crews struggled to keep the fire at bay. Officials told the Record Searchlight that the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Bridge on Clear Creek Road in Igo is \"compromised\" due to the fire.Cal Fire told the Record Searchlight that firefighting air tankers from throughout the state would fly missions on Saturday as conditions allow and 17 helicopters have been assigned to the fire.However, at the press conference Saturday afternoon, a Cal Fire official said aircraft missions have been limited due to the heavy smoke and haze limiting the pilots' vision.Check back for updates.___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "728"}
{"content": "RIDGEFIELD \u2014 Beer drinkers might soon be able to grab a snack on their way out of Route 7\u2019s Nod Hill Brewery, thanks to a new ordinance that will let the business apply to have one or more food trucks in its parking lot.  The new rule \u2014 approved almost unanimously by more than 50 voters in a town meeting this week \u2014 creates an exception for breweries and wineries to a 2016 rule that does not allow mobile food vendors in one spot for more than 15 minutes, except for two food trucks that were grandfathered in.  It was sent to a town meeting after nearly 400 residents, or more than 2 percent of voters, signed Nod Hill Brewery\u2019s petition, which requires the town to hold a vote on the proposal.  Supporters argued the food truck option would help the popular brewery continue to attract business to Ridgefield.                              \u201cWe are an integral part of the town and we want to continue to be that way for a long time,\u201d co-owner Robert Kaye told the crowd Wednesday. \u201cThis will help.\u201d  The ordinance allows breweries and wineries to apply for permits for food trucks as long as they only operate on that property and during the \u201cgeneral hours\u201d of the business.  Some selectmen and residents worried the \u201cgeneral hours\u201d language was too vague or that the food trucks could create parking problems. But Kaye agreed to say on the record at the meeting that the truck would not stay on the property after the business closes, except maybe for a short time to break down.  First Selectman Rudy Marconi said, as with any business, the police department would handle any parking problems.    One nearby restaurant owner said he worried the food truck would unfairly draw customers away from other businesses.  \u201cRight now the way I see it, it benefits one party and it will hurt every brick-and-mortar business on that street,\u201d he said.  Others, though, argued that the brewery and food truck will attract different customers than a sit-down dining experience. Some said, too, that helping Nod Hill be successful means more business for the town as a whole, since it will draw customers from other towns into Ridgefield.  \u201cWe should do whatever we can to encourage a new business and let the market dictate,\u201d one resident said. \u201cIf the food trucks don\u2019t make money, they go away.

{"content": "Current free agent wide receiver Dez Bryant has been linked to the Cleveland Browns, but his recent Twitter rant proves the team should look elsewhere for helpA lot has been said about the Dallas Cowboys and Dez Bryant since he was released by the team back in April. He has also been tied to several teams that could use help at the position, most recently being the Cleveland Browns.With uncertainty surrounding Josh Gordon, it makes sense to see if there\u2019s a veteran out there who can help. Looking at things in a bubble, Bryant very could be a great addition. He\u2019s an experienced receiver who commands attention from defensive backs and is good for a miraculous play every couple weeks or so.As evidenced by his recent Twitter rant though, he\u2019s also just one step away from blowing up. After hearing that some members of the team were glad he wasn\u2019t at camp, Bryant unloaded on his former franchise.Todd Archer of ESPN recounts the exchange in which Bryant called team owner Jerry Jones \u2018clueless,\u2019 called out some of the most respected members of the team for him being released and referred to linebacker Sean Lee as a \u2018snake.\u2019Putting aside whether or not Bryant is correct, it\u2019s a terrible look. For a guy in need of a job, the best approach would seem to be trying to prove the negative talk about him is incorrect. Instead, he went out and advertised that he truly believes the problems in Dallas were due to everyone but him.Nothing can hurt a locker room more than someone refusing to take ownership while constantly passing blame. And as for calling Jones \u2018clueless,\u2019 this was shocking as Jerry Jones seems to be the one guy who truly is upset that Bryant is no longer there. This means even his biggest supporter isn\u2019t immune to his short fuse.Cleveland right now has some young talent on their offense like quarterback Baker Mayfield, tight end David Njoku, running back Nick Chubb and receiver Antonio Callaway. These guys can use solid vets to look up to like quarterback Tyrod Taylor, running back Carlos Hyde, quarterback Tyrod Taylor and wide receiver Jarvis Landry.None of these guys have left previous teams only to throw everyone under the bus. They have instead focused on being better in the future and building a strong, unified team. Bryant wouldn\u2019t share that vision and his recent explosion is further confirmation.", "id": "731"}
{"content": "Aug. 01--PHOENIX -- When Giants executives Brian Sabean and Bobby Evans have analyzed their pieces and evaluated options, the front office duo has almost always devised aggressive strategies and often used maneuvers that led to endgame domination.This year, with a .500 club and long playoff odds in front of them, Sabean and Evans sat down at the table before standing up to spectate. For the first time since 2013, the Giants did not execute a deadline trade and instead opted to see if their current roster has enough left in the tank to challenge for National League West supremacy.What will the next two months look like in San Francisco? Our Giants beat writer, Kerry Crowley, answered readers' questions.Who are the Giants going after in waivers? (From Saul in San Francisco)Crowley: It's unclear whether the Giants will look to buy or sell on the waiver wire in the month of August as the team's performance over the next two-to-three weeks will likely dictate the direction the franchise takes.If the Giants do look to add pieces, expect the front office to pursue starting pitchers, relievers or corner outfielders under team control for the next few seasons. Sabean said the Giants aren't looking at free agents-to-be to help the club and are instead monitoring the market for young starting pitchers.One name that makes sense is Cincinnati's Matt Harvey, who will assuredly be placed on waivers and could help a starting staff that's been decimated by injuries.With Johnny Cueto all but gone in 2019, who do you see the Giants bringing in to fill that role? (From Justin in San Mateo)Crowley: If Johnny Cueto's elbow injury does require Tommy John surgery, the Giants will be forced to consider adding at least one established starting pitcher this offseason. With Dereck Rodr\u00edguez and Andrew Su\u00e1rez under team control for five more years, the Giants will have the financial flexibility to look at veteran free agents like Gio Gonzalez and Patrick Corbin.However, after watching older pitchers including Matt Cain, Jake Peavy, Johnny Cueto and Jeff Samardzija break down in recent years, the Giants will be motivated to trade for young starters and may be forced to part with top position player prospects to fill the potential void left if Cueto is out for all of next season.San Francisco should also look to re-sign Derek Holland, who is enjoying his best season in years under the guidance of pitching coach Curt Young.The Giants stood pat at the deadline. Do you think that's a sign Brian Sabean is testing the team? (From Bob in Hollister)Crowley: The Giants' quiet deadline is due to a combination of factors, but Sabean did tell reporters it's imperative to continue evaluating the current roster entering another pivotal offseason for the front office.Contracts for Sabean, Evans and manager Bruce Bochy expire after the 2019 season and the front office needs to see what this current core is capable of over the final two months of the year before determining an offseason strategy. The Giants have dealt with several devastating injuries, but that's a peril of fielding a club loaded with veterans.With Brandon Belt set to return shortly and Joe Panik ready to resume playing every day, Sabean and Evans are eager to see if a mostly healthy roster can play up to the expectations set in the offseason. If the Giants fall out of the race, the front office will be more compelled to shake up the team before 2019.Is there a chance Joe Panik will lose his job to Alen Hanson or Chase d'Arnaud? Has he peaked? (From Jan in the Czech Republic)Panik is hitting under .240 for the second time in three seasons and is once again battling injuries that have kept him out of the lineup for a significant portion of the year. Because he's the only member of the team's core who is still arbitration-eligible, he'll also be viewed as an attractive asset to other clubs if the Giants consider trading him this offseason.If the Giants do believe acquiring pitching help can be accomplished through an offseason trade, it wouldn't be a surprise to see Panik's name floated in discussions. Hanson is younger and more athletic than Panik and d'Arnaud, and he won't be a free agent until 2023.Could you see the front office shutting down some of these young arms in the next couple weeks? The Nationals did it with Strasburg while in a playoff race. (From Mike in Sutter, CA)Though the Giants haven't given any indication they plan on limiting the workload of Andrew Su\u00e1rez and Dereck Rodr\u00edguez in the coming weeks, this will be a topic of conversation if the team falls out of contention.Su\u00e1rez threw 155 innings in 2017 and has already logged 124 innings across two levels this year, while Rodr\u00edguez is 30 innings shy of his career-high for a minor league season. Both pitchers look capable of handling increased workloads, but expect the Giants to use off days to their advantage in August and September and allow for additional rest for both pitchers between starts.What more does pitching prospect Tyler Rogers have to do? (From Christina in San Francisco)Rogers was the Giants' 10th round pick in 2013 and is on his third season pitching for the Triple-A Sacramento River Cats. He was named an All-Star in each of the past two years and owns a 1.61 ERA in 41 games this season.The Giants might be skeptical of how Rogers' arsenal will translate to the major leagues because he's a submarine-style pitcher, but at this point, there's absolutely no reason to hold Rogers back in September. If the Giants don't add Rogers to the 40-man roster this offseason, he'll be claimed in the Rule 5 draft and they'll have wasted a chance to see if he can help.Do you think the Giants will re-sign Madison Bumgarner after his contract is up? (From Andrea in Scottsdale)Unless the Giants reach an agreement to extend Bumgarner this offseason, this question will loom over the franchise throughout the 2019 season.It's difficult to envision Bumgarner pitching in any other uniform, and the fan base's love for Bumgarner is something CEO Larry Baer understands well.Is it financially prudent for the Giants to spend another $100-plus million on a pitcher with nearly 1,600 innings on his arm? Probably not. But if there's any player the Giants will do it for, Bumgarner is the obvious choice. My gut tells me Bumgarner and Buster Posey will never wear another jersey.Is there a starting pitcher in Double-A or Triple-A that could be the next Andrew Su\u00e1rez? (From Joe in San Francisco)Right-hander Shaun Anderson was acquired in the Eduardo N\u00fa\u00f1ez trade last July and was recently promoted to Triple-A. Like Su\u00e1rez, the folks who rank prospects aren't obsessed with Anderson, but he clearly has the potential to break into the Giants rotation and help the club as soon as next season.If the club needs another arm in September, the Giants may even look at Anderson this year. However, the middle of 2019 appears like a realistic time for Anderson to break into the big leagues.___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "732"}
{"content": "July 27--Steve Heminger, the executive director of the Metropolitan Transportation Commission, announced Wednesday that he will end an 18-year reign by retiring early next year.It can't come soon enough.The region's freeways are gridlocked. Public transit systems are in disarray. Commute times continue to increase. Heminger touts his agency as \"action-oriented and project-based,\" but that has translated into piecemeal construction, pathetic planning and a lack of long-range vision. The agency merely hands out money for one politically popular project after another with little sense of where it will all lead.Meanwhile, Heminger flew around the world on top-priced airline tickets at public expense; deceived the public and flouted the law to use bridge toll money to fund his badly overbudget quarter-billion dollar regional government building on prime downtown San Francisco real estate; and masterminded his agency's hostile takeover of the staff of the Association of Bay Area Governments.The Bay Area deserves better in what is arguably the most important job shaping the region's transportation and housing. The time for a road project here, a rail extension there and tax increases wherever they can be found is over.We should stop building on far-flung open land regardless of whether there's public transportation to service it. We can't keep counting on new freeway improvements to get the rapidly growing workforce to and from its jobs.We must be smarter. We need a leader with vision, supported by empirical data, to ensure workers can afford to live in the Bay Area and get to their jobs in a reasonable time.MTC board members will ultimately select Heminger's replacement. But, under the terms of the hostile takeover two years ago, the members of ABAG will have advisory input.The person picked should be able to facilitate the still-to-be-completed merger of the transportation and housing-focused agencies and lead them toward a critical, symbiotic working relationship. For we can't solve the region's transportation problem without adequate, smartly located housing. And, conversely, smart housing depends on strong public transit.The person selected should bring the experience and skills to unify residents and businesses behind a sustainable plan for the Bay Area's transportation and housing for decades to come.That person should be recruited nationally, and bring a fresh, outside perspective. Heminger was an inside hire, promoted after his boss, Lawrence Dahms, retired in 2000. Between them, they have run MTC since 1977.Which helps explain why Heminger treats the agency like his fiefdom. While he officially reports to the commission board, the roles are often flipped. The 18 voting board members, mostly city or county elected officials, worry first about securing money for their locales. That means remaining in Heminger's good graces.He's leaving now. It's time for the commissioners to step up, to show leadership -- to make one of the Bay Area's most critical government hires. For the sake of Bay Area residents and the region's economy, they need to get it right.___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "733"}
{"content": "DALLAS, TX \u2013 JUNE 22: General Manager Jeff Gorton of the New York Rangers looks on from the draft table during the first round of the 2018 NHL Draft at American Airlines Center on June 22, 2018 in Dallas, Texas. (Photo by Brian Babineau/NHLI via Getty Images)The New York Rangers\u2019 general manager, Jeff Gorton, has continued to set the team up for long term success with smart moves.In professional sports, success and failure both trickle down from the top. If a team has terrible ownership, it does not take long for the dysfunction to make it to the arena. Ask New York Met fans if they would take James Dolan over Fred Wilpon and how quickly they would forget about how abysmal the Knicks have been for more than two decades.In the case of the New York Rangers though, Dolan wisely knows he is out of his depth. Instead of meddling in the team\u2019s affairs and installing hack yes men in positions of power, Dolan has left the Rangers alone. The team\u2019s owner wisely hired Glen Sather as the team\u2019s President and GM before the 2000 season. Although the first half of Sather\u2019s tenure was an abysmal flop, the NHL lockout allowed the Rangers to reset.Following the lockout, Sather and the scouting department drafted well and built a team over time. Quality players like Ryan Callahan, Brandon Dubinsky, Marc Staal, Derek Stepan, Carl Hagelin and Chris Kreider all came to be Rangers under Sather\u2019s tenure. With a salary cap restricting his ability to sign over the hill free agents, Sather improved drastically.Following the 2015 season in which the Rangers won the President\u2019s Trophy, Sather stepped down as GM and then Assistant GM Gorton was promoted.", "id": "734"}

{"content": "When the traded for Tavon Austin this offseason, did they envision pairing him with Cole Beasley to give opposing defenses nightmares?When the drafted North Carolina receiver Ryan Switzer in the fourth round of the 2017 NFL Draft, some analysts were confused by the selection. As one of the most prolific special teams returners in college history, his role as a specialist was clear.But Switzer did not seem to fit a role on the Cowboys offense as the 5-foot-8, 185 pound was clearly a slot receiver. And Dallas already possessed one of the top slot receivers in the NFL in Cole Beasley. Switzer simply appeared to be a Beasley-clone.The result was the young slot receiver saw very limited snaps on offense his rookie year and he was traded to the Oakland Raiders this offseason for defensive tackle Jihad Ward.Then Dallas did something a bit strange. They traded for another slot receiver in former first-rounder Tavon Austin, from the Los Angeles Rams. After parting ways with Switzer, bringing in Austin seemed like a similarly inept move.But Austin brings another dimension to Dallas than Switzer could provide. That being one of a dynamic playmaker who can line up in multiple positions including running back. In fact, early rumors were that the Cowboys intended to use Austin as a wed/change of pace back to spell starter Ezekiel Elliott.Instead, the Cowboys have used Austin exclusively at wide receiver this offseason. And despite his slight 5-foot-8, 179-pound frame, that includes using him on the outside. In fact, Dallas has also been experimenting with putting the similarly-sized Beasley on the outside as well. There have actually been plays where both diminutive receivers have lined up on the outside at the same time.Here\u2019s what Cowboys offensive coordinator Scott Linehan told NFL.com\u2019s Gregg Rosenthal about this unique duo just last week.\u201cThere could be three plays in a row where Tavon lines up in three different positions. I think [Austin and Beasley] add very effective matchup potential together with us. It\u2019s proven. Not just like he\u2019s done it in college. We\u2019ve seen him do it in the pros.\u201dDespite their lack of size, it\u2019s their quickness and speed that could make Tavon Austin and Cole Beasley a lethal combination in Dallas next season. The Cowboys are clearly experimenting with new ways to open up their passing game. Perhaps they\u2019ve just discovered the next dynamic duo in Big D. Regardless, the combo of Austin and Beasley should be fun to watch.", "id": "739"}
{"content": "July 27--NAPA -- Gruden was animated (shocker!) and right back at home after six weeks away from his whole team. Asked if he had any flashbacks to his first training camp go-round with the Raiders, he joked, \"I did when I saw Jerry walk up,\" referring to our own veteran Raiders beat man Jerry McDonald.\"My role at the beginning of practice is to let the assistant coaches do the fundamentals, a lot of the techniques that we're coaching,\" Gruden said. \"I had a hard time standing and watching, but it's just awesome to be here ... I know I have a lot to prove and I'm eager to do the best I can to do it.\"The Raiders' best player, Khalil Mack, obviously wasn't in attendance amid his current contract holdout.The Raiders proceeded with Day 1 nonetheless, and here are 10 things to know from opening day in Napa.1. Who's on the first-team offensive line?With Donald Penn on the physically unable to perform list to begin camp, rookie Kolton Miller is seeing first-team snaps at left tackle. As expected, Kelechi Osemele, Rodney Hudson and Gabe Jackson are manning the inside while 32-year-old Breno Giacomini starts at right tackle for the time being. The Raiders' offensive line took a step back in 2017 after a dominant 2016, and they'll need better showings from the tackle spots to return to that level.You know Osemele, Hudson and Jackson will always play like one of the best interior offensive lines in the league. Left tackle remains a big question mark with the 35-year-old Penn still recovering from December Lisfranc surgery and Miller having yet to play in a NFL game. On the other side, Giacomini lacks in pass protection, and young tackles Brandon Parker (a rookie) and David Sharpe (second year) are unproven. One of those three will start at right tackle, where the Raiders need something far better than what Marshall Newhouse gave them a year ago.\"Tom Shaw and the training staff have done an excellent job with our young linemen on both sides,\" Gruden said. \" ... Offensive tackles, we need a lot of work in that area and so far we're very pleased.\"Miller may have the most eyes on him of any player at camp given his first-round billing and potential need to step in at Derek Carr's blindside right away. The Raiders took him 15th overall in April's draft for a reason. Especially with Penn sidelined for the time being, the spotlight will shine brighter on the youngest member of a unit hoping to return to its old ways.2. Bruce Irvin already causing havocOn Friday alone, Irvin recorded an interception and a forced fumble, shouldering the responsibilities of the defensive line's leader without Mack in attendance.Irvin easily picked off EJ Manuel and took it the whole way, finishing his pick-six with a backward fall into the end zone and airborne crotch grab a la Marshawn Lynch's from his Seahawks days. Irvin also forced a Lynch fumble, which the defense recovered, teasing Lynch by playfully punching him after he lost the ball.Irvin hasn't been shy about his excitement switching to defensive end. He's publicly stated his preference of getting after the quarterback instead of dropping back in coverage, and made a goal of reaching double-digit sack totals for the first time in his career. If Friday's strong start was any indication, we might see an even more dominant Irvin in 2018.\"Bruce Irvin's playing his natural position on an every-down basis,\" Gruden said. \"I think he's a heck of a player.\"3. Each quarterback throws an interception on Day 1It wasn't the best day for Oakland's signal-callers. First Shaquille Richardson picked off Connor Cook over the middle. Then Irvin plucked a terrible Manuel pass out of mid-air and took it the whole way. Then Tevin Mitchel, a 2017 practice squad defensive back, snagged a Carr pass on the sideline. Maybe Mitchel didn't get both feet down before tumbling out of bounds, but it'll certainly be talked about like an interception in the quarterbacks meeting room.It's no secret Oakland's QB play was subpar to say the least in 2017. Carr tied his single-season career high with 13 interceptions, seven more than he threw in 2016. Manuel lost the only game he played and Cook, the only quarterback on the roster with playoff experience, didn't see a single snap. The Raiders better hope Carr doesn't go down again because Cook and Manuel (currently in that order) constitute a sizable drop-off from No. 4.Even so, Carr needs to be miles better if the Raiders want any chance at the playoffs.\"I can't say enough about him,\" Gruden said of his starting quarterback. \"He's special. That's all I'll say. I couldn't be more pleased. I've worked with a lot of great quarterbacks in the past, but this man is as into football as any guy I've met. And he's talented, man. And smart.4. How defensive line shook out without MackThe Raiders' first four defensive linemen during team drills without No. 52 were Tank Carradine (filling in for Mack), Irvin, Mario Edwards Jr. and Justin Ellis.Edwards Jr. seems like he'll play defensive tackle instead of defensive end this season, and Ellis is back as a hole-plugger after re-signing on a three-year deal in the offseason. Maurice Hurst will see plenty of time, too, as the staff is sky high on the rookie fifth-rounder from Michigan. Gruden loves third-rounder Arden Key from LSU and he looks to be the third or fourth defensive end behind Mack, Irvin and maybe Carradine.The Raiders ranked last in the NFL with 14 sacks through 10 games at the time of Ken Norton Jr.'s firing and finished tied for 24th with 31 sacks after John Pagano took over. With a happy Mack after he's paid and a rejuvenated Irvin, among others, the Raiders are hopeful those numbers will make a jump in 2018.5. Timetable for Penn, P.J. HallHall hit the PUP list with an undisclosed injury earlier this week, which Gruden confirmed Friday to be a pectoral strain. The head coach said his rookie second-round defensive tackle will be out a couple days before returning to action. Penn, who we knew was still recovering from foot surgery, will be back \"soon,\" Gruden said. Gruden wants his incumbent starting left tackle to prove he can swiftly change direction on a day-to-day basis before he returns to the field.6. Mack, Alexander placed on reserve/did not report listWe knew Mack would end up on this list, but Vadal Alexander's presence on it is unexpected. The third-year guard/tackle is suspended for the first four games of the regular season for violating the league's policy on performance-enhancing substances, but that doesn't mean he's suspended from camp or preseason action. Both players don't count against the 90-man roster.7. How the secondary lineup looked at first glanceIn 7-on-7 drills, the first four defensive backs on the field were Gareon Conley and Rashaan Melvin at cornerback, with Karl Joseph and Reggie Nelson at safety. New Raiders Marcus Gilchrist and Leon Hall slid into the slot position early in drills, and Gilchrist's versatility may allow him to start at safety this season, too.I know what you're thinking: How can the Raiders start a 34-year-old Nelson at safety after his performance last season. Answer: he knows Guenther's defense from their time in Cincinnati, and that gives him a leg up at the start of camp. Who knows if he stays in that leading role come Week 1. Daryl Worley and Dexter McDonald were the second set of outside cornerbacks, with Shareece Wright also seeing time in the slot.8. Play of the dayI think I have to go back to Irvin on this one. We know he prefers putting his hand in the ground as opposed to dropping back in coverage, but his interception came when he...you guessed it, dropped back in coverage.

{"content": "For women who undergo a c-section, it can be challenging to recover from the surgery and regain your figure after delivering a baby. C-sections are surgical deliveries of babies that can limit your mobility for several weeks following the procedure. Many women need assistance with feeding the child or performing daily activities as they heal.One of the most common challenges that come after having a cesarean section is losing the baby weight. Due to a lack of physical activity and the pain or discomfort that is involved, it can be challenging to lose weight. Fortunately, there are a few ways you can shed the excess pounds and feel more like yourself.     Here\u2019s how to lose weight after having a c-section:Use a Support BeltOne of the most useful products for c-section weight loss is a postpartum support belt that can ease discomfort and will offer support on loose abs and where the incision is located. The product is effective in compressing the uterus, which can make it shrink over time. It can also be used to help the muscles recover.The support belt can be used as you recover for six weeks before you can become more mobile again. While wearing the belt, perform isometric abdominal contractions that include squeezing and holding your abs for 10 seconds before releasing. Performing repetitions of the contractions will firm the stomach as you work to lose the belly fat.     Eat a Clean DietThe diet that you eat after undergoing a caesarian section will prevent you from gaining more weight as you practice a sedentary lifestyle while recovering. It will also allow you to provide your child with more nutrients while breastfeeding. Increase your intake of fruits, vegetables, nuts, lean meat, and legumes. Avoid cutting your calories, which can affect how much breastmilk you produce, making it necessary to consume 300 to 500 more calories each day. Avoiding processed foods will also allow you to naturally shed as much weight as possible for c-section weight loss.Stay HydratedStaying hydrated is necessary after undergoing a c-section, which can combat belly fat if you\u2019re drinking enough water during the day. Studies also show that drinking less water is correlated with obesity, making it essential to sip on water instead of snacking too much. If you want added flavor, consider adding strawberries or cucumbers to infuse the water. Avoid consuming sugary drinks or beverages, which can increase the number of calories that you consume and can result in dehydration.Continue Breastfeeding the BabyAlthough many women resort to feeding their child formula as they recover, it\u2019s important to continue breastfeeding as long as possible to continue losing weight. Breastfeeding will allow you to burn an average of 300-500 calories each day without much effort involved.     Begin MovingAlthough it can be challenging and uncomfortable to begin moving when recovering from a c-section, you\u2019ll need to become more active to lose weight. Start by performing gentle exercises that aren\u2019t overly strenuous in the comfort of your home. Perform exercises that help to build your core muscles, which will not only lead to weight loss but will increase your recovery time. Walking, bridges, and water exercises will all prove to be effective when you begin to exercise throughout the week. Allow yourself to take a day or two off to ensure your muscles have time to rest.Performing yoga will also prove to be effective six to eight weeks after the c-section, which will allow you to become more flexible and stronger. The stretches are gentle and can be performed at home to ensure that you don\u2019t push yourself too hard while staying active. Pelvic tilts are also necessary to regain the strength in your abdomen, which can be performed while lying down or standing.Perform a Safe DetoxYou can detox safely after undergoing a c- section to boost your kidney and liver function naturally. Although many detoxes can leave you malnourished, there are ways of doing it effectively to ensure you can continue to breastfeed your child. Detoxing will require you to drink plenty of water throughout the day and consume plenty of organic whole foods and vegetables, which can flush toxins in the body. Drinking lemon water, dandelion tea, ginger tea, and honey water will also prove to be beneficial. Excess toxins that are flushed out of the body can flatten the stomach quickly and will reduce bloating.Although it can be challenging to start your weight loss journey after having a baby, there are ways to do it effectively and safely as you continue to breastfeed. With the right steps taken, you can shed excess weight and feel healthier as you recover from a c section.", "id": "741"}
{"content": "Aug. 02--There's a virtual reality room that allows quarterbacks to watch 3-D film on a screen large enough for drive-in movies. An outdoor lounge where players can nap to the sound of Lake Michigan's crashing waves. A massive weight room that can accommodate all 110 players at once.\"Like going from the Bates Motel to the Ritz-Carlton,\" said Jay Hooten, Northwestern's director of sports performance for football.Yes, NU's new Walter Athletics Center is spectacular. A ribbon-cutting ceremony Wednesday for donors marked NU's rise from the worst football facilities in the Big Ten to some of the best in the nation.But here's what alums are wondering: Will this section of the $270 million Ryan Fieldhouse actually help the Wildcats rise to the top of the Big Ten standings? Northwestern has been winning at a nice clip, producing three 10-win seasons since 2012. But the last conference title, a share of it anyway, came in 2000.Here are five reasons to think that the new facility, described by the Tribune's Blair Kamin as a \"distinguished, sometimes-breathtaking, work of architecture\" will have value beyond the obvious wow factor:1. Time-saverForget about the romance of towering glass walls and million-dollar views. The Walter Athletics Center is all about efficiency. From the moment the players complete practice either indoors or at the neighboring fresh-air field, they enter an area with cubbies to place down their helmets and then stop at a nutrition hub (aka \"fueling station\"), where snacks are arranged to be grabbed in order, left to right.NCAA rules limit in-season athletes to 20 hours per week of required activities, so it's a race against the clock. Before Ryan Fieldhouse and the Walter Athletics Center were built, players had to be shuttled a mile and a half from campus toward Ryan Field.NU officials estimate a daily savings of 22 minutes, though NU coach Pat Fitzgerald said after the first day of workouts, \"it felt like we got an hour back.\"2. Pump you upThe joke was that after NU enhanced its weight room in the mid-'90s, it went from the worst in the Big Ten to the worst in the Big Ten. Now? It's the greatest Gold's Gym you've ever seen. The \"performance center\" is 13,000-square feet. And by the way, \"The Walt\" also has a jaw-dropping 14,000-square foot weight room for \"Olympic sport\" athletes -- lacrosse, field hockey and cross-country, plus men's and women's soccer and swimming and diving.Hooten said the \"functionality\" of the new football space allows him and his staff to break up the team into four groups to maximize their strength-training.The \"freaks\" like Rashawn Slater, who started 12 games on the offensive line as a true freshman, use resistance apparatus -- bands and chains. Group 2 is on the \"power program.\" Group 3 contains the \"young bucks\" who focus on volume lifts. The newbies start slower, learning the basics.\"We have it all,\" said Hooten, who joined the program in 2009. \"This was the missing piece of the puzzle. The morale is at an all-time high right now.\"And Hooten, borrowing a line from athletic director Jim Phillips, promised this: \"Our motto is: We're a white-collar school keeping that blue-collar mentality.\"3. Care to join us?You're more likely to see a great white shark in Lake Michigan than a 5-star recruit on NU's practice field. Even 4-star signees are rare. That might change. Fitzgerald's office is modest but next door is a lounge with the feel of a living room with views of NU's outdoor practice field, Lake Michigan and the Chicago skyline.\"Being in the backyard of Chicago speaks for itself,\" Fitzgerald said.Rivals.com recruiting analyst Josh Helmholdt predicted in 2016 that the facility will help attract high-level recruits for campus visits, and CBS Sports Network recruiting analyst Tom Lemming put it like this: \"The three things kids mention to me most: How many players you're putting into the NFL, facilities and girls. Parents do look at academics, especially if you're a Northwestern-type kid.\"4. To your healthNU's locker room contains a giant cold tub that can fit 40 players and a hot tub that perhaps could accommodate, but will not, an entire cast of \"The Bachelor.\"A technologically advanced sports medicine center has specialized tables and stations for water and \"cardio\" therapy to promote recovery. NU basketball player Barret Benson popped in Wednesday, saying: \"It's incredible to see the effort, time, resources and top technology have been put into this amazing building.\"NU's basketball teams still will practice in or near Welsh-Ryan Arena, but Benson said the new on-campus facility is a \"hub\" for weight-training, meals, academic services and career-path advice.5. An NU lifer?The most important figure in NU football is Fitzgerald, who turned down Michigan in 2011 after mega-donor Pat Ryan committed to fund this A-through-Z lakefront facility. \"Fitz Mahal,\" is what quarterback Clayton Thorson calls it.Fitzgerald and Phillips toured 64 pro and college football facilities and incorporated their favorite design elements. Three examples: The locker room contains a smaller space to be used by NU alums in the NFL; the 188-seat meeting room/auditorium can be split in half at the touch of a button, so offensive and defensive players can remain seated, saving time; the linebackers and defensive line meeting rooms have adjoining doors, allowing coaches to flow from one to the other.With a salary believed to be approaching $4 million (and generous salary pool for assistants), supportive administrators and donors and now a facility to be envied by every coach in America, Fitzgerald has everything he needs to build a powerhouse program.tgreenstein@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "742"}

However, it turned out that the structure might actually be the oldest known public library in the country. ( Gerhard Gellinger | Pixabay )An ancient library believed to have contained as many as 20,000 ancient scrolls have been unearthed in the middle of Cologne, Germany.Archeologists had discovered the walls of a Roman-era structure last year, which they initially thought was the ruins of a public assembly hall. However, they found that the tiny wall niches were far too small to hold statues.It made them think twice: what if the assembly hall is actually the country's oldest known library?When A Public Assembly Place Turns Out To Be A Library\"It took us some time to match up the parallels \u2014 we could see the niches were too small to bear statues inside,\" according to Dirk Schmitz, from the Roman-Germanic Museum of Cologne, as The Guardian reports. \"They are very particular to libraries \u2014 you can see the same ones in the library at Ephesus.\"It is unclear just how many scrolls the library is believed to have held, but experts say it would have been quite huge, and Schmitz says 20,000. The actual building would have been slightly smaller than the library at Ephesus, which was erected in 117 AD.It was quite fortunate that the niches were intact when archeologists discovered the walls, according to Schmitz. Had they unearthed only the foundations, they would not have been able to tell that it was a library. He adds that there could be a lot more libraries in Roman towns just waiting to be excavated.An Ancient Public Library In Cologne(Photo: R\u00f6misch-Germanisches Museum der Stadt K\u00f6ln | K\u00f6lner Stadt-Anzeiger)Evidence shows that the library in question was used by the public, according to Schmitz. For one, it stood right in the middle of Cologne, either in the marketplace or forum: the public space of the city center. What's more, it's built with strong materials \u2014 and such buildings, because of their massive size, were public places.It was built sometime between 150 and 200 CE, says Martin Oehlen of German news outlet K\u00f6lner Stadt-Anzeiger. The city of Cologne was founded about a century earlier in 50 CE. It served as the capital of the Germania Inferior province and housed some of Rome's influential imperial governors. Cologne soon became a center for trade and manufacturing.The library was discovered while conducting construction work on a Protestant church in Cologne's city center, according to Oehlen. It will be integrated into the new building's underground garage, with two planned parking spaces instead of displaying the structure's walls and three niches.", "id": "743"}
{"content": "Quantum scientists found that time does not always move forward after all. At the quantum level, time can move forward and backward, which means it is also true at the level of the rest of the universe. ( Pixabay )Pioneering research into quantum computing reveals time moves forward and backward, upending much of what we know about the nature of time.A team of quantum physicists at the National University of Singapore has found that time behaves differently in quantum computing models. They say what is true at the quantum level is true for the rest of the universe as well.What Is Causal Asymmetry?It is pretty obvious to everyone that time always moves forward, never backward. It makes sense as 7:00 rolls into 7:01, Monday into Tuesday, and middle age into senior years and finally to death.This understanding of time also applies to classical computers, which store information as either one of two states, 0 or 1. It is far less challenging for computers to figure out what will happen to the system in the future than to predict what happened in the past based on the information it has in the present.This is called causal asymmetry, the idea that a system needs fewer resources to move forward than backward. In the real world, it is widely known as cause and effect. One thing happens now that results in another thing in the future. What happens in the future cannot affect what happened in the past.Information theorists have long assumed that causal asymmetry is a fundamental property of the universe. In 1927, astrophysicist Arthur Eddington proposed that causal asymmetry is the reason why time moves forward, not backward.Think of the universe is a massive cosmic computer. It requires far less information to move forward in time than backward. The cause happens before the effect, not the reverse.No Causal Asymmetry In Quantum ComputersIn a study published in Physical Review X, the team of quantum scientists challenge the prevailing theory of causal asymmetry. The new paper explains how the linear movement of time into the future could be a relic of the bygone era of classical computing.Using theoretical quantum computers, the researchers found that causal asymmetry does not exist in quantum models. They say that what applies to a quantum computer also applies to massive objects in the universe.Quantum physics is the study of very small particles exhibiting strange behaviors that are not obvious on the bigger level. What is true for quantum particles is also true for massive objects, even when our limited tools keep us from actually perceiving these behaviors.This means that, if causal asymmetry does not exist at the quantum level, it also does not exist for the universe.How Quantum Computers WorkUnlike classical computers, quantum computers store information in subatomic particles that can exist in more than one state at a time. Both quantum and classical computers can easily predict what happens in systems that are either very orderly (such as a pendulum) or very random (such as a gas-filled chamber).The researchers looked at systems with just the right amount of disorder and randomness, such as weather systems. They found that quantum computers studying these systems were able to go forward and backward without using up more memory than going in a single direction.\"While classically, it might be impossible for the process to go in one of the directions [through time], our results show that 'quantum mechanically,' the process can go in either direction using very little memory,\" says Jayne Thompson, complexity theorist and quantum physicist at NUS.The researchers point out that their discovery does not mean there is zero causal asymmetry at every point in the universe. Thompson says it is possible that a quantum model exists that demonstrates causal asymmetry.The team hopes to find out if they can devise models where this phenomenon exists.", "id": "744"}

The rumored 6.1-inch LCD iPhone will apparently come in never-before-seen colorways such as flash yellow and bright orange. ( Justin Sullivan | Getty Images )When the iPhone 5c was released in 2013, it was criticized for being too pricey and too lacking in cutting-edge features. Even still, it introduced never-before-released colorways for the iPhone line, albeit in a cheaper-looking plastic material.Since then, there have been no follow-ups and instead of going for a more experimental approach with colors, Apple only released safe color variants such as Rose Gold, Jet Black, Space Grey, and other similarly muted colors. Needless to say, it is time to change things up a bit.2018 iPhone Colors, According To MacotakaraA new report says the company will release new color variants for the 6.1-inch LCD iPhone that's supposedly coming this year. Ming Chi-Kuo, a trusted Apple analyst, first gave this tidbit earlier this month and now, Macotakara is corroborating that Apple will indeed release the LCD iPhone in new colors.However, Macotakara's report disputes what colors will be available. Originally, Kuo said that the LCD iPhone will come in gold, grey, white, blue, red, and orange. Meanwhile, Macotakara says it will come in black, white, gold, and most surprisingly, Flash Yellow, Bright Orange, Electric Blue, and taupe, which is supposed to be gray with a tinge of brown.Macotakara does not mention a red iPhone variant like Kuo did. However, it is possible Apple will save that variant for a mid-year release as it did with the iPhone 8 Product RED.Regardless of which prediction ends up being accurate, it is nice to see that Apple is making more experimental color variants of the iPhone again. It makes sense because the iPhone 5c was Apple's lower-tier iPhone and the 6.1-inch variant supposedly will be the same thing.New iPhonesApple is rumored to launch three new iPhones this September, two of which are premium options with OLED displays, and the other one being a low-cost alternative, which is the 6.1-inch LCD variant in question. It is not clear whether the other two options will also come in a variety of colorways, but that is not likely. Apple might retain the iPhone's more muted colors for those options, seeing as they are the more expensive models.Who do you think is right \u2014 Macotakara or Kuo?

{"content": "With two games before facing Boise State, Oklahoma State football has some time to figure out whether or not Spencer Sanders is the answer at quarterback.Oklahoma State football has a lot of potential for the 2018 campaign, but the program also has a lot of question marks. A young and talented roster with a new key part of the coaching staff can create a lot of uncertainty. The Pokes lose out on one of the best quarterbacks in the Big 12 and one of the best statistical pass throwers in the nation in Mason Rudolph (who currently resides on the roster of the Pittsburgh Steelers).The quarterback competition for Oklahoma State under head football coach Mike Gundy will revolve around four options. Those four options are senior Taylor Cornelius, junior John Kolar, sophomore Keondre Wudtee, and true freshman Spencer Sanders.As a former four-star dual-threat quarterback prospect out of the Dallas, TX, area, Sanders might be the most talented of the four options. However, he\u2019s also the most inexperienced and raw option. Cornelius got some valuable experience last season and even Wudtee took some game snaps. Kolar has been around the program for three years now so he\u2019s become acquitted to the process.We don\u2019t have to look too far back to when Gundy went with a true freshman under center and it worked out well. Gundy had to burn Rudolph\u2019s redshirt in 2014 after injuries ended the seasons of both J.W. Walsh and Daxx Garman. Rudolph won two of his final three games of the season in 2014, including a key victory in Bedlam over the Oklahoma Sooners.For the next three seasons, Rudolph led the Pokes to double-digit win totals on each occasion. Although, that 2014 season that Gundy had trouble finding the answer under center saw the team win just seven games. Gundy needs to find the right answer from the get go. A very tough non-conference contest lies ahead against the Boise State Broncos in September.At Big 12 Media Days, Gundy gave a glimpse into the current state of the quarterback competition saying that Cornelius is Oklahoma State\u2019s \u201cguy\u201d entering fall camp. That leaves Sanders\u2019 outlook for immediate playing time in the dark as of now.However, if Cornelius can\u2019t convert as the starting quarterback this fall, Sanders will be waiting for his opportunity. This quarterback situation has quite a few similarities to that of the 2014 season. Garman and Walsh were the experienced options, but maybe not the most talented.Sanders is the highly touted four-star quarterback prospect that might not get the opportunity to start right away. Rudolph was in the same shoes back in 2014 and led Oklahoma State to one of its most consistent periods of success in program history. Sanders could be looking at a very similar to that of Rudolph with Oklahoma State football back in 2014.", "id": "748"}

However, Amazon is not Facebook, and Jeff Bezos is not Mark Zuckerberg, at least not on this day. Amazon missed expectations for revenue (still +39.4% year-on-year) you say? Amazon crushed expectations for profitability, I say. It would be easy to say that the real story is Amazon Web Services. After all, AWS is top dog in the still rapidly expanding business line simply known as \"the cloud,\" but performance was strong across the entire firm. I could throw a lot of numbers at you, which would bore you and cause you to go read something else, so I'll just leave you with this. operating income. This print hit the tape at $3 billion. Last year, this number was $678 million, and guidance for this quarter stood at a lofty $1.73 billion. Crushed it.  In addition to AWS, strength was seen in Subscription Services (Prime, etc.), and Third Party Sellers -- who pay the firm a commission. Moving forward for the third quarter, the firm's own guidance again seems to be just a little below consensus view for revenue -- but also, again, well above consensus for operating income. One thing is certain. While old-school retailers might still look at Amazon as a \"Death Star\" willing to spend just so it might take market share, that this is now a well-rounded corporation that has, over years, made the jump from cash burn to highly profitable, and on expanding margins across nearly all business lines.

Sellers in the San Jose region made average gains of 116.6 percent when they sold their homes -- the highest of 147 metro areas analyzed. San Francisco was second, with sellers making average gains of 85 percent.Wannabe homeowners who experience sticker-shock when looking at Bay Area prices have two options, said real estate agent Homa Saleh of Keller Williams, who mostly represents buyers in the San Jose area.\"I tell them just wait. If you can't find a property that's in your budget, I wouldn't go too much above asking price because it might not appraise,\" she said. \"Or go for properties that may need a little bit of work.\"Blomquist credited the spike in Bay Area prices to the increase in the number of sales over $1 million, $2 million and even $5 million.In the San Jose metro area, the median sale price for a single-family home or condo last quarter was $1.2 million, according to ATTOM. In the San Francisco metro area, it was $925,000.But overall, U.S. home prices are increasing more slowly than in the past. The national median sale price for a home or condo was $255,000 in the second quarter of this year -- that's up 6.3 percent from a year ago, but it marks the slowest annual appreciation since 2016.Eighty of the 122 metro areas studied saw their median home prices grow more slowly last quarter, including Los Angeles, Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston and Philadelphia.Not surprisingly for those who have been keeping track of sale prices in the Bay Area, San Francisco was one of 42 metro areas analyzed that bucked the trend, seeing appreciation accelerate faster than the previous quarter. New York, Washington, D.C., Boston and Detroit also made the list of outliers. Despite it's sky-high year-over-year appreciation, the San Jose area's prices actually grew more slowly last quarter than the quarter before.Bay Area homeowners also are holding onto their properties longer than those in other parts of the country. The average seller in the San Jose area had been in the home 10.6 years before selling, and the average seller in the San Francisco area had been in the home 10.5 years, compared to a national average of eight years.\"People are just staying put longer and not selling,\" Blomquist said. \"It's also contributing to the lack of inventory for ... homebuyers who might otherwise move into those homes.\"___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "751"}

However, it\u2019s hard to imagine anyone trusting Verizon again after its many blunders. ( Paul J. Richards | AFP/Getty Images )Verizon has announced that it's going to offer a VPN service for mobile devices. It's called Safe Wi-Fi, and it will cost $3.99 a month.The service will only be available to Verizon customers using iOS and Android smartphones and tablets, however. Each account with Safe Wi-Fi can enroll up to 10 devices in total. The carrier is also offering a free 30-day trial for anyone interested.How To Avail Verizon's New VPN ServiceTo avail the service, customers just need to log into their My Verizon app, and go the \"Products and Devices\" section. There, scroll down to reach the new \"Safe Wi-Fi\" option. According to The Verge, the feature didn't appear during its test, even though the app has been updated to the latest version. Perhaps Verizon is still in the process of rolling it out to all users.Verizon's VPN comes with a built-in ad blocker as well, although it's unclear if that means ads will be blocked on sites such as Yahoo or AOL, which are both owned by the carrier.Why Customers Might Think Twice About VerizonThe offer certainly sounds tempting, but it's easy to imagine that many will skip this considering Verizon's tendency to frustrate users by introducing constraints that greatly impact user experience and satisfaction.For example, Verizon customers once fumed at the carrier because it was discovered to be deliberately throttling YouTube and Netflix well before users even hit their 22 GB throttling limit. Another source of frustration is the fact that its unlimited plans change constantly. Just this past June, it unveiled three new \"unlimited\" plans that weren't actually unlimited at all.Sure, throttling probably won't be a problem with the Safe Wi-Fi service since the VPN will be based on Wi-Fi, but customers may still feel hesitant trusting a company known for suddenly introducing changes that often don't make sense and sometimes even seen anti-customer.That being said, $4 a month seems pretty decent considering what other companies charge for VPN. By contrast, ExpressVPN, a popular choice on Android, costs nearly $7 per month \u2014 and that's if users pay for 15 months upfront. As The Verge notes, it'll probably appeal to families who travel a lot, especially in countries that require VPN, including China, Cuba, or Saudi Arabia.Thoughts about Verizon's VPN offer? Do you trust the carrier enough to use another one of its services? As always, if you have anything to share, feel free to sound them off in the comments section below!", "id": "752"}
{"content": "The newest possible quarterback answer for Notre Dame football comes with freshman four-star standout Phil Jurkovec who has massive potential.Notre Dame football should be more excited about the former four-star quarterback recruit Phil Jurkovec than any other player at his position on the roster. Brandon Wimbush and Ian Book have both put on display the obvious potential issues that would come about by either getting the nod under center for the Fighting Irish.This is a decision for head Notre Dame football coach Brian Kelly that will impact the entirety of the 2018 campaign. The starting quarterback will determine whether this experienced Notre Dame defense can help maximize the potential of the offense, or if that side of the ball will have too much pressure to deal with.Notre Dame brings back one of the most experienced defenses in the nation and a host of talent on the offensive side of the ball. Some departures at the skill positions and along the offensive line means that the offense has more question marks than the defense entering the 2018 season.It doesn\u2019t seem to matter how experienced the offensive starters are for Notre Dame to ultimately find success through a grueling schedule. That includes the quarterback play that was seen last year from both Book and Wimbush. Book was the x-factor to the Irish knocking off the LSU Tigers in the Citrus Bowl to cap off the 2017 campaign nicely.In 2018, Jurkovec could be the force that powers the Notre Dame offense to the next level. We\u2019ll have to see if Kelly has the trust in Jurkovec to give him some starts early in the regular season.Here\u2019s a look at the path to freshman quarterback Phil Jurkovec and how he could contend for the Heisman Trophy with the Notre Dame Fighting Irish.", "id": "753"}
{"content": "Aug. 02--Had it not been for three errors, Cole Hamels might have been allowed to provide quantity as well as quality Wednesday night in his Cubs debut.But with reinforcements such as Brandon Kintzler to fortify a fatigued bullpen, the Cubs gladly accepted a nine-strikeout performance from Hamels in only five innings.Possessing a fastball in the mid-90 mph range and an effective changeup, Hamels provided the Cubs with much-needed optimism as they coasted to a 9-2 victory over the Pirates.\"A great first start,\" Cubs manager Joe Maddon said.He added Hamels' changeup and curveball looked as sharp as they did when he beat Maddon's Rays in the 2008 World Series and when he pitched a no-hitter at Wrigley Field in 2015.Hamels will pitch on bigger stages than the PNC Park mound, but the sharpness on many of his pitches validated the observations President Theo Epstein and his staff made before deciding to surrender two pitchers and a player to be named or cash to the Rangers for Hamels on Friday.\"All year my changeup has been horrendous,\" said Hamels, who was 5-9 with a 4.72 ERA in 20 starts with the Rangers. \"I think that was the focus I had these last couple of weeks, to get back to what I know was comfortable. The reason I made the league when I was so young, was my changeup.\"Hamels' changeup more than compensated for a 95 mph fastball that occasionally lacked command, but the Cubs envision more polished starts after Hamels cooled off a Pirates team that lost for only the fifth time in its last 21 games.\"We got some thoughts from watching him,\" Maddon said. \"He's really easy to speak to. I'm looking forward to this. I think you're going to see he's very capable of getting on a nice roll with high end stuff.\"Hamels allowed three hits, his second lowest total this season, and his nine strikeouts were his most since he struck out 11 in five innings against the Athletics on April 3 in his second start.Shortstop Addison Russell's throwing error on Pirates leadoff man Jordan Luplow in the the first led to Francisco Cervelli's two-out RBI single during a 27-pitch inning. But Hamels pitched at a brisk tempo the rest of the way.\"This team is awesome,\" said Hamels, who was the beneficiary of a four-run first. \"They have some great guys, the young personalities, and the veterans keeping a good team morale, and the energy is up.\"That's something you fully enjoy. When games matter, everybody is focused and having a good time. You lose, they know how to bounce back and keep it positive, and when they win, it's much sweeter.\"Kintzler, acquired from the Nationals an hour before Tuesday's non-waiver trade deadline, hired a personal driver to take him 41/2 hours to PNC Park, and Maddon didn't hesitate to use him for 11/3 innings.\"For any contending team to ever want you is a privilege,\" Kintzler said. \"I don't take that lightly, either. A couple of years ago I could barely get a minor-league job, and now I've been on two contending teams.\"As I get older, the window gets shorter to get in the World Series, so I'm here to do whatever I can and play my part.\"The large lead enabled Maddon to employ demoted Tyler Chatwood in relief, and Chatwood gave up a single and a walk in pitching a scoreless ninth.mgonzales@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "754"}
{"content": "Many are expecting the UCLA football team to have an effective, uptempo offense under Chip Kelly, but it will be nothing if the defense isn\u2019t top-notch.UCLA football head coach Chip Kelly gave a lot of information at Pac-12 Media Day, despite being a man who doesn\u2019t like to reveal his secrets. Although it was mostly answering questions broadly to appease the large crowd of reporters who were interested in what the coach who had finally returned to college football had to say.But among everything he said, one comment really stood out. It had to do with his perception of the importance of defense.\u201cOne thing that people don\u2019t realize or maybe just kind of glossed over is when we were really good at Oregon is because we were really good on defense.\u201dKelly knew that he had to have a balance between both the offense and the defense for the entire team to be successful. That is something that has been missing from the UCLA football program the last several seasons.For example, in the last few years, UCLA ran a very conservative defense which did not fit well with the offense they were trying to run. With Josh Rosen and the offense scoring or turning the ball over in a short amount of time, it did not give the defense enough time to recuperate on the sideline.In the last few years, UCLA has not done well in time of possession. In 2018 they averaged 26:29 minutes with the ball while their opponents had it for 33:31. That is not exactly taking control of the game.This is something that Chip Kelly has deliberated on over and over. His philosophical stance is not just to run the ball down his opponent\u2019s throats and score at breakneck speed, but he needs a defense that can keep up with the amount of time the offense is on the field.So far, this is exactly what we\u2019re seeing with UCLA under Kelly. In the spring, it was quite apparent that the offense was going to need some time to get up to speed, but the defense seemed to catch on a lot quicker. This is going to help UCLA improve during the time Kelly gets his offense up to speed.UCLA is not going be conservative in any way. There will be none of this \u201cbend-but-don\u2019t-break\u201d mentality. They are going to be aggressive, attacking, and violent. Defensive coordinator Jerry Azzinaro wants his players to get after the ball. If they miss it on one play, they will try to do it again on the next. They might give up some big plays, but they will also make so effective stops with their aggressive style.The mentality of the defense will be to get after the ball and get it back into the hands of the offense as quickly as possible so that they can do what they do. With the defense leading the way, we should eventually see Kelly\u2019s plan come to fruition. This is his plan, and even though it will take time to develop, it will be something to behold.", "id": "755"}

That means the regular season is right around the corner. The depth at outside linebacker remains the team\u2019s biggest concern. The good news is that general manager Ryan Pace still has time to address it.Currently, Leonard Floyd and Sam Acho are slated to be the team\u2019s starters. Floyd could very well put up double-digit sacks if he stays healthy all 16 games. Acho is a nice player and he does things on the football field that sacks can\u2019t necessarily measure. Still, you don\u2019t want him starting.Behind them are Isaiah Irving, Kasim Edebali, Andrew Trumbetti, Aaron Lynch, Kylie Fitts and Elijah Norris. Lynch is the most proven out of any of them, but he\u2019s been hurt three times already this offseason. Once he returns from this hamstring injury, can he stay healthy all season?Despie being a sixth-round draft pick, Fitts has shown a lot of potential rushing the passer thus far in training camp. Talent was not the issue for why he was drafted in the later rounds. Rather, it was his injury history. Well, that trend seems to have followed him to the Bears as he\u2019s currently out with a shoulder injury.If Edebali, Trumbetti, or Norris have to see meaningful time in the regular season, the Bears are in trouble.The good news is that with it being the preseason, players on other teams are going to be cut and trades are going to be made.

{"content": "July 27--The White Sox won the home run derby Thursday but still lost to the Angels 12-8.The Sox hit six home runs on a warm afternoon, five of them solo shots off Angels starter Nick Tropeano and a two-run blast from Jose Abreu in the ninth off reliever Blake Parker. Abreu hit two (16) as did Daniel Palka (14), with Avisail Garcia (11) and Nicky Delmonico (2) also joining the trot fun. Garcia, Palka and Delmonico hit home runs in a four-batter span of the seventh that cut an Angels lead to one at 6-5.The Angels countered with three home runs, the first two shots from Kole Calhoun in the first and Ian Kinsler in the fourth. The third one was a crusher. After closing to 6-5, reliever Juan Minaya allowed a single and walk to put two on for catcher Francisco Arcia, who was making his major-league debut. The rookie clubbed his first hit and homer in the majors to push the lead to 9-5. The Angels would go on to batter the bullpen and push their lead to 12-6 before Abreu's consolation homer in the ninth.\"The ball was traveling well,\" manager Rick Renteria said in an understatement. \"It was a hot day and balls got out of here fast. I don't think I've ever been in a game where our first five hits were solo home runs.\"Starting pitcher Dylan Covey (4-6) had an experience Thursday similar to teammate James Shields on Wednesday. It was a 3-2 game when he ran into trouble in the fifth. With two outs, he gave up singles to Justin Upton (four hits on the day) and Albert Pujols and then a triple to Andrelton Simmons into the left-field gap. Simmons scored on the play when there was no one backing up home on Tim Anderson's relay throw home.\"It was pretty hot but you just have to deal with that,\" said Covey, who gave up just two hits in 8 1/3 innings in beating the Mariners 5-0 Saturday. \"I didn't have my best stuff, but there were a couple of situations (in the fifth) where I needed just one pitch to get out of the inning and get the team in the dugout.\"Upton's single came on a 2-2 fastball and Pujols' single was a first-pitch blooper to left.

{"content": "Following the trade of Carmelo Anthony the star\u2019s comments on poor fit highlight his inability to accept his own regression.From the minute the OKC Thunder made the trade to bring Carmelo Anthony to the OKC Thunder most of the TI staff weren\u2019t optimistic. Sure, it was entertaining, especially with summer hoodie Melo all the rage and opining on the OK3. There were optimists who felt if Melo was willing to play the type of ball which made him the most decorated Olympic basketball team member it could pay dividends. Yet, ultimately, that\u2019s all it was a fun exercise in what could have been.With the experiment over it\u2019s time for refection. Anthony deserves credit for never once displaying his dissatisfaction throughout the season. In fact, it wasn\u2019t until Game 5 of the Thunder\u2019s first round series that anyone suspected he might not be anything other than happy.Anthony took heat for reacting to not getting back on the floor for most of the 25 point comeback win. He was vilified for his playoff defense and his inability to hold his tongue in the exit interviews. When he took to social media to rub in the fact he opted in to his $27.9 million payday he was unceremoniously roasted for it.Fit wasn\u2019t there:Yet, instead of being angry at Carmelo Anthony perhaps OKC fans should be giving the forward a break. Examination of the facts warrants at minimum some empathy. Diving into his recent comments offers perspective on why the 15 year veteran left OKC unfulfilled. Anthony spoke to ESPN\u2019s Jemele Hill shedding light (for the first time) on his opinion why things went south in OKC.\u201cAt the end of the day, it wasn\u2019t a good fit,\u201d he said. \u201cI think last year \u2014 and I haven\u2019t talked about this before \u2014 everything was just so rushed, going to the team for media day and the day before training camp. Them guys already had something in place, and then I come along in the 25th hour like, \u2018Oh, s\u2014, Melo, just come on and join us. Like, you can figure it out since you\u2019ve been around the game for a long time.\u2019 That\u2019s why it was so inconsistent. At times I had to figure it out on my own, rather than somebody over there or people over there helping me.\u201dMelo is 100 percent right \u2014 he was not a good fit with the Thunder. It\u2019s often said players will resort to their natural instincts under pressure. It\u2019s for this reason youngsters are pushed to develop good fundamentals and habits early. It\u2019s also why younger players are more desirable additions.With 15 years under his belt asking Melo to change his iso skills to primarily spot up for catch and shoot actions was likely too much of a stretch. Forgetting his abysmal defense, it can\u2019t be said Melo didn\u2019t try.Trade benefited everyone:With his Hawks trade the best result occurred for all parties. The Thunder dramatically cut their luxury tax and removed a player who didn\u2019t fit the system. Most importantly, this was achieved without having to waive Anthony and pay for an empty asset over the next three years.As for Anthony, he gets the best of all worlds too. His $27.9 million contract will be paid in full by the Hawks. This comes with the added bonus of freedom. To that end, Melo can isolate which squad\u2019s system is best suited to him, pick the role he\u2019ll play and do so at the destination of his desires.Melo\u2019s reservations:Anthony is annoyed by the heat and criticism generated from one poor season. Yet, in truth his regression over the past few seasons was progressive. This wasn\u2019t a sudden shock, nor was it an unfair assessment of his skills. Despite protestations to the contrary Melo has been hit by something he can\u2019t control \u2013 aging.Well known analyst and former NBA player Charles Barkley favorite saying is fitting in this instance. When it comes to basketball, no one beats father time. \u2018Some can point to his draft class and good friend LeBron James who is defying those odds. But, James is the exception, not the norm. Undoubtedly the 34 year old Anthony can still score and contribute. That fact was never in question.SeasonAgeTmGMPFGFGAFG%3P3PA3P%2P2PA2P%eFG%TRBASTPTS2012-1328NYK6737.010.022.2.4492.36.2.3797.616.0.476.5026.92.628.72013-1429NYK7738.79.621.3.4522.25.4.4027.515.9.469.5038.13.127.42014-1530NYK4035.79.020.2.4441.54.5.3417.415.7.474.4826.63.124.22015-1631NYK7235.17.918.2.4341.54.3.3396.413.8.463.4747.74.221.82016-1732NYK7434.38.118.8.4332.05.7.3596.113.1.466.4885.92.922.42017-1833OKC7832.16.115.0.4042.26.1.3573.98.9.437.4765.81.316.2Career105435.98.619.2.4491.33.7.3477.415.5.473.4826.53.024.1Generated 7/28/2018.At issue is the role Carmelo Anthony should be playing at this stage of his career. Run through the teams and scan the players who produce off the bench. Melo could dominate most teams off the bench. Depending on the squad he could be surrounded by defensive specialists. He might not be a top 15 player any longer, but surely his skillset and scoring prowess would place him in the upper tier if not at the very top of the reserves list.Houston \u2013 we have a problem:Unfortunately, Anthony refuses to consider the reserve option, feeling it is beneath his abilities. Assuming he lands on the Rockets this could prove as a deterrent for Houston. They\u2019ve already lost two key defensive contributors with Trevor Ariza and Luc Mbah a Moute leaving.\u201cI know how to play this game of basketball,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been playing it for a long time. When I feel like I\u2019m ready to take that role, then I\u2019ll take that role. Only I know when it\u2019s best for me to take that role. I\u2019m not going to do that in a situation where I still know my capabilities and what I can do. And at the end of the day, the people who really matter know my capabilities and what I can still do. You start getting to the media and debates, it\u2019s going to always be kind of back-and-forth.\u201dThe core starters are Chris Paul, James Harden and Clint Capela. Presumably the Rockets intend to put Anthony in one of the forward roles, but if he has issues guarding fours then threes are out of the question. In essence his presence in the starting rotation for Houston would put extreme pressure on recently re-signed Capela and whoever is inserted to play the other forward role.The Iverson comparison:Carmelo isn\u2019t the first player to struggle with accepting his diminishing skillset. And, arguably for superstars the regression is harder. Their entire lives centered around being \u201cthe man\u201d as the primary scorer and delivering wins in the clutch.Much like the natural progression of growing up basketball emulates this. Players enter the league relying on talent and athleticism. Each successive year the game slows down for them. What naturally transpires as the player relies more heavily on thinking the game and using their wiles to score as opposed to pure athleticism.The problem for Melo is he happens to be aging in an era where the game has sped up. Complicating matters is this generation relies on ball movement and perimeter shooting more than ever. None of these elements are cornerstones of Melo\u2019s game. Rather, Anthony is an isolation ball player who prefers the midrange.The player who comes to mind is Allen Iverson who was an MVP and superstar. Iverson spent his first 12 seasons in Philadelphia as their star. When he was traded to Denver it sent shock waves through the Association. Sadly, his regression was swift and in many circles it was felt he still had plenty to offer, if only he would move to the bench. At issue was his refusal to move to the bench.SeasonAgeTmGGSMPFGFGAFG%3P%2P%eFG%FT%ASTSTLPTS1996-9721PHI767440.18.219.8.416.341.448.467.7027.52.123.51997-9822PHI808039.48.117.6.461.298.494.486.7296.22.222.01998-9923PHI484841.59.122.0.412.291.440.439.7514.62.326.81999-0024PHI707040.810.424.8.421.341.435.446.7134.72.128.42000-0125PHI717142.010.725.5.420.320.441.447.8144.62.531.12001-0226PHI605943.711.127.8.398.291.419.422.8125.52.831.42002-0327PHI828242.59.823.7.414.277.440.436.7745.52.727.62003-0428PHI484742.59.123.4.387.286.408.412.7456.82.426.42004-0529PHI757542.310.324.2.424.308.451.453.8357.92.430.72005-0630PHI727243.111.325.3.447.323.465.467.8147.41.933.02006-0731TOT656442.58.920.2.442.315.465.466.7957.21.926.32006-0731PHI151542.710.124.4.413.226.444.429.8857.32.231.22006-0731DEN504942.48.618.9.454.347.473.480.7597.21.824.82007-0832DEN828241.88.719.0.458.345.482.488.8097.12.026.42008-0933TOT575336.76.114.6.417.283.435.434.7815.01.517.52008-0933DEN3341.06.013.3.450.250.500.475.7206.71.018.72008-0933DET545036.56.114.7.416.286.432.432.7864.91.617.42009-1034TOT282430.94.911.3.430.360.436.445.7944.00.713.82009-1034MEM3022.35.08.7.5771.000.560.596.5003.70.312.32009-1034PHI252431.94.811.6.417.333.425.431.8244.10.713.9Career91490141.19.321.8.425.313.448.452.7806.22.226.7Denver traded Iverson to Detroit which was the beginning of the end. Following portions of three seasons as a Nugget AI was traded to Detroit. Iverson played 50 games (of 54) as a starter, but bristled at suggestions of coming off this bench. This led to his trade to Memphis where he played just three games prior to a trade back to his NBA home in Philly where he finished his career. Had Iverson been able to overcome his reservations it\u2019s likely his career would\u2019ve been extended potentially another three to five seasons.Notably, the fall off of Iverson\u2019s game was swift beginning around his 13th season. Melo may be producing still, but the similarities are palpable. Like Iverson, Anthony refuses to see how he could extend his career and still be a valuable producer off the bench.The question moving forward is whether Carmelo Anthony will be able to come to terms with accepting this role. For the OKC Thunder they\u2019re happy to not have that issue to deal with. Moreover, if Anthony ends up signing with the Rockets the move may serve to help OKC move ahead of Houston.Let\u2019s see how it plays out.", "id": "760"}

{"content": "Aug. 02--The acquisition of Chicago protein bar company RXBar continues to pay off for cereal giant Kellogg.Kellogg bought the River North-based company last fall for $600 million, a hefty price tag that conveyed both the potential that Kellogg saw in RXBar and also Kellogg's desire to grow beyond its core business, which has suffered as Americans eat less cereal.\"It's doing extremely well,\" Kellogg CEO Steve Cahillane said of RXBar on a conference call with analysts Thursday after the release of the company's second-quarter results. \"We're very, very pleased with the acquisition and very, very pleased with the team and how we can grow it in such a special way.\"The acquisition was one of Cahillane's first moves after being named to the top job in October.RXBar contributed $59 million in sales to the company during the second quarter, Kellogg said, and $110 million in the first six months of the year.Kellogg said RXBar expanded distribution and took a bigger slice of the protein bar market during the spring quarter, and accounted for nearly all the sales growth in a a segment of Kellogg goods that includes U.S. frozen foods like Eggo waffles and Morningstar Farms meatless products, Kashi, and the company's Canadian businesses.Strength in that segment offset declines in snacks and morning foods. The snacks category includes products like Pringles and Rice Krispie Treats, and morning foods include cereals such as Frosted Flakes and Pop Tarts.Cahillane said RXBar is the fastest-growing brand in the protein bar category, and has held on to a \"passionate consumer base.\" But he promised that the company is \"not at all complacent.\"A kid's line of bars and new nut butters should drive further growth, he said, and Kellogg also plans to expand sales into Europe for the first time later this year.\"We like where it can go,\" he said.Kellogg now expects companywide sales this year to increase by 4 to 5 percent, compared with a previous estimate of 3 to 4 percent growth.sbomkamp@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "762"}

{"content": "Aug. 04--As reporters and admirers swarmed Chicago mayoral candidate Willie Wilson at the Cook County Building recently, a woman and her son stood near the elevators headed to the second floor. That's where they would pick up a check from Wilson's charity to help offset their property tax bill.\"It's a blessing,\" said 80-year-old Arlener Donaldson who has owned a two-story home in the Englewood community since 1979. Wilson's foundation would be giving her $500 toward her property taxes, which were a little less than $1,000. On a fixed income and raising foster kids, Donaldson manages her finances by juggling.\"I just let some things go until I pay the taxes,\" she said, keeping an eye on the elevators. \"After I pay the taxes, I catch up with the other bills like the water bill and the gas bill and stuff like that.\"Easing the pressure of property taxes on homeowners should be a top priority of the next mayor of Chicago and governor of Illinois. A recent study by ATTOM Data Solutions, one of the nation's largest analysts of property tax data, found that Illinois residents pay the second-highest property tax rates in the country, behind New Jersey residents. And despite taxpayers ponying up, hundreds of school districts and other local governments have accumulated billions of dollars in debt.Something's got to give. Illinois lost more residents last year than any state in the country. Property taxes are a primary reason for the exodus.The property tax system in Illinois, and particularly in Cook County, needs an overhaul. Voters are likely in November to sweep in a new county assessor, Frederick \"Fritz\" Kaegi, who has promised to address the regressive nature of the county's assessment process. But government spending, which drives property tax levies, is outside his control.Statewide, House Republican Leader Jim Durkin, R-Western Springs, introduced legislation in June that would sunset the state's property tax code on July 1, 2019. If his legislation gets signed into law, the next governor and legislature would have about six months to come up with a replacement system. Helping local governments deal with pension costs would have to be part of the solution.Good. Springfield needs deadlines. Yet only a handful of Republicans signed on as co-sponsors and no Democrats. Hello? Is anybody there?Property taxes should not be a partisan issue. All public officials should be working toward a solution. Indiana legislators put a question on the November 2010 ballot to amend the state Constitution. Homeowners are now charged 1 percent of their primary home's market value unless they approve a referendum to raise taxes higher. The caps keep government spending in check.Historically, the legislature has done little to address local property tax pressure. Lawmakers failed to tackle the complex issues that drive local spending -- including pension costs and unfunded mandates -- while sending less money to school districts. School boards then relied on property taxes to fund education. Talk about regressive.This year, Harvey became the first municipality to have state revenue owed it garnished because the city wasn't making payments to its retiree funds as required. More villages and cities are expected to follow; a recent report from Wirepoints.com found more than 200 municipalities failed to make proper payments into their police and fire pension funds.State Rep. Mark Batinick, R-Plainfield, has suggested local governments consolidate pension funds to reduce administrative costs. That idea deserves a harder look.With a new school funding formula approved last year that directs more state money to school districts, local property taxpayers should get some relief. That is, if their districts recognize the duty to ensure new money doesn't provoke a spending spree. We'll see.Meanwhile, local governments need to streamline, consolidate and shrink. Example: McHenry County officials are considering a proposal to reduce the size of the county board from 24 members to 18. That's in addition to an 11.2 percent cut in the tax levy approved last year. Chairman Jack Franks also is pushing school districts to reduce their levies. This is leadership that officials in other counties should be copy-catting.In his mayoral campaign, Wilson has tapped into frustration over property taxes that is gaining traction. People are fed up. Handing out checks from his charity is a generous gesture. But it doesn't solve the underlying problem of governments over-promising, overspending and over-borrowing. Nor does it fix the property tax system.Elected officials -- state and local, Democrats and Republicans -- need to prioritize property tax reform as they march toward state and city elections. Taxpayers should hold them accountable. What is their plan? Without a good one, the Illinois exodus continues.Join the discussion on Twitter @Trib_Ed_Board and on Facebook.Submit a letter to the editor here or email letters@chicagotribune.com.___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "764"}

{"content": "d ( Scott Feldstein | Flickr )Many dementia patients struggle to sleep but findings of a new study have warned that giving sleeping pills to these patients may raise their risk of broken bones.Sleeping Pills And Increased Risk Of FracturesIn a study presented at the Alzheimer's Association annual meeting, in Chicago on Tuesday, Chris Fox, from the University of East Anglia in Great Britain, and colleagues looked at the effects of the commonly prescribed sleep drug zolpidem, zopiclone and zaleplon, or the so-called- Z-drugs on dementia patients.Z-drugs are often prescribed for people suffering from insomnia but they are thought to cause increased confusion and other problems such as fractures, resulting from falls. Researchers said that people with dementia are particularly vulnerable and it is not clear if the drugs are especially harmful for them.The researchers studied the data of dementia patients who took the drugs under the brand names Lunesta, Ambien and Sonata, and those who did not take the drugs.Analysis revealed that those who took the sleeping pills had a 40 percent increased risk of any type of fracture. The risk also increased with higher doses of the drugs. Fox and colleagues also found that the sleep drugs were also linked to increased risk of hip fractures.Fractures, especially hip fractures, are known to increase risk of premature death.Alternative Treatments For Dementia Patients With Sleep ProblemsFox and colleagues discouraged the use of Z-drugs for dementia patients and called for alternative treatments.\"Fractures in people with dementia can have a devastating impact, including loss of mobility, increased dependency, and death. We desperately need better alternatives to the drugs currently being prescribed for sleep problems and other non-cognitive symptoms of dementia,\" Fox said.Fox said that people with dementia should avoid taking Z-drugs if the sleep disturbance can be managed in other ways. For patients prescribed with Z-drugs, they should receive care that can reduce or prevent the occurrence of falls.The Alzheimer's Association cited non-drug treatments that can help promote rest in people with Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia.These including avoidance of alcohol, caffeine and nicotine; regular daily exercise, having regular times for meals and sleeping, morning light exposure, using the bed only for sleeping, and not watching televisions during periods of wakefulness.\"Non-drug coping strategies should always be tried before medications, since some sleep medications can cause serious side effects,\" the health organization said.", "id": "766"}
{"content": "July 30--Each week Nina Metz and Darcel Rockett recap and discuss the second season of \"Claws,\" which airs Sundays on TNT.Note: Spoilers aheadIn \"Crossroards,\" Desna sits in a jail cell realizing she \"stayed on the ride too long,\" while Jen and Bryce have their own unwelcome complication to deal with in the form of Hank, the deranged rabbi. And then there's Ann and Polly, who both make the wise decision to kick their significant others to the curb.1. The rabbi goes rogueNina Metz: \"Claws\" has now devised two ways to help Bryce find his way back to his marriage: first a near-death gunshot wound and now a deranged Hank attempting to kidnap Jen and the kids to Israel. Look, I'm a believer in these two -- that wasn't always the case, but something about this goofy Jen-Bryce dynamic works and they're the most stable couple on the show at the moment, which is kind of hilarious. Bryce's morphine-induced TED talk hallucination was yet again another sharp pop cultural parody; I can't think of another series at the moment that keeps returning to this type of in-narrative spoofery on such a consistent basis. It's such an inspired idea to come out of Season 2.Darcel Rockett: Rabbi Hank finally snaps and goes full stalker this week, making himself at home in Jen's house cooking and putting pictures of his face pasted over Bryce's around the house -- creepy, much? When Bryce wakes up to see Hank over him with a needle, all I could think was: He's going to kill Bryce after all he's been through? But then he doesn't. No smothering and no air bubble in his I.V. (come on people, these are classic soap opera signatures). Granted, if Bryce had died, he would never have been able to rescue Jen. And their babies do need their parents, especially now that they're both sober and have plans to be normal. Let's hope the rabbi and Mandy get together after their stint in jail -- he's in need of a love interest and Mandy needs someone to love her. It's like cellmatch.com. But I digress, what do you think, Nina?NM: I'm intrigued with all the ways \"Claws\" is playing around with traditional soap opera tropes. The idea of salting every installment with melodrama for the sake of melodrama (as soaps often do) can feel like a cheat in terms of storytelling. But what's interesting here is that the writers on \"Claws\" have found a way to embrace these tropes as a way to up the stakes while also subverting them through a winking, candy-colored, parody-loving filter. There's something genius about it.2. Zlata and Des are die or ride (close enough)DR: To quote the Kool-Aid Man on this plot line: Oh yeah! About dang time. Zlata comes to the aid of Desna after she's charged with racketeering and money laundering. And then she reveals what Desna already knew -- the betrayal that she and Dr. G have been putting down on her. Say what you will about the Russians, Zlata knows that the tides are turning and she has to hustle to make sure she stays on top.Dr. G's mama knows this too and is the bug in her son's ear on it. (Was anyone else freaked out by the fact that the two were drinking champagne in the pool together? Note to \"Claws\" writers: Do not leave us hanging until next season to resolve the Oedipus complexities of this relationship!) So now the race is on: Desna has started the war she wanted and if all works out, the two evils will take each other out and leave Des and the Palmghetto girls still standing. Now, we just have to get rid of the Ditzy Mafia (I mean Dixie Mafia) and get the Feds off their scent. Hmmm? I wonder if Roller would do a stint in prison for Desna? If she gets a record, all bets are off for her money-making schemes.NM: Let's talk about how Desna went about explaining the fallout after her arrest because as we say in the news business, she buried the lead. She should have led with: \"Ann, your girlfriend is still a cop and she's the one who arrested me.\"But Desna's slowly getting savvier. Arriving at the Hammer &amp; Pickle in that space-age olive-colored catsuit (you can read about Desna's jumpsuits in my interview with the show's costume designer Dolores Ybarra here) she was finally in the right state of mind. Negotiating with Zlata the terms of their collaboration, she was all poker face. We have to assume Zlata isn't taking Desna at her word though, right? Zlata (and her hairstyle) may be severe, but she's nobody's fool.The show also brought back Mandy. Who among us honestly remembered this character? Anyone? Oh right, she was Desna's realtor back in Season 1 who, we learn, now subsists on a diet of cocaine and La Croix due to the \"constant pressure to make the commissions. To be that girl with that hair and that body and those coral palazzo pants.\" Desna's no-nonsense reply: \"Go to therapy. Work out. Eat chocolate\" -- anything but this. Even in the clink, Desna's maternal instincts are still intact. Her brief interlude with Mandy was indeed random but it was also a pretty decent snapshot of a woman falling apart, Florida smile still plastered on her face.Something else to consider: It's only now, in jail, that Desna becomes introspective about (gestures vaguely at everything) and finally questions her decisions. Desna might benefit from a little therapy herself, no?3. Dean makes like Billy Joel: He's moving outNM: The emotional turmoil -- the instability -- that Dean's been feeling is real. He's handled it pretty well, all things considered. But I give him credit for deciding to make a break; that can't be easy, not when he's lived with Desna his entire life. It's his bond with Virginia that likely made the choice possible. I take back what I said earlier -- it's Dean and Virginia who are the most stable couple on this show. It's not often that we see a romantic relationship between a person on the spectrum and a person who is neurotypical and I like that \"Claws\" doesn't overthink it or infantilize Dean, even if this is probably his first serious relationship.Dean was Virginia's rock when she had the abortion earlier this season and she's returning the favor now that he can't rely on Desna.DR: Dean has been on a roller coaster this season -- from Baby Daddy, to exotic dancer, to new home, to new fianc\u00e9e ... and then Des gets arrested. For every other thing, he has risen to the occasion. But the separation of their family unit is his undoing and I can't blame him for that. Providing a stable environment is key to his daily living and Des provides anything but. It's heartbreaking to see him take his Hammer &amp; Pickle money to the police station to get her released only to be turned away very rudely by the officer on duty (who has no idea that Dean is on the spectrum -- all vocations/professions that deal with the public should have tons of training on this. Things could have escalated and turned out badly for Dean because people in uniforms are impatient).Come correct ladies and Dean will forgive.4. Polly's family bubble popsDR: Marnie's mom returns and Dr. Ken confesses to Polly about his wire-tapping ways. The former forces Marnie to make a choice that we all hope she makes in favor of Polly. But on the flipside, Marnie can't be Polly's end-all and be-all. She's a teen girl. Let her be young. Don't put her in the role of your missing sister, Polly. But alas, that's the road we're going down now that Dr. Ken is revealed as the snitch to the Feds. His role was more reprehensible than that of a terrorist and a pedophile. That's low. So now Polly is Ken-less and Desna is Dean-less and yep, Quiet Ann is Arlene-less. There is a saying: I can do bad all by myself. And unfortunately the ladies will have to walk the walk on this one. But when the chips are down, your girls rally and I have a feeling when these women stop the tears, they will lay waste to the landscape full of betrayers and backstabbers and it will be glorious!NM: Something I think worth noting about \"Claws\" is how deeply loyal the women are toward one another, even when they they're at odds. I found it notable that Polly didn't tear into Ken because he's a wimp (he is) or because he couldn't put enough brain cells together to let everyone know about Arlene (ugh, Ken!). I mean, yes, she's exasperated about all of that. But the final straw is this: \"You don't know the first thing about loyalty.\" She's right. There's a good bit of emphasis on loyalty on this show. Even Clay Husser talks a big loyalty game (without actually practicing it, mind you). But ultimately it's the esteemed nail artisans of Palmetto County who understand what the concept really means.Polly knows loyalty, but establishing appropriate parental boundaries, not so much. Crying on Marnie's shoulder is just bad judgment, even if Polly does make her a plate of snicky-snacks once she pulls herself together again.One more thing I want to mention about Polly: The barely here breadcrumbs about her estranged twin sister we got a few episodes back are are a good example of the show's minor flaws this season. What should have been a major narrative thread for this character -- and let's note, yet another soap opera trope; a long lost twin sister! -- has been treated as an after-thought. I'm not saying we need every bit of info laid out all at once, but there's not even a slow built here; the show introduced this tidbit weeks ago and then all but abandoned it.5. Arlene is \"Sorry, not sorry\"NM: Why do we think \"Claws\" showed us this confrontation? I'm trying to figure that out, because we learn nothing new from it. A colder person than Ann might have ghosted Arlene the moment she found out the truth -- but maybe she had to see it on Arlene's face to finally realize her (oh so sweet, oh so hilarious) dream of building a cabin together in Vermont was all for naught.Here's the problem with Arlene as a character: She's completely undeveloped. We know nothing about her aside from her profession and her willingness to use Ann as an unwitting informant. So the emotional stakes exist only for Ann, which seems like a missed opportunity. Also: What was with that look on Desna's face in the van -- that \"I'm plotting something\" look -- when Ann went in to confront her lady love?By the way, non-lawyer here but this keeps bugging me: It's one thing to bring Desna in for questioning based on something the police heard on a wiretap. My \"Law &amp; Order\" legal degree tells me this is one way cops get judges to sign off on search warrants, and that's probably what led to the FBI raid on the salon. But don't prosecutors need actual evidence of said laundering and racketeering to even charge her?DR: I could just scratch Arlene's eyes out. She doesn't have any qualms throwing Ann and her friends under the bus to save her job. And when Ann confronts her and asks her if any of it was real, Arlene's response is: Does it matter? Does it matter?! Ann was a true soldier when she walked out, because I would have at least slapped her until she saw stars. No remorse, none at all. Even the Hussers show they have feelings, despite all their sinning. She's just become another hurdle for the women to jump over for freedom. So don't look back Ann, just leave her in the dust.Look, I'm ready for Arlene to go bye-bye, but I'm ready for Hank to say so-long, too. Will I get what I want? I thought I might -- and then the writers brought Mandy back (why, hello, left field) ... so now I'm a little skeptical that the writers will kill off the outliers faster than later.nmetz@chicagotribune.comdrockett@chicagotribune.com@Nina_Metz@DarcelTribune___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "767"}
{"content": "Work is a place where many of us take risks. We take our jobs seriously, and when we have setbacks, they hurt. Maybe you\u2019ve lost an important account, or maybe you\u2019ve received a less-than-stellar performance evaluation. Everyone learns to deal with disappointment at work in different ways. Some of these techniques are more productive than others.Ideally, you can use your negative experiences to strengthen you for the future. Disappointment hurts, but it doesn\u2019t have to hurt forever. Use these five proven techniques to process your feelings and help you become a stronger, more resilient person.     5 Ways to Cope with Disappointment at Work1. Take Time to Honor your FeelingsIt\u2019s better to take the time to feel your negative emotions rather than bottling everything up. Psychotherapist Tina Gilbertson encourages people to \u201cwallow\u201d a little before moving on. \u201cAlso, find a word for how you feel, such as disappointed, resentful, or afraid. Labeling feelings helps us make sense of our experience.\u201dExploring your sad feelings and your disappointment may help you learn to deal with it next time. Is there anything you could have done to avoid your disappointment? If not, you can put it away more easily. If there are ways you could have improved, focus on making these changes for your own sake.     2. Don\u2019t Take it PersonallyWhen something goes wrong at work and you receive a reprimand, try not to take it as an attack on you personally. Finding out that your work was not up to standards hurts, but it is about your objective performance, not about you as a human being.It\u2019s very difficult to divorce yourself from self-hatred when you make a mistake. Don\u2019t let yourself fall into this trap. You are a worthy person no matter what your work statistics say. Remind yourself about your good qualities both in the office and at home in your personal life. Making one mistake, even if it may feel like the end of the world at the time, will often have little to no effect on your life as you move forward. Try to let go of your feelings of resentment and depression, as these will only hold you back. Learning to deal with disappointment properly will make you feel better and ready to move on in your work life.3. Have a Good VentWithin reason, vent to a friend or loved one. A colleague may not be the best person to vent to about your disappointment, as he or she might be invested in the outcome of your problem. Let out all of your negative feelings. Make sure your friend is ready to hear a long vent and can be there to support you rather than judging you for your loss of composure. After a long vent and maybe a little cry, you will feel more ready to move on and deal with disappointment.     When you vent, try not to make personal judgments about the people who were responsible for your disappointment. This will only create bitter feelings in your heart and cause more resentment down the road. After you finish your venting, you should feel lighter and calmer, not more worked up.4. Re-Evaluate Your ExpectationsIf you continually find yourself being disappointed at work, it\u2019s worthwhile to check your expectations and to make sure that they line up with the reality of working in your office. It could be that the job is not the right fit for you, especially if you are never recognized for your hard work. Adjust your expectations and perhaps you\u2019ll find you are not disappointed by as many situations in the office.5. Try AgainDon\u2019t let your career be derailed by a setback. Jump back on the horse and try again. Your persistence in the face of obstacles will pay off. Employers notice when someone who has been let down continues to work just as hard as before. This persistence and strength may be rewarded down the road.Learning to persist despite disappointments is an important life lesson. When you have internalized this, you\u2019ll be able to move forward with your career.Final ThoughtsDealing with life\u2019s setbacks can be upsetting, but it makes us stronger. When you are experiencing difficulties at work, remember these five steps. Honor your feelings and take time to vent to a close friend or family member. Don\u2019t take your disappointments personally, as they do not reflect on you as a person. Check your expectations and make sure they are realistic. Finally, try again.These five steps will help you move forward with new intention in your career. While everyone experiences setbacks and disappointments at work, they don\u2019t have to take over your life.", "id": "768"}
{"content": "Though currently a member of the Toronto Raptors, future free agent forward Kawhi Leonard is still expected to join the Clippers or Lakers next summer.Kawhi Leonard has found his new home \u2014 for now. The former San Antonio Spurs forward was traded to Toronto in July, in exchange for Raptors guard DeMar DeRozan. It was a solid trade for both parties involved, but it doesn\u2019t seem too early for the Raptors to begin worrying about Leonard\u2019s future with the team.After all, he made it clear he wanted to be in Los Angeles. It\u2019s very possible Leonard opts-out after this season and becomes a free agent, able to choose his next destination.According to Sporting News\u2019 Sean Deveney, Leonard\u2019s mindset hasn\u2019t changed. He still wants to come to Los Angeles next summer, to either the Clippers or the Lakers.\u201cMost around the league still expect that Leonard will look to return home to Southern California, either to join LeBron James with the Lakers or bring his star power to the Clippers.\u201dWhile this isn\u2019t exactly news to those keeping up with the Clippers and their future endeavors, it is certainly a good sign. The free agency pool next summer is going to be one of the most loaded in recent memory, potentially featuring the likes of Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, Jimmy Butler, and Klay Thompson.Per the LA Times\u2019 Brad Turner, LA could have as much as $70 million free next summer. That\u2019s enough for two max players, and more money than virtually any other team could offer.Not only could the Clippers land Leonard, then, but they could also pair him with an elite guard in Irving or Butler.However, all of this is of course speculation. There are those who believe that Leonard may re-sign in Toronto, assuming all things go well this season, which is fairly likely. Without LeBron James in the East, the Raptors will have a much easier path to success. The Celtics, 76ers, and Pacers may prove difficult, but after all, it has been James\u2019 Cavaliers that have eliminated the Raptors in back-to-back-to-back seasons.How aggressive the Clippers will be in their pursuit of Leonard is unknown, but based on how this summer went, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see an all-out effort by the front office.", "id": "769"}
{"content": "July 28--The troubles with Chicago policing date back at least to the days of Al Capone, who had a multitude of cops on the take. Ancient history? Sure, the fedora's gone out of style, but never incidents of corruption and misuse of force within the Chicago Police Department. Since 1960, as we recently noted, City Hall tried six times through a task force or commission to reform the CPD so it would deliver what the citizens of Chicago deserve: a police force they trust to serve and protect. Each attempt fell short. Since 2004, City Hall has paid more than $700 million to settle police misconduct lawsuits.On Friday, though, Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan unveiled a draft version of a consent decree -- the framework for federal oversight of a reform process of CPD. Why should a cynical city think this would make a difference? Because of that phrase \"federal oversight.\" The decree would set standards, and the city wouldn't be freed from the decree until a federal judge is convinced it has met the standards. Think of the so-called Shakman decree that has sought to reduce political favoritism in governance here.But a consent decree relies on the agreement of several parties, something the issuance of a draft doesn't signify. So while this is a historic moment for policing in Chicago, there's not yet a deal to celebrate. Don't be surprised if the Fraternal Order of Police tries to torpedo any agreement. And Emanuel has been walking a tightrope, seeking to support police fighting crime while also fighting police misconduct.Now's the time for the public to absorb this lengthy document and weigh in. So can the FOP, which mounted a late-inning attempt to intervene in the negotiations. We'll go first, to the limited extent we can at this early stage: Getting from draft to signed and court-monitored decree will be a heavy lift, but it's necessary if Chicago is to break long cycles of misconduct by elements within CPD. We're grateful to the people who've brought the effort this far -- Emanuel and those who forced him to the table, including Madigan, the American Civil Liberties Union and community voices demanding reform.The 232-page document lays out the expectations for a police force that would function efficiently and honorably for all residents, in all neighborhoods. Remember, the impetus for the consent decree was the death of African-American teen Laquan McDonald, shot 16 times by a white officer. It took 14 months for the public to see a video of the incident. Many citizens say it depicts police officers operating inappropriately. A subsequent U.S. Department of Justice investigation faulted the Police Department for poor training, lax oversight and a culture that often tolerated misconduct.The consent decree draft won praise Friday from several outside experts involved in the negotiations. They said it sets the right agenda to fix policies, training, supervision and accountability. Great, but nice words, we imagine, were also said about previous efforts. This is the seventh try. The difference-maker this time would be the involvement of a federal judge who, along with a monitor, would ride herd on the city.In other words, the problem with CPD won't be fixed because Emanuel says it's fixed or Madigan says it's fixed or the FOP says it never was broken. The Chicago custom of addressing a problem by passing a couple of ordinances, and issuing a flurry of news releases, won't solve Chicago policing.With a consent decree, the problem would be fixed when the judge is satisfied -- maybe 10 or more years from now.Join the discussion on Twitter @Trib_Ed_Board and on Facebook.Submit a letter to the editor here or email letters@chicagotribune.com.___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "770"}
{"content": "Fox is rumored to be developing a prequel series to \"24,\" with the original creators involved. It will be an ongoing series instead of a limited one and is poised to explore the Jack Bauer origin story. ( Fox | Facebook )Jack Bauer might be gracing TV screens again, according to reports. A prequel series is reportedly in development for the hit espionage thriller, which won a number of Emmy trophies while it was still on air.Citing sources, The Hollywood Reporter claims that there will be an ongoing prequel series that will delve into the origin story of how Jack Bauer became who he is.Fox Might Be Making A Prequel Series To '24'Original series creators Joel Surnow and Bob Cochran are said to be sharing ideas for the character originally played by Kiefer Sutherland, according to the report. Executive producer Howard Gordon is allegedly attached to the project and is working with Surnow and Cochran on the notional show as well.The creators are co-writing a script for what sources say could be an ongoing series instead of a limited affair, unlike most recent incarnations in the franchise, 24: Live Another Day and 24: Legacy. It remains uncertain when the prequel series airs, though there are rumors suggesting Fox could premiere it for midseason. Just note that casting apparently hasn't even begun yet, so the project seems to be still in its early stages.The most recent 24 installment was the aforementioned 24: Legacy, which aired after last year's Super Bowl. Initial ratings were stellar but dipped down leading up to the finale, bowing with just 6.3 million viewers. Fox promptly canceled the series following less-than-stellar numbers but said at the time that it was talking to producers, including Gordon and Brian Grazer, about a new \"anthological\" take on the whole franchise.Two months later, producers and executives said the network and the studio were in early discussion about an idea that was \"very compelling.\" The goal was apparently to keep the \"ticking clock\" aspect that made the original show a hit with viewers and apply it to something else.24 is one of Fox's most prized franchises, having run for eight seasons and sparking political discourse along the way. It was later being revived with original star Sutherland for the aforementioned 24: Live Another Day. 24: Legacy followed shortly thereafter, but it focused on a different character and told a different story entirely. Sutherland didn't appear in that project but served as an executive producer.Would you like a prequel series to 24? Do you think Jack Bauer's origin story should be explored, or is mystery one of his biggest appeals as a character?

{"content": "(Photo by Al Bello/Getty Images)Training camp is now in full swing for the Washington Redskins. Here\u2019s a look at the roster bubble as it stands and which players are in or out.The battle for the 53-man roster unofficially began on July 26 when the Washington Redskins reported to camp. With 90 men currently on the unit, 37 will have to be cut before Week 1 of the NFL season. Almost all of these will occur on cut day, but it\u2019s never to early to start assessing who might be on the roster bubble.Roster bubbles are notoriously difficult to figure out. Last season, nobody had Stefan McClure near the roster bubble, and he actually made the 53-man squad. But generally speaking, there are players whose roster spots are locked in, players who stand virtually no shot of making the team, and then, there are the 20 or so guys that are truly on the bubble.This year, the Redskins are flush with talent (at least for the moment) so they are going to be faced with some tough decisions. In our first installment of bubble rankings, we\u2019ll take a look at who the last five players that make the roster will be, and who the first five out will be.Obviously, these are not set in stone. We\u2019ll continue to update and debate about the roster bubble for the month and a half to come. So, sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride.", "id": "772"}
{"content": "Aug. 02--SANTA CLARA -- Garnett is slated to miss his fourth straight practice Thursday because of a knee injury. Jonathan Cooper, perhaps Garnett's top challenger for the starting right guard spot, is not expected to join team drills until next week because of his own knee issue.\"I'd like those two to get out there,\" Shanahan said of Garnett and Cooper. \"It's tough to make this team and do it if you're not out there.\"Garnett sustained his injury Saturday, apparently from banging into into another player's knee. He's worn a compression sleeve on his left leg while watching practices since then.After Wednesday's session, Shanahan said: \"I was a little surprised Garnett didn't make it today. I'd be more surprised if he's not out there tomorrow.\"Garnett, a 2016 first-round draft pick out of Stanford, did not play last season after injuring his right knee a week into camp and taking the year to get in better shape.Also not practicing because of another bout with injuries are Arik Armstead and Jimmie Ward, two other former first-round draft pick from the previous regime under general manager Trent Baalke. Both have hamstring issues, and Armstead's is listed as \"week to week\" while Ward's is more precautionary.Garnett and Mike Person have rotated first-team reps since the offseason program, and Cooper could be the favorite for the spot once he is cleared to join team drills, likely come Sunday. Cooper came off the physically unable to perform list Tuesday and is position drills the past two days.Cooper started 13 games at left guard last season for the Cowboys, so perhaps the 49ers put him there and shift Laken Tomlinson, who was a right guard in college at Duke and with the Detroit Lions prior to joining the 49ers. Tomlinson started the final 15 games last year at left guard.The right guard job opened up when Brandon Fusco left in free agency for the Atlanta Falcons. Fusco was a surprise starter last season after arriving as unheralded free agent, much like Person this year.___(c)2018 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)Visit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "773"}
{"content": "For many people, being cheated on can be devastating due to the trust that is broken in the relationship. Infidelity can shatter the bond that was shared and often ends the relationship or marriage. You may feel disrespected and no longer trust or respect your partner.In many cases, underlying issues in the relationship are often the cause of infidelity and why the partner begins looking elsewhere for love and validation. Although the pain that you experience can be challenging, it can allow you to take on a new perspective. Infidelity is never validated or healthy, but can impact you in positive ways.     Here\u2019s why being cheated on can be a good thing:Learn How to Love YourselfIn many cases, it can be easy to love someone else more than you love yourself. Staying in a relationship too long can make it difficult to have respect for yourself or feel like you\u2019re deserving of something better. By separating from the individual, you\u2019ll have time to understand what you want in life and spend time doing some self-reflection, which can allow you to understand your value.Become More IndependentAlthough infidelity can be painful to experience, it can allow you to become more of an independent person. If the person you love broke your trust, it can allow you to change your perspective of who they are and avoid having co-dependency. You\u2019ll learn to become more independent and take care of yourself instead of relying on another individual to fill your needs or help you to be happy in life.     Independence is necessary to ensure that you don\u2019t look towards a person or a relationship to allow you to feel fulfilled. You can grow and mature due to their infidelity, which can allow you to develop positively despite the circumstances.If you become more independent after you\u2019re cheated on, you\u2019re likely to choose a better mate in the future and set your standards higher on the person that you\u2019re in a relationship with long-term. Becoming more self-conscious and self-aware, you\u2019ll feel more empowered and strengthened rather than become a victim of infidelity. The higher mating intelligence can prevent you from failing to have a successful and lasting relationship in the future.Communicate Better for a Healthier RelationshipIn many cases, a lack of communication in relationships can cause your partner to cheat. Once you learn of the infidelity, it can motivate you to work on ways to improve the relationship and how to restore the bond that you shared. The only way to rebuild the relationship after you\u2019ve been cheated on is to learn how to communicate in a healthy way that allows you to feel close again if you decide to stay together. You may need to set aside a night each week where you go on a date or learn how to become more honest with your feelings and emotions.     Learn How to ForgiveAlthough forgiveness is rarely easy, it\u2019s essential to ensure that you don\u2019t become a victim once you\u2019re cheated on in your relationship. You\u2019ll learn how to release the blame on the person to ensure that you can both move on and avoid overthinking and reliving the past. In some cases, you may need to learn how to forgive with the help of a professional counselor or therapist that you provide you with tips and techniques of letting go of the pain. Forgivingwill allow you to remain a healthier person who isn\u2019t bitter to ensure that you can strengthen your relationship with your partner or move on to a healthier one.In many cases, learning how to forgive can even save your relationship if you want it to survive. You can both learn from the experience and work on developing a healthier marriage to ensure that you both are happy staying together and can work on having a better future together as a couple.Personal GrowthPersonal growth is often a byproduct of being cheated on due to the self-reflection that it requires. You may begin to ask yourself how you could have been a better partner and if there are any areas that you need to improve in as a girlfriend, boyfriend, or spouse.You\u2019ll also mature from the experience and understand that you can\u2019t control the actions of another person in your relationship. You may also learn how to identify deceitful behavior or lying with other people due to your experience.Although no one ever wants to be cheated on by their partner, the event can offer many benefits that you don\u2019t expect once you begin to work through the betrayal and grief. With a bit of self-reflection and forgiveness, you can grow more as an individual and learn from the experience rather than allowing it to make a negative impact on your life.", "id": "774"}

{"content": "July 25--Fans of the Fighting Irish have to wait a few more weeks to watch their team in opening game battle against Michigan.Meantime, always and forever -- and even if you're not a Notre Dame fan -- there's \"Rudy.\" On Aug. 6, the warmly regarded 1993 underdog favorite, starring Sean Astin as the improbable Notre Dame football legend Daniel \"Rudy\" Ruettiger, celebrates its 25th anniversary with a Music Box Theatre screening. The Tribune-sponsored presentation will be introduced by Ruettiger himself, in conversation with Tribune film critic Michael Phillips (that's me) and Tribune sports columnist Phil Rosenthal.Highlights from the Music Box event will be used in a video accompanying the movie's return to nearly 700 theaters Aug. 28 and Sept. 2 across all 50 states. Sony Pictures Entertainment and Fathom Events are handling the national re-release.All sports biopics bank on the triumph of the human spirit, selling variations on the value of dogged persistence to the end. \"Rudy's\" story is more dogged than most. It's about an ordinary figure, one of 14 kids raised in a working-class Joliet family, who played all of three plays and 27 seconds in a single 1975 Notre Dame game utterly lacking in conventional suspense.The movie, written by Angelo Pizzo and directed by David Anspaugh, came to fruition seven years after the same team found success with \"Hoosiers\" (1986), another fact-based Cinderella story.\"It took 10 years,\" Ruettiger says of the movie's development, \"but I did it.\" We spoke by phone Tuesday evening; the 69-year-old Nevada transplant, who makes his living as an author and a motivational speaker, had just landed in Indianapolis for a gig with the Associated General Contractors of America Safety &amp; Health Conference.\"Notre Dame was totally against the idea at first,\" he says of the film. \"The athletics department didn't want to see a movie about a guy like me, not the usual best-of-the-best type guy. But gradually they understood, and approved it.\" \"Rudy\" became the second football biopic to be filmed at Notre Dame; \"Knute Rockne -- All American\" (1940) was the first.While attending Joliet Catholic Academy in high school, Ruettiger played guard and linebacker. The teenager coped with undiagnosed dyslexia until he found the right mentors and educators at Holy Cross College, across the road from Notre Dame. Ruettiger improved his grades and kept his eye on his prized goal. He was accepted into Notre Dame on his fourth try.In his final year there, after serving as a glorified tackling dummy in scrimmage after scrimmage, he dressed for a single game and managed to sack the Georgia Tech quarterback in the final seconds. For his valiant efforts he was carried off the field on his teammates' shoulders. As Johanna Steinmetz wrote in the 1993 Tribune review: \"Carefully building climax upon climax, the story spirals to an underdog triumph every bit as tearful as that of 'Rocky.' \"The movie co-stars Ned Beatty, Lili Taylor, Jon Favreau, Robert Prosky and, in a bit part, Vince Vaughn. These days, Ruettiger says, \"good movies with a good message are hard to find. They're hard to market. That's what they told me when I went to Hollywood back in 1982. But 'Rocky,' 'Field of Dreams,' 'Hoosiers' -- they're all about dreams, you know? It's the idea that if you stick to it, something good can happen.\"\"I tell ya, buddy,\" Ruettiger tells me, \"every week I hear it from cab drivers, executives, all kinds of people: When they were growing up, they used this movie to keep going. It's really something.\"Click here for tickets ($20) to the Aug. 6 \"Rudy\" event at the Music Box Theatre, 3733 N.

{"content": "July 26--Roquan Smith isn't the only inside linebacker whose orientation to Bears training camp has been delayed. Veteran Danny Trevathan missed his sixth consecutive practice Thursday morning, still hampered by a hamstring issue that has kept him off the field since the team's arrival at Olivet Nazarene University last week.It's unknown when Trevathan's injury occurred. But his inability to practice for the first full week of camp is a legitimate concern given that the inside linebacker has missed 24 games because of injuries over his last four seasons with the Bears and Broncos.After Thursday's practice, Bears coach Matt Nagy expressed optimism in Trevathan's recovery.\"Day by day he's getting closer,\" Nagy said. \"We feel really good about it. He's in good spirits. And eventually, when we feel the time is right, he'll be back out there leading this defense.\"The Bears expect Trevathan to be an impact playmaker and a vocal leader of the defense in 2018. It's far from ideal that he hasn't been able to hit the ground running in camp. Still, the Bears have six-plus weeks until Week 1 of the regular season arrives and are taking the cautious route in bringing Trevathan back.As for Smith, the Bears' top draft pick has still not reported to training camp and, as of Thursday afternoon, was one of only two first-round picks leaguewide yet to sign. (The other is Jets quarterback Sam Darnold.)Smith's agents and the Bears' front office are still in a staring contest over fine-print financial details in the rookie's contract. The holdup is not believed to be over offset language in the contract, which has been a sticking point in the deals of some first-round picks in recent years.Nagy was asked Thursday if he sensed the Bears were getting any closer to finalizing a deal with Smith.\"I think we may be,\" he said. \"I feel good about the whole thing.\"At this point, it is highly unlikely that Smith will be in camp in time to to play in next week's Hall of Fame Game against the Ravens in Canton, Ohio. The Bears will also likely hold him out of the preseason finale on Aug. 30 against the Bills. That would leave him with three other openings to gain experience through preseason game action -- Aug. 9 at Cincinnati; Aug. 18 at Denver; and Aug. 25 at Soldier Field against the Chiefs.As for Smith's teammates? They're eager to get the rookie on the field but also understanding of the business dynamics that have complicated his arrival.\"The kid's a great kid,\" defensive end Akiem Hicks said Thursday. \"He's a remarkable athlete and a remarkable talent.

{"content": "July 26--\"This album was about letting go of what people say is cool-sounding, what people think is cool-sounding, even what I think is cool-sounding,\" said actress and singer Brittany Campbell.On \"Stay Gold,\" her third album, Campbell made a conscious decision to abandon some of the conventions that define contemporary R&amp;B (think minimalist electronic production and soft, whispery vocals) to return the genre to its rightful origins.\"There was something about making electronic sounds that wasn't really doing it for me,\" Campbell said. \"I really wanted some live elements in there. It was just so important to me with this one.\" Campbell added her live band to the studio recordings, giving \"Stay Gold\" a richer vibe of its own.The record was made with intention. It is an album of deliberate, delicate decisions. Album opener \"Mean\" may begin with synthetic keys and Campbell's slow, warm, honeyed vocals, but it soon builds into a lush, multilayered wonder. For the average listener, it may be difficult to decipher the electronic accompaniments from the live ones, a balance Campbell said she spent a good amount of time trying to figure out. \"Figuring out how to mesh the analog sound with the digital was also sort of tricky. It was something I had to take my time with to still maintain the coolness of the music,\" she said.As a beat-maker and producer in her own right, Campbell needed to leave behind her natural instincts to \"make beats all the time,\" quickly craft her album on her computer and release it on Soundcloud. \"This time, I wanted to be deliberate with every aspect: production-wise, songwriting-wise,\" Campbell acknowledged. \"It was a lot of trial and error, with just me alone editing it all together and me picking and choosing what works and what doesn't.\"But before the editing process even began, Campbell said, the album had been a work in progress dating back nearly two years. Like many artists, Campbell said the 2016 presidential election affected how she made art and the type of art she wanted to make in the future.\"I remember that day. I remember my friends that day, and I remember the aftermath of people being so angry on social media and just in the world,\" Campbell said. \"It made me think about people and about humans. Our ability to disassociate with one another so easily and disconnect. My feeling, even in the face of the election, is that I've never been a human being to disconnect from others.\"For Campbell, \"Stay Gold\" was an opportunity to communicate with others on a more intrinsic level. \"I'm a dreamer and sort of utopian in a way and I didn't want the record to feel like a statement. I wanted it to be something people could connect to,\" she said.To help her in the creation process, she spent a lot of time listening to albums she knew could help her shape what she wanted to accomplish with her album. One record in particular -- Marvin Gaye's \"What's Going On\" -- was especially poignant. \"That album is the pinnacle of all albums to me. It finally gave me the motivation and bravery to even put my assurance on myself,\" Campbell said.The result of Campbell's studying and slow craftsmanship is an accessible record sure to appeal to even the most finicky of listeners. \"I wanted it to be an honest, honest album,\" Campbell said. \"I wanted to make sure all of the messages were clear.\"We are all listening.Britt Julious is a freelance writer.onthetown@chicagotribune.comWhen: 7 p.m. Aug. 3Where: Hi Chicago Hostel, 24 E.

{"content": "DANBURY \u2014 Police officers made almost 400 complaints against the city\u2019s own 911 dispatch center in the first 18 months after it was outsourced to a private company in early 2015, new court records show.  The complaints illustrate a pattern of behavior that is \u201clikely beyond a mere accident\u201d and could have contributed to problems in the dispatch center\u2019s response to the assault of Officer Joe Pooler two years ago, according to the most recent filing in Pooler\u2019s ongoing lawsuit against the company.  Pooler was beaten for about 90 seconds in downtown in July 2016 while dispatchers managed by IXP Corp. \u2014 a New Jersey firm hired the year before to oversee the dispatch center \u2014 struggled to get the right information to nearby officers.                              The error re-ignited concerns raised by police union leaders and officers over Mayor Mark Boughton\u2019s decision to outsource dispatch duties traditionally handled by sworn officers and firefighters to civilian IXP staff.  The move to privatize the dispatch center was designed by Boughton to save the city money and allow leadership to redirect those trained officers and firefighters who had been working dispatch to positions in the field.  Despite the initial issues, the transition has worked and complaints have dropped off, said Boughton, the Republican-endorsed candidate for governor. He faces a primary challenge Aug. 14.  Pooler sued IXP last summer alleging the dispatchers\u2019 errors \u2014 including assigning Pooler to respond to his own assault \u2014 caused him to be hurt even more in the incident.    The complaint log underscores that the company knew of a number of issues and failed to properly train staff to fix them, according to the newest filing in the lawsuit by Pooler\u2019s attorney, Pat Tomasiewicz.  Police staff wrote 363 dispatch complaints in IXP\u2019s first five months alone plus another 35 through September 2016, according to the court memorandum.  \u201cA reasonable person could well conclude that failing to resolve the issues surrounding dispatch communication and services in potential emergency situations creates an unreasonable risk of bodily harm to others,\u201d Tomasiewicz wrote.  The sheer volume of complaints elevates the issue from negligence to reckless indifference, Tomasiewicz argues.  IXP Chief Operating Officer Larry Consalvos disagreed Monday, although he would not discuss the lawsuit in detail.  He acknowledged there were a series of technical issues after IXP took over the dispatch center and said those either have been corrected or implemented into the company\u2019s policies and procedures specifically for the Danbury center.  But Officer Bryan Reed, the police union president, said officers continue to have problems with the service but \u201cdidn\u2019t bother\u201d reporting them because officers feel they will not be addressed.  Reed blamed high employee turnover in the dispatch center for ongoing issues.  \u201cAs soon as these people become certified, they leave for more lucrative jobs elsewhere,\u201d Reed said. \u201cBut it\u2019s unfair that we have to take the brunt of it and we\u2019re part of their learning process. It puts all the civilians in Danbury in jeopardy, plus us going out on these calls.\u201d  It is true that there was turnover because IXP promotes from within to its other offices, but he dismissed the accusation that there are remaining problems with the Danbury operation, Consalvos said.  He declined to discuss in detail how the company will respond to the latest lawsuit filing.  \u201cObviously, it\u2019s unfortunate that officer Pooler was attacked,\u201d Consalvos said. \u201cBut we\u2019ll probably throughout the ligitation process point out a number of things that may have been done incorrectly.\u201d  IXP was to be paid $2.4 million its first year, which officials estimated would have saved the city $1 million in dispatch costs, according to previous reports.  The city has since expanded its relationship with IXP to include IT support and answering the city\u2019s 311 hotline, although neither IXP nor city staff could immediately provide the amount the company is paid each year.  \u201cWe have not had a significant amount of issues with IXP,\u201d Boughton said Monday. \u201cThere were some initial start-up issues, but now the system runs smoothly and those things have been ironed out. No system is absolutely perfect.\u201d  zach.murdock@hearstmediact.com", "id": "781"}
{"content": "July 25--The city's police oversight agency on Wednesday afternoon plans to show video to the relatives of a man fatally shot by a Chicago police officer last month.Police had said that Maurice Granton, 24, ran from plainclothes tactical officers working a drug investigation on June 6. He ignored their orders to stop, pulled a gun and was shot by one of the officers, police said.The family, which at the time of the shooting had disputed police claims that Granton had a gun, is scheduled to view the video at 1 p.m. at the Civilian Office of Police Accountability, which investigates police shootings, said attorney Andrew Stroth, who represents Granton's family with Antonio Romanucci.The Police Department released a limited video shortly after the shooting that it said showed Granton holding a gun sometime before he was shot by the officer in the Bronzeville neighborhood. The department also tweeted out a photo of a 9 mm handgun it said was recovered.\"This video is ... being released in response to claims that offender was unarmed and the weapon was planted by CPD officers,\" police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said at the time.Officers in one of the department's nerve centers -- officially known as Strategic Decision Support Centers -- had spotted Granton in a drug transaction while watching video from a police surveillance camera, according to Guglielmi. They alerted officers on patrol who responded to 47th Street and Prairie Avenue to confront Granton, he said.Granton was pronounced dead at the University of Chicago Medical Center. He had been shot in the back, according to the Cook County medical examiner's office.Granton had been treated at the same hospital just days before for a graze wound near his right eye. He refused to cooperate with police after officers found him lying in an alley in the South Side's Chatham neighborhood, authorities said then.Granton had two young daughters, according to his sister, Joanna Varnado, who said at the time of his fatal shooting that she did not believe he had a gun.\"I just want to know what the real story is,\" she said . \"If it was (police) misconduct, I want justice. My brother was 24 years old. He loved his girls. That's all he lived for was his kids.\"Granton had two convictions for robbery and theft and several arrests on suspicion of trespassing and drug possession.But his family said that with the birth of his two daughters, Granton's criminal behavior was in the past. His last arrest was in 2016, records show.\"Since when does running validate somebody getting shot?\" Varnado said at the time. \"I don't understand that. You're not being offensive, you're being defensive.\"The shooting happened around 8:10 p.m. June 6 and sparked tense confrontations between police and the family at the hospital. Granton was pronounced dead there about half an hour after he was shot, but relatives said they were not told for several hours.Family and friends first gathered in the waiting room, then were told to move outside, where a hospital official addressed the growing crowd. He told them there were three gunshot victims in the emergency room and they were waiting for identification.Around 10:30 p.m., family members and hospital officials began loudly arguing about where they could wait. Authorities tried to usher members of the crowd into another lobby nearby, but they insisted on staying outside the emergency room lobby.Security outside the emergency room grew to more than a dozen officers, from both the Chicago and University of Chicago police departments. The officers formed a line in front of the entrance and said the area was on lockdown.Police eventually let Varnado and a few other family members inside. Around 11:45 p.m., Varnado walked back out. She stood next to Tayshia Shaw, who has two daughters with Granton, a 1-year-old and another who has not yet had her first birthday.\"No, he's not,\" Shaw said. \"No ...\"Shaw dropped to the sidewalk, lying on her left side. Varnado sat cross-legged with Shaw's head in her lap, and the women tried to comfort each other as they cried.The hospital later released a statement defending its handling of the crowd, saying it \"always has been committed to and focused on the safety and privacy of patients and their families. Like other hospitals across the country, UChicago Medicine has well-established and comprehensive policies and procedures in place designed to protect patients, their families and staff.\"dhinkel@chicagotribune.comasweeney@chicagotribune.comjgorner@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "782"}
{"content": "July 26--Miley Cyrus, Lance Bass and their respective partners -- now that's a blended family we'd be interested in watching -- are among those who have shown interest in purchasing \"The Brady Bunch\" house, according to Us Weekly. The Studio City home recently went on the market for nearly $2 million.\"Miley Cyrus and Lance Bass are both very interested in buying it,\" a source told the publication.But unfortunately Cyrus and Bass are looking to buy separately, not together. There goes \"The Brady Bunch\" reboot idea.Among the property's selling points -- three bedrooms, maid's quarters, one bathroom, a large backyard to accommodate potato-sack races, a deck that can withstand volcanic science projects and a converted attic where you can hide the stolen goat mascot from your rival high school.OK, so the sitcom was actually shot on a soundstage, but the home now for sale was used for exterior shots that opened and closed the show, which ran from 1969-74 before living in perpetuity through reruns.The split-level house was built in 1959 and last sold in 1973 for $61,000. It's reportedly a time capsule to \"The Brady Bunch\" era.Its long-time owners recently died and left the split-level home to three grandchildren.\"They had no idea their house was going to become the second most photographed home in all of America next to the white house and as the years went on, 'The Brady Bunch' just kept getting more and more popular and the house appeared on more and more star maps,\" said Kelsey McCallister Wittmer, one of the grandchildren.The house will forever be tied to the beloved sitcom.

{"content": "GOOGLE EAST. On Wednesday, investigative outlet The Intercept published a report detailing Google\u2019s plans to create a censored search engine for China.A whistleblower provided the site with internal documents on the project, codename Dragonfly, which launched in the spring of 2017. Through Dragonfly, Google is building a special Android search app that follows the Chinese government\u2019s strict censorship guidelines.The government has already seen a version of the app, and the final product could launch in the nation within the next six to nine months, according to The Intercept\u2019s report.A SHIFT IN SENTIMENT. China already keeps a tight rein on the information its citizens can access online. Tens of thousands of \u201cinternet monitors\u201d sit at the ready to remove any content the government deems inappropriate. Citizens can\u2019t use unapproved words (such as \u201cdisagree\u201d) online, nor can they access Facebook, Instagram, The New York Times \u2014 and, yes, Google \u2014 that are popular elsewhere in the world. In some cases, homegrown apps that accomplish similar functions have popped up.Google wasn\u2019t always banned, though. From 2006 to 2010, Google provided Chinese citizens with a censored version of its search engine, stirring up intense backlash from the U.S. government. \u201cGoogle has seriously compromised its \u2018don\u2019t be evil\u2019 policy,\u201d Rep. Chris Smith (R-NJ) said during a 2006 congressional hearing. \u201cIndeed, it has become evil\u2019s accomplice.\u201dIn March 2010, Google bowed to the pressure back home, granting Chinese users access to an uncensored version of the site. The company cited the Chinese government\u2019s increased attempts to censor web content and limit free speech as one of the reasons for the move. Shortly thereafter, China officially blocked Google, which meant citizens could no longer access the site at all.At the time, this was a solid move for Google, both for its PR and for its finances. But things change, and Google\u2019s decision to return to China confirms that U.S. sentiment on censorship is shifting \u2014 maybe restricting access to some information online is OK, after all.FOLLOW THE WORLD LEADER. Indeed, recent events back in the U.S. show that we\u2019re just generally more chill with censorship. Net neutrality is now a thing of the past, clearing the way for corporate control and restriction to certain kinds of content. President Trump has established a national discourse that consistently antagonizes the press and even encourages government censorship of the media.With 750 million internet users, China is a huge untapped market for Google. The move to launch a censored search engine in the nation is likely to be great for both Google\u2019s stock and its shareholders.Google has already proven it\u2019s more comfortable in moral gray areas these days. Now that the U.S. government is less likely to discourage Google from helping a government censor its media, why wouldn\u2019t Google cash in on the opportunity?", "id": "784"}
{"content": "July 31--If the Bears allowed optics to influence their decisions, they could use Thursday night's nationally televised Hall of Fame Game as a commercial for rookie linebacker Roquan Smith.The Bears would acquiesce in the complex contract dispute keeping Smith out of training camp, announce a deal before kickoff and introduce him to America during a three-hour celebration of inside linebackers. The symmetry of the Bears signing Smith and the Hall inducting Brian Urlacher, with Dick Butkus and Mike Singletary looking on in gold jackets, would maximize the moment for a franchise that takes pride in its tradition at the position.Alas, the ongoing staredown between Smith and the Bears threatens to thwart all the progress made during a productive offseason. Smith remains the only unsigned draft pick among the 256 players selected in April. In a collision sport, the Bears' quest to avoid precedent and perhaps make the game safer has clashed with the need to win.So far, the biggest casualty is common sense.General manager Ryan Pace has more to lose the longer this drags than Smith, a major reason the Bears need to make whatever concessions necessary. Pace, beginning his fourth season after the Bears went 14-34 in his first three, must give new coach Matt Nagy every resource possible for his first season -- and that includes the potential leader of the defense who's capable of starting Week 1.Both sides have valid reasons for their respective stances on an issue too open for interpretation, a bridge no draft pick had to cross a year ago. The woebegone Bears, who gradually changed the vibe around Halas Hall since firing John Fox and hiring Nagy, have a bigger impetus to end the impasse. That doesn't make Smith more right than the Bears. That merely recognizes the player is more likely than the team to emerge from a public debate unscathed. The Bears haven't won a playoff game since 2010, let alone the benefit of the doubt in Chicago.The holdup revolves around contract language affecting the Bears' ability to void Smith's guaranteed money if he gets suspended under the NFL's new rule legislating helmet contact in the name of player safety.The rule prohibits \"using any part of a player's helmet to butt, spear or ram an opponent.\" Nobody doubts that players who violate it will be flagged for unnecessary roughness, ejected and possibly suspended. But nobody knows what criteria officials will use to apply the provision, ambiguity that led draft picks such as Bills outside linebacker Tremaine Edmunds and Jets quarterback Sam Darnold to get their teams to acknowledge formally they wouldn't go after guaranteed money.Oddly, the Bears refuse to budge. Smith's agents want the front office to stipulate it won't void any guarantees if he gets suspended. A linebacker as explosive and aggressive as Smith figures to engage his helmet often making tackles or taking on blocks. A source said the Bears assured Smith they wouldn't seek any guaranteed money in the event of a suspension, and they have history to back up their word: They didn't try to recoup money when linebacker Danny Trevathan was suspended one game for his hit on Packers receiver Davante Adams. That qualifies as a good-faith guarantee.So why would the Bears balk at putting that in writing the way other teams have? The answer remains unclear, a strategy so defining that you suspect Chairman George McCaskey and President Ted Phillips helped devise it.Perhaps the Bears' stubbornness has been persuaded by the player safety movement sweeping through all levels of football. It might seem noble if the Bears held steadfast on the Smith matter because they objected to protecting a player from the consequences of making illegal hits. But such a stance also would be naive in a bottom-line league.An organization that hasn't had a winning season since 2012 can't afford to take a philosophical stand that hurts the team as much as keeping Smith out of the huddle does. The Bears defense needs Smith making plays more than the NFL needs the Bears setting an example for safety reform.Stop comparing Smith's plight to the 31-day standoff in 2016 between the Chargers and pass rusher Joey Bosa, the No. 3 pick that year. Bosa missed the first four weeks of that season because of a pulled hamstring, the kind of soft-tissue injury players who miss camp often suffer. At 6-foot-5 and 280 pounds, Bosa also had one job: Get to the quarterback.In contrast, Smith communicates with every layer of the defense and relies on athleticism as much as instinct, which only improves with repetition. Ideally, Smith will play in three exhibition games and start Sept. 9 against the Packers.By taking such a hard line, the Bears have allowed themselves to be ruled by the exception. NFL executive vice president of football operations Troy Vincent said only three plays out of 40,000 reviewed during the 2017 season would have resulted in an ejection under the new guidelines.That seems too infrequent for the Bears to insist on avoiding a precedent for future contracts. It seems wrong to want to preserve the right to void a contract guarantee based on on-field conduct. Smith's request seems anything but outrageous.Eventually, the NFL Players Association should get involved to develop a uniform policy all 32 teams follow concerning suspensions and guaranteed money. Inconsistencies between the way the Bears and, say, the Jets and Bills deal with the issue only increase the complexity and confusion.Until then, the Bears face a decision that greatly affects their 2018 season. The collective bargaining agreement slots Smith to earn $18.7 million over four years with an $11.5 million signing bonus. This really isn't about money.It's about how much the Bears value organizational momentum.dhaugh@chicagotribune.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "785"}

Never in a million years did anyone think the Rams would have a chance at competing after winning just four games the year before, but thanks to  quickly changing the culture, this team is now viewed as legitimate threat, and appears to be built for years to come.Expectations were already high for 2018 when the offseason officially got underway following the team\u2019s playoff loss to the Atlanta Falcons in January, but Los Angeles took the hype to a whole new level by becoming one of the big winners from the offseason. Whether it was the unexpected signing of Ndamukong Suh or the surprise trade to acquire Brandin Cooks, the Rams have been in a win-now mode over the last few months, and it\u2019s going to be exciting to see how this all plays out during McVay\u2019s second season as head coach.For a team that had previously struggled to be a contender in the NFC, it\u2019s amazing to see Los Angeles in this current position with these high expectations at the start of training camp.

{"content": "July 31--New coach Matt Nagy's Bears team will be scrutinized even before kickoff Thursday at the Hall of Fame Game in Canton, Ohio.The Bears and Ravens play the NFL's first exhibition game of the year then, and the league and the NFL Players Association have yet to announce a resolution to their discussions about the rule that would regulate how players act during the national anthem.Amid ongoing debate about whether players should be allowed to kneel during the anthem to protest social injustices, NFL owners decided this spring to require them to either stand or stay in the locker room and allowed penalties for protests on the field. The NFLPA filed a grievance in early July against the new rule, and the NFL announced it would not implement it until the two sides have finished their discussions.As of now, that leaves the Bears and Ravens on their own for determining their course of action Thursday.Bears coach Matt Nagy has put off talking about how his team will handle it -- whether they will stand on the sideline or stay in the locker room, and if any protesting player would be punished. He said Tuesday the players have had conversations about the action they will take and that the team would finalize it before the game.\"But I feel really, really good with where we're at,\" Nagy said. \"I feel comfortable, and I know this: Whatever we do, we're going to do it together.\"Bears outside linebacker and NFLPA rep Sam Acho also expects the team to be in unison, even if it means compromise from some parties.\"We come from so many different backgrounds and experiences, so it's going to be hard to figure out one solution that fits everyone,\" Acho said. \"But the great thing about a team is when you do something for your brothers, you're doing it for yourself. And so even if you don't believe wholeheartedly in some issue, you believe in your teammates, so you do it for your teammates.\"If precedent gives any insight into how the Bears will handle it, Chairman George McCaskey made it known in June he believes players should stand for the anthem, and no player from the Bears last season protested during it.The issue played out prominently in Week 3 of the 2017 season following President Donald Trump's comments and tweets that players should be suspended or fired for not standing and that fans should boycott the league until such actions were taken.The Bears played the Steelers at Soldier Field that week, and while all but one of the Steelers players remained in the locker room for the anthem, Bears players stood on the sideline shoulder to shoulder, many of them linking arms.But Bears players like Acho and safety Adrian Amos also want to make it clear they feel deeply about the social justice issues that are at the root of the protests. They want to make sure that the fight against those problems isn't lost.\"I do want people to know that I'm aware of the stuff that's going on,\" Amos said. \"I'm aware that there are a lot of injustices. And I don't really like when people tell us that we're not supposed to use our platform for certain things. Because when we use our platform for things that other people like or that will affect other people, then it's OK.\"But since this is something that a minority group deals with, it's not seen as important. So it's like, 'Just play football and be quiet.' I don't like that. Just like when you have LeBron (James) and you're telling him to shut up and dribble, but he's building a whole school.

{"content": "With the opening practice of Dallas Cowboys camp taking place this evening, it\u2019s only fitting to predict the standout players of the summer.Predicting the camp standouts would seem like a cut and dry exercise. The natural tendency is to choose the most accomplished player in each position group.However, the reality is not always so black and white. Playing time differences, veteran rest days, and added competition often provide performance surprises.Since practices and preseason games have different attributes, a more productive way to handle this is naming the position standouts for each portion.Without further ado, let\u2019s jump right into predicting which players will shine in camp.QUARTERBACKPractice MVP \u2013 DAK PRESCOTTPreseason MVP \u2013 COOPER RUSHANALYSIS:  will get the bulk of practice snaps. He\u2019s yet to become a consistently accurate practice player, but neither have his back-ups. In preseason games, Rush and rookie Mike White will split the majority of snaps. Rush proved to be a gamer lighting up the preseason last August. Expect more of the same throwing to a deeper, more competitive receiver group.RUNNING BACKPractice MVP \u2013 EZEKIEL ELLIOTTPreseason MVP \u2013 DARIUS JACKSONANALYSIS: Again the running back starter is far more talented than the substitutes. Even with limited snaps, Ezekiel Elliott will steal the show in practice. Just as Rush excelled last year, Jackson was the preseason rushing star in 2016. Behind a shuffling offensive line, the more complete, veteran back-up will outperform bruising rookie Bo Scarborough.WIDE RECEIVERPractice MVP \u2013 COLE BEASLEYPreseason MVP \u2013 MICHAEL GALLUPANALYSIS: Covering Cole Beasley has been the most grueling task in camp practices for two years running. Without the defense scheming to stop him, the single coverage beatings will continue. With key veterans Allen Hurns, Beasley, Tavon Austin and Terrance Williams receiving limited snaps, a new face will emerge in games. Gallup will get ample work to prepare for a regular season role. The rookie will deliver with excellent route running and great hands.TIGHT ENDPractice MVP \u2013 BLAKE JARWINPreseason MVP \u2013 RICO GATHERSANALYSIS: Jarwin is the best receiving threat of the group and will produce the biggest receptions. Geoff Swaim\u2018s blocking will be huge for the season, but that aspect rarely gets much fanfare in summer practice. August is do or die for Gathers in Dallas. He should receive ample game opportunities to produce as the Cowboys decide whether to continue the project or cut bait.OFFENSIVE LINEPractice MVP \u2013 ZACK MARTINPreseason MVP \u2013 MARCUS MARTINANALYSIS: Both starting defensive tackles will miss much or all of camp. Zack Martin will have the advantage to rule practice. Jihad Ward may provide a test, but he\u2019ll wreck the lesser subs. OL starters play a decent amount in games, but back-ups get the bulk of work. Former 49ers starter (Marcus) Martin will prove to be a road grader against inexperienced tackles.DEFENSIVE LINEPractice MVP \u2013 DEMARCUS LAWRENCEPreseason MVP \u2013 KONY EALYANALYSIS: DeMarcus Lawrence will be the most talented defensive lineman at practice by far. His franchise player designation says as much. War Daddies don\u2019t retreat in practice. Newly signed Kony Ealy will get heavy game snaps to cement a reliable rotational role. With 15 sacks in 19 career starts, he should whip opposing backup tackles.LINEBACKERPractice MVP \u2013 JAYLON SMITHPreseason MVP \u2013 CHRIS COVINGTONANALYSIS: Sean Lee will receive limited snaps, while Jaylon Smith will be blinded by spotlights. Fortunately, he\u2019s got everything to prove and will do so loudly. Some caution will be used with Leighton Vander Esch\u2019s game minutes, so I\u2019ll go with the wildcard rookie Covington to lead in game tackles.CORNERBACKPractice MVP \u2013 CHIDOBE AWUZIEPreseason MVP \u2013 DUKE THOMASANALYSIS: Jourdan Lewis is the best cover corner, but will face receiving MVP Beasley often in the slot. Chidobe Awuzie will draw easier outside match-ups to nudge out Lewis. Thomas excelled with extended game snaps last summer and will turn heads again.SAFETYPractice MVP \u2013 XAVIER WOODSPreseason MVP \u2013 XAVIER WOODSANALYSIS: Xavier Woods will take a big step and emerge as the best safety on the team. Well, unless no big names are added soon. With only three safeties good enough to make the final cut, Woods will outshine all others even on limited game snaps.", "id": "789"}
{"content": "You\u2019re taking a 12-question biology test. You get 10 questions right and 2 questions wrong. You decide, \u201cI\u2019m stupid.\u201d You tell a joke that your friends don\u2019t quite get. You decide, \u201cI always play the fool.\u201d Your boyfriend breaks up with you. You decide, \u201cI\u2019m unlovable.\u201dWhen we lack self acceptance we bully ourselves into a rigid pursuit of perfectionism. We mercilessly judge, critique and flog ourselves into an impossible quest that dooms us to failure, guarantees unhappiness, and even induces physical and mental health problems. According to Richard Holden\u2019s book, \u201cHappiness Now!\u201d, \u201cHappiness and self acceptance go hand in hand.\u201d      Here are some suggestions for finding self acceptance:LAUD YOUR STRENGTHSMany people scrutinize perceived weakness and are dismissive of their strengths. The more we think about these shortcomings, the more ingrained they become, until they cast a long shadow over our merits. You can focus on your virtues and abilities by writing them down. If you\u2019re struggling to write a list, simply write down one thing a day (and don\u2019t criticize yourself for not writing more).You can begin with something simple, such as, \u201cI\u2019m compassionate.\u201d As the list grows, the old script withers. You\u2019ll start recognizing your strengths, such as intelligence, creativity, problem solving and leadership.     Reinforce your self-esteem by listing the challenges you\u2019ve surmounted, the goals you\u2019ve achieved and the lives you\u2019ve touched. Keep adding to this list.FORGIVE YOURSELFIt\u2019s often easier to forgive others than to forgive ourselves. Past regrets can hobble our pursuit of self-love. Forgive yourself and move on. Learn from your mistake, use it as an opportunity for growth and remember that you can\u2019t change the past. Remind yourself that you\u2019re not that person anymore. If guilt bubbles up, tell yourself, \u201cWhen I made this decision I didn\u2019t know what I know now.\u201dSILENCE YOUR INNER CRITICOur brain is wired with negativity bias,a type of radar that seeks out negativity in order to protect us. This early warning system served our prehistoric ancestors well when a predator was looming. Now, however, our brain vilifies minor things such as a misplaced set of keys, a bad haircut \u2014 triggering our inner critic to pounce on and magnify small infractions one hundredfold.     When the inner critic throws a tantrum, manipulating you to believe, \u201cIf I lose, I\u2019m a failure,\u201d it can help to repeat a calming, supportive mantra such as, \u201cI\u2019m only human and I\u2019m doing the best I can with what I know right now.\u201d The critic thrives on black and white statements. Take comfort in the fact that our errors and shortcomings can be positively regarded as chances for growth and acceptance of self.FORGET ABOUT IMPRESSING OTHERSWe often fixate on finding acceptance by \u201clooking good\u201d to others, and beat ourselves up if their reaction is lukewarm or nonexistent. We seek their validation that we\u2019re smart, accomplished, lovable, and base our own assessments of ourselves on theirs. This also puts us in a miserable place of subjugation.On your path to acceptance of yourself, know that if you cater to others and try to do so without failing or having missteps, your fear of mistakes will make you live so hesitantly that you\u2019re not really living at all. What you can achieve has nothing to do with what others think is possible for you.BE KIND TO YOURSELFMany people refuse to allow themselves even a morsel of kindness because they believe that it is selfish, undeserved or a sign of weakness. Weakness, however, is part of being human. When you love yourself you discover acceptance of yourself. Accepting yourself germinates when you love yourself because of your flaws, not despite them.You don\u2019t have to swim the English Channel, marry a rock star, or write a bestseller for your achievements to have meaning and value. What about the rose bushes you nurtured that finally burst into blossoms? Or your diligent couponing that slashed $30 off your last grocery bill? How about the first time your child tied his shoes?When you acknowledge the small stuff, these achievements build upon each other to strengthen your sense of competence and confidence. In his book, \u201cThe Power of Habit,\u201d Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, Charles Duhigg says, \u201cResearch has shown that small wins have enormous power and influence disproportionate to the accomplishments of the victories themselves.\u201dWe \u2014 not the outside world \u2014 can be our own worst enemies, sabotaging acceptance of ourselves with grueling self-judgment, criticism and loathing. As a result, we don\u2019t grow, and our world becomes smaller and smaller, constricting like a noose around our neck. Happily, this doesn\u2019t seal your fate.Self acceptance is your birthright, and these tips can help you achieve it.", "id": "790"}
{"content": "Aug. 01--On Thursday at 4 p.m., a protest group plans to shut down a stretch of North Lake Shore Drive for an anti-violence march to Wrigley Field. We don't know how many people will participate, but the group's threat to snarl rush hour traffic already has accomplished one goal: to be heard, and taken seriously.Thursday evening will be busy in Chicago, with an evening Cubs game at Wrigley Field and Lollapalooza in Grant Park. Anyone planning to be out and about on the North Side or trying to commute home should consider taking public transportation or an alternate route, and bring some patience.Yes, this march -- assuming it does occur -- will frustrate and annoy many Chicagoans. It risks alienating people. By design.Participants will rally to demand safer, more hopeful communities on the South and West sides with better schools and more job opportunities. In essence, they'll be marching in envy of the neighborhoods that will surround them as they proceed.If they held their demonstration at, say, the quiet corner of South Laflin and 77th Street, who would notice? What's more, protest organizers say they won't coordinate with city officials to mitigate traffic headaches because they are demonstrating against Mayor Rahm Emanuel's leadership. \"Did Dr. King talk strategy with Bull Connor?\" is how the Rev. Gregory Livingston put it, referring to the Alabama lawman who in the 1960s directed fire hoses and attack dogs on civil rights marchers in Birmingham.We want the Chicago protesters to stay safe, and we don't advocate that they break the law. We do hope their message gets a wider audience over an extended period of time -- as in, during the unfolding campaigns for mayor and City Council.If you made a list of the major challenges facing Chicago -- the problems that hold the city back from being its best self -- you'd have to include many of the issues protest organizers cite, including: gun violence and mistrust of police; lack of economic opportunity in impoverished neighborhoods; the need to improve Chicago Public Schools. Of course, the protest leaders put their spin on those topics, including calls for the resignation of Emanuel and police Superintendent Eddie Johnson.But what we're looking at here is an example of community members pressing City Hall for results. And whaddya know, Chicagoans will go to the polls on Feb. 26 in city elections. Imagine the implications across this city if more and more citizens demand action on chronic crises on which many candidates don't have much to say.Chicago needs more voices impatient with gun violence, mediocre schools and economic disparities between communities. Chicago also needs residents from all neighborhoods to help hold the city to its promise to reform policing, and then get involved in the fight against crime by supporting cops on the beat.The more Chicagoans engage and push for positive changes, the more this next election becomes a referendum on ways to make Chicago a more successful, livable city for all residents. We count 10 challengers who want to defeat Emanuel. Every City Council seat will be up for election.We've been writing about the reluctance of many candidates to speak about much more than their pet issues. We want all the candidates to bring their A-games, with ideas to reduce shootings and homicides, revitalize struggling neighborhoods, improve the city's financial condition, continue the turnaround of CPS. Then voters will decide.Chicagoans can wait and hope for the best -- or they can demand better. That quest for solutions is what elections are about. It's also the message of Thursday's protest.___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "791"}
{"content": "Einstein\u2019s theory of general relativity holds true even in the extreme gravitational force coming from a supermassive black hole, researchers found. This is the latest in a string of rigorous tests the 103-year-old theory has passed. ( ESO/M. Kornmesser )Einstein's theory of relativity has passed the most rigorous test to date, this time withstanding the super-strong gravitational field of a supermassive black hole.This is the latest in a series of demonstrations of Einstein's 103-year-old theory of general relativity applied in the most extreme circumstances.Previously, scientists have proven that Einstein's explanation of how the universe works stands in the face of highly dense neutron stars and mysterious particles called ghost neutrinos.They also found an entire galaxy that bends space itself and, in 2015, discovered gravitational waves, ripples in the fabric of space-time.Relativity Theory Can Withstand A Black HoleAn international team of scientists studying Sagittarius A*, the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way, has found that, even in the vicinity of the strongest gravitational field in the galaxy, Einstein's relativity applies.The team specifically examined S2, a star that circles Sagittarius A*, and measured its velocity and orbit as it came to its closest point to the black hole.They found that S2 behaved exactly as Einstein predicted. At such a close distance to an object with a much stronger gravitational field, the star exhibited a phenomenon called gravitational redshifting.The study, which is published in the Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics journal, is the culmination of more than a quarter of a century of observation by a team of experts led by Reinhard Genzel of the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics at Garching, Germany.Genzel says this is the second time the team observed S2 making its closest pass to Sagittarius A*. However, they were able to make observations at unprecedented resolutions with the development of new instruments.\"We have been preparing intensely for this event over several years, as we wanted to make the most of this unique opportunity to observe general relativistic effects,\" says Genzel.What Is Gravitational Redshifting?S2 is one of three stars orbiting the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way, which is about 26,000 light-years from Earth.In May, the researchers observed S2 passing dangerously close to Sagittarius A* at around 12 billion miles away from the black hole. This is roughly four times the distance from the Sun to Neptune.At this point, the star is so close to the black hole that its proximity speeds it up to 15 million miles per hour, which is nearly 3 percent the speed of light.According to Einstein, the black hole's gravitational field is so strong that it stretches out the light of the star to longer wavelengths, pulling it toward the red end of the electromagnetic spectrum. This phenomenon is called gravitational redshifting.New Equipment Used To Study Black HoleObserving the region of Sagittarius A* has proven to be challenging for experts. The center of the galaxy is clouded by a thick veil of dust, which makes observations of visible light almost impossible.Using highly advanced instruments in the Very Large Telescope at the European Southern Observatory in Chile, Genzel's team were able to see through the dusty veil and take infrared and near-infrared measurements of S2.The researchers used the SINFONI near-infrared spectrograph to determine the star's velocity in conjunction with the GRAVITY interferometer to map out S2's positions as it moved around the black hole.Frank Eisenhauer, principal investigator for both instruments, says the team first made measurements of S2 two years ago.\"During the close passage, we could even detect the faint glow around the black hole on most of the images, which allowed us to precisely follow the star on its orbit, ultimately leading to the detection of the gravitational redshift in the spectrum of S2,\" he says.", "id": "792"}
{"content": "Minnesota Wild fans are very familiar with Jared Spurgeon and his value to this team. Preseason puck drop is 46 days away, so there is no better time to preview #46.Jared Spurgeon is entering his 9th season at the NHL level, as a defensive mainstay where he has spent the majority of the last couple seasons on the top defensive pairing alongside Ryan Suter. Spurgeon has developed his game to be a consistent piece of the back 6 for the Minnesota Wild, providing a reliable 30 points per season over the last 3 seasons while taking minimal penalty minutes and being responsible defensively as well. HistorySpurgeon followed up his 2016-17 career year (38 points in 76 games, 20 penalty minutes) with a very comparable 2017-18 for the Minnesota Wild (37 points in 61 games, 8 penalty minutes). The major downfall to his game last season, was a drop in plus/minus (+33 to -6). This drastic drop was not localized to Spurgeon however, as a large number of Wild players saw career high plus/minus stats from 2016-17 take a drastic fall last season. This is likely attributed to better overall team preparation of opposing teams following an outstanding year.While Spurgeon has provided a reliable and consistent offensive and defensive presence whenever he takes the ice, his biggest detraction has been overall durability. Jared has never played more than 77 games in a single regular season, and only twice has managed more than 70.Whether by injury or sickness, it has become an expected occurrence for Spurgeon to miss at least a handful of games every season. These missed games disrupt team chemistry as well as Spurgeon\u2019s personal game consistency, as it takes both the team and himself time to adapt to periods away from the ice. Season PreviewThis could be a very telling season for Jared Spurgeon and his future with the Minnesota Wild. As an undersized player with durability concerns on a team with an increasing amount of defensive prospect depth, Spurgeon could soon find his place on the team changing. Jared Spurgeon has become accustomed to spending the majority of his ice time alongside Ryan Suter on the top pairing. However, during Suter and Spurgeon\u2019s injuries at the end of last season, Mathew Dumba performed admirably in an increased role on the top pair and may see a promotion to fill the spot beside Suter. I would not be surprised to see Spurgeon relegated to the second pairing alongside Jonas Brodin over the course of this season, if he doesn\u2019t start the season there. Second pairing may actually benefit Jared, though, by taking him away from the defensive responsibilities of matching up with opposing top lines and allowing him room to use his offensive abilities more. As an undersized, offensively gifted defenseman with a great outlet pass, vision to hit his targets in stride, and the hockey awareness to jump into plays in the opposing zone there is still a ton of upside to Jared Spurgeon maintaining his spot on this team. Spurgeon will turn 29 this season, which is amazing to think since it feels like he has been a member of the Minnesota Wild for so long. He still has plenty of time left in his career, but it may not be as a member of the Wild for too much longer. Offensive skill, defensive capability, and the young players coming up from the minors could be pushing Spurgeon out the door. If he is unwilling to waive his No-Trade Clause, then he is guaranteed to remain for 2 more seasons still. Should he waive it to allow GM Fenton to move him, we should see a solid return for a reliable, productive, team-first player.Want your voice heard? Join the Gone Puck Wild team!I would personally love to see Jared adapt to more of a veteran leadership role, and possibly take on some additional offensive responsibilities on a bottom pairing. He is well liked among the Minnesota Wild fan base and has earned the franchise\u2019s trust in him, but I don\u2019t know if he has a long term place on this team anymore.", "id": "793"}
{"content": "July 31--Legendary artist Oscar Chavez is 24 -- approximately 48 in internet years -- making this the prime time for his first retrospective.Enter \"Fashion Nova Presents: Carpe DM\" showing at the Chicago Artists Coalition. A South Side native with \"absolutely no affiliation\" with the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Chavez earned his degree in studio arts from the University of Illinois at Chicago last year and is capping off his BOLT residency with this new curation, which he says honors both queer history and youth-driven digital cultures.The following is an edited transcript from a phone interview with the artist.Chicago Tribune: Having a retrospective at your age is a new concept. How did that come to fruition?Oscar Chavez: I graduated from undergrad last year, and this is a show that is a retrospective of my entire artistic career, which I think is super fun. It's spanned painting and performance, and the show itself has wearable works in it. I think of that as the medium between painting and performance. At UIC, they let you do whatever you want and figure it out, which I loved.Q: How did you figure it out?A: I am from the South Side of Chicago, which continues to shape the way I explore the arts community here. In college, I was making photos, I was making performances, I was making paintings, I was making everything under the sun and then really just learning how to edit it all down. I worked there and then applied to BOLT. That was kind of a crazy long shot, because I don't have my MFA or teaching experience. I had that delusional confidence of a millennial who hasn't had to deal with life yet. I find that in my work, too -- I have stuff to say, and I'm just going to keep putting it out there. I think it's really funny.Q: I really admire the fanged femininity of your wearable pieces. Where did you find the impulse to create these?A: A lot of it began with performances. I would be making these costumes inspired by other artists with distinct personal style. I've always loved thinking about personal style, and getting dressed every day is a long performance for me. It's such a fun way of presenting yourself. There was a performance that I did that was inspired by a moment when a lot of luxury brands co-opted protest language for their clothing. I explored the questions that arose: What is the real power in what you put on your body? What does that get across? That really pushed a ton of different works into performances. In this show, all of my wearables are going to be there on a rail for people to try on, which I think is going to be really fun. I'm really interested in how other people are going to engage with them.Q: And your queer identity plays a big role in the work.A: I come from a queer history and lineage that embraces camp and drag. I think drag has become more nuanced as time goes on -- it's less about performing another gender and more about presenting an idealized self in the world. I think we're always performing a version of that, especially with social media and our multiplicities of identities. We're always performing, we're always dressing up. I did a performance in a dress that said, \"My solo show opens July 27.\" It was about being in full drag and going to events in a wig and makeup in a way that looked ridiculous, but the text was out there and you had to deal with it when you saw me.Q: Talk to me more about your aesthetic. How did you develop it?A: I have an investment in old-school glamour expressed in cheap ways. I feel super fortunate to come from a generation that has those queer ancestors. People usually bring up John Waters and stuff like that -- this glamour that's kind of dirty. For example, I love tulle because it's so cheap and you can do so much with it. I love long, opera-length gloves that are glamorous and also ridiculous. Coming as a queer kid from underprivileged communities where glamour wasn't something I interacted with a lot, it's something that I push now. It's a lifestyle. You see people when they put on a glove, and they look at the themselves in the mirror. It feels really great.Q: But, like you said, it's not just a matter of lookin' good.A: I've had people talk with me about my work and its concepts of self-autonomy -- the way that I exist and present myself in these spaces. I've also made a lot of work in feminine and gay male spaces.Q: How have social media and the internet informed your work?I think my work is much more about the cross-cultural interactions that happen because of the internet. I'm not making work about the internet, I'm making work from it. I'm making work about being raised on it. I'm making work using the languages and the tools that the internet has made for us. In many ways, many of my paintings are memes. They don't really look like memes, but they work in similar ways. They're compacting all of this history onto a flat surface and asking people to unpack it. You have the tools to do it if you've been raised on the internet, raised in these subcultures created from there.Q: There's a total fluency -- the internet's language is how you came into articulating your fully realized, adult self.A: It feels very natural. The idea of that dress -- I knew that people were going to take pictures of me, so that text got pushed even further, past the people who were actually in that space. It's an awareness that, yes, I am a person who exists in the world, but I am also a person who exists on the internet, and I am a person who is going to exist in people's minds past that.\"Fashion Nova Presents: Carpe DM\" is on exhibition through Aug. 16 at Chicago Artists Coalition, 2130 W.

{"content": "July 28--On Friday afternoon, goaltender Cam Ward had yet to wear a Blackhawks jersey. For 13 years, he has been wearing red-and-black Carolina Hurricanes jerseys.\"I'm not going to lie,\" he said. \"It is going to be really strange.\"A few hours later, he walked onto a stage wearing a No. 30 Hawks sweater as fans roared at the annual Blackhawks Convention.Life as anything other than a Hurricanes player is taking some getting used to, Ward said. But he's eager to join the Blackhawks, where uncertainty surrounds the health of goaltender Corey Crawford. He's expected to be Crawford's backup.Ward, 34, was one of three players the Hawks picked up in free agency, signing him to a one-year $3 million deal. His veteran leadership and experience will be valuable after last year's rotation of backups struggled when Crawford went out in late December.As a rookie with Carolina, Ward won the Conn Smythe Trophy during a run to the 2006 Stanley Cup and remained the starter until last year when the Hurricanes signed former Blackhawk Scott Darling. But Darling struggled and Ward wound up starting 42 games with a 2.73 goals-against average and .906 save percentage.\"Most teams, you have to have three or four goalies to feel comfortable playing,\" Hawks general manager Stan Bowman said. \"Cam has a lot of experience. He's been through some pressure situations. There's a comfort level knowing that if he's required to carry a load, he's done that before.\"Ward said his objective in Chicago is to be prepared for anything.\"Hopefully I can bring some of that experience and my success earlier in my career and when called upon be able to perform,\" he said.Ward sounded like someone making a job change in the later stages of his career. He had yet to meet Crawford or many other players before the convention, and marveled at the crowd of Blackhawks fans at the convention.\"Are you kidding me?\" he said. \"I'm really nervous sitting here. This is all new to me.\"It's not just an adjustment for Ward. He said he was eager to find a new team in a city that would be beneficial to his wife, Cody, 7-year-old son and 5-year-old daughter. He found a home on the 35th floor of a downtown high-rise and sought advice on where to enroll his children in school.\"I was able to get some new swag for my kids and see them wear it for the first time,\" Ward said. \"(We're) kind of surrounding ourselves with new hats and pictures and trying to get used to the reality of where I'm going to be this year.\"\"It's going to be a different way of living,\" he said. \"We're looking at it as a family adventure, and I'm looking at it as a great opportunity in my career.\"Ward calls this a new chapter -- personally and professionally.\"I was fortunate and blessed to be in Carolina for 13 years,\" he said. \"It's got me to here. I was pleased and excited with the phone call I got July 1 (from the Blackhawks) and wanted to jump at the opportunity. I look at this team that has a great core group of guys.

{"content": "Aug. 04--Griffin Cermak hates crowds.But here was the 21-year-old clinging for dear life to the barricade at the Bud Light Stage as Lollapalooza headliner Travis Scott roared onto the stage Thursday night.Cermak got to the festival when the gates opened at noon to see Scott, his favorite rapper. Cermak has been a fan since Scott's 2014 \"Days Before Rodeo\" mixtape, and has been plotting to see him perform ever since. \"I'm claustrophobic, but I knew that this was a once in a lifetime experience, especially with his new album \"Astroworld\" dropping (at midnight) after the set.\"Cermak, who lives a train ride away in Deerfield, stood planted at the barricade for 8 straight hours -- his only sustenance, once his water was gone, was the free beer someone tossed him from the V.I.P. section behind the barricade.His story is hardly unique. Over the weekend other dedicated fans would pour in to the festival grounds, braving the heat to wait at stages for their favorite performers.Alyssa Gyorkos, a 24-year-old artist from Logan Square, waited at the Grant Park Stage for Arctic Monkeys' 8:45 p.m. set Thursday for three hours with her friend Anna Rodimtseva. Gyorkos says she \"only braved the hell that can be the loud EDM (electronic dance) stages at Lollapalooza\" for her beloved band. She's been to Lollapalooza once before, in 2014, to see the Arctic Monkeys the last time they headlined the festival.Gyorkos has been a fan since the beginning of their career in 2006, she says. \"I appreciate a band that sounds just as good live as they do on their record,\" Gyorkos says. \"Alex Turner may not have as exciting a stage presence as other acts, but based on videos of their recent performances ... he's definitely found his hips.\"Being a superfan doesn't come without challenges. During Scott's set, someone crowd-surfed a garbage can over Cermak's head. \"It was still full of garbage,\" he says. Gyorkos and Rodimtseva couldn't push their way through the crowd to use the bathroom as they waited.Mia Recchia, 19, traveled two hours from Huntley to see Bruno Mars perform Friday night at the Grant Park stage. \"You know those slim, circle iPods they had in 2009? That's how long I've been a dedicated Bruno Mars fan,\" Recchia says.Recchia took up her barricade station at 1 p.m. to see Mars' 8:30 p.m. set. She's seen the singer live once, at Tinley Park in 2014. \"But there's no way to prepare for the set,\" she says. \"The light show, the dance moves, his voice ... it sounds amazing man, it gets me.\" As a budding singer, Recchia says Mars' songs are her go-to for practicing and his success serves as constant inspiration for her own career.Being a superfan at one of the hottest, loudest music festivals takes energy, patience and a strong bladder. But according to Cermak, for whom this was his first concert, it makes the Lollapalooza experience all the more memorable. \"I'd brave the crowds again for him (Scott) ... it was unforgettable,\" he says.msmith@chicagotribune.comMORE FROM LOLLAPALOOZA:___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "796"}
{"content": "Aug. 01--Since the White Sox drafted Zack Collins in the first round of the 2016 draft, his knack for getting on base has been his signature, and his patient approach has been a refreshing sight for an organization with its share of free swingers.As Collins has begun to figure out the Double A level this season, he has his eyes are set on accomplishing a feat no White Sox player has in 20 years.\"I'd love to lead the big leagues in walks and on-base (percentage),\" Collins said.The Sox's top catching prospect is leading the minor leagues in walks (87), on-base percentage (.408), and walk rate (21 percent) and sported a career-high .833 OPS in his first 96 games for Double-A Birmingham this season.\"Zack is one of those hitters that when you challenge him to do something, he has it set in his mind that he's going to do it,\" said Birmingham Barons manager Ryan Newman. \"I absolutely think that is a goal that he can reach with his ability.\"The last White Sox player to lead the majors in on-base percentage was Frank Thomas in 1997 (.456), the Hall of Famer's third and last time doing it during his 16-year career with the White Sox. Thomas also led the league in walks four times.\"People always ask me about my approach. In my opinion, your eyes aren't perfect enough to (only) look for the outside pitch or the inside pitch,\" Collins said. \"So I look for something I can drive and if it's not there, I don't swing.\"\"Sometimes I let pitches go that look drivable because they aren't perfect and that's just part of it. It happens. Guys are throwing nasty pitches. Guys are throwing hard. When you're looking for the perfect pitch, sometimes it doesn't work out.\"As a hitting instructor himself before joining the White Sox organization, Newman would see young hitters struggle to toe the line of patience and aggressiveness. Watching his catcher's ability to do that in just his third professional season has impressed him.\"It's an exceptional eye in such a young hitter,\" Newman said. \"Zack has a well-above-average knowledge of the strike zone. When he was struggling earlier in the season, he was actually too selective. When he expanded, not the strike zone, but what he wanted to hit, that's when he really took off. He looks comfortable.\"The University of Miami product went back to his old stance because of a lack of comfort. Despite his .248 batting average, combining his patient approach with his old stance, the numbers have proven the change to be effective. He has doubled his line drive percentage to 26 percent, which has translated to consistent success at the plate.Collins offensive prowess may get him to the big leagues, but the progress he makes on the defensive side may determine how soon that promotion comes. White Sox catchers have ranked 29th or worse in defensive runs saved the last three seasons and they have been one of baseball's worst pitch framing teams in 2018.\"I've seen some comments made about (my defense) that I took to heart. I'm looking to get better at every aspect of my game,\" he said. \"Hopefully I can help the big league team in Chicago soon.\"rdorseysports@gmail.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "797"}
{"content": "This is a way-too-early preview of the 2018 Big Ten Championship and which teams could meet in Indianapolis, including Michigan State football.There are several factors to take into consideration for which two teams will meet for the Big Ten Championship. The health of players, depth chart changes, and any departures that could take place would all affect this prediction.Schedule breaks as well as pundits watching teams go through the tough Big Ten schedule or the gauntlet. Whatever team emerges from the West and East divisions they will be battle-tested.Contenders from the WestThe contenders I like are Iowa, Northwestern and Wisconsin. I believe Nebraska is still a year away from challenging although with a coach like Scott Frost, who knows. Minnesota is still becoming competitive and probably at least two years away. Iowa is a dark horse of this bunch but could make it if they could put everything together. They get Northwestern and Wisconsin at Kinnick Stadium and that is a huge advantage. They also return Nathan Staley to a solid team.Northwestern also returns its starting quarterback in Clayton Thorson but it has lost running back Justin Jackson to the NFL. The Wildcats have an easy road with Nebraska at home as well as Wisconsin and Michigan. However, they travel to Iowa late in the year for a big-time showdown.Iowa and Northwestern are excellent teams and both are fully capable of taking that next step to go to Indy. However, Wisconsin is stacked with talent and will end up being the representative of the West. The Badgers bring back their entire offensive line and Jonathan Taylor. This was one of the better offensive lines last year and they have only gotten better.Northwestern or Iowa does not have the defense yet to slow the Badgers down. Both of those games will be difficult for Wisconsin but they will end up being the representative from the West. If quarterback Alex Hornibrook could take another step forward in his development, this team could contend for a College Football Playoff spot. However, Hornibrook has a slow release and it will be interesting to watch if that improves during the season.", "id": "798"}
{"content": "Fear The Walking Dead returns shortly for the second half of season 4 and a new teaser hints that Morgan might be heading back to The Walking Dead world.TV Guide has an exclusive teaser for  season 4B that indicates Morgan might be heading back to the communities that he left at the end of  season 8. Alicia appears to be out on her own killing walkers. She\u2019s drawing walkers on a solo mission when Morgan finds her.Morgan is concerned about her, and he tells her that he is heading back east to the place where he came from. That means Morgan is heading back towards Alexandria, The Hilltop, and The Kingdom. He tells Alicia that she should come too. Since she seems to be on a mission to help others Morgan tells her that she could do a lot of good back among the survivors that he knows. And she could. She is a capable fighter and a leader, like her mother was. But Alicia seems determined to finish whatever mission she is.Morgan is worried about her killing walkers on her own, especially since she\u2019s deliberately seeking them out. When he tells her that she could get hurt out there on her own it\u2019s hard not to think about Carl and what happened to him. He and Siddiq were together and he still got bit, so Alicia is definitely playing with fire to seek out groups of walkers to kill. You can watch the teaser here.Will Morgan Go Back To ?Morgan says that he is leaving for the other communities in the morning. But, that doesn\u2019t mean he will actually get there. Thanks to the creative use of time in this season we don\u2019t know when this exchange between Morgan and Alicia takes place. Is it before the big storm? If it is then Morgan could be delayed by the hurricane or he could end up in a situation that makes him abandon his plans to return to the communities.It would be interesting to see what the survivors would make of Alicia. But with the coming time jumps in season 9 it would be difficult for the two shows to line up again to allow more crossovers to happen.The only reason that Morgan\u2019s timeline met up with the timeline this season was because of the time jump in that was part of the rebooting of the story. With going through it\u2019s own reboot further crossovers in the present time are doubtful.Other CrossoversThat doesn\u2019t mean that fans won\u2019t see characters that are dead on timeline appear in the timeline thanks to Althea\u2019s tapes. In the first half of season 4 there were several tapes in Althea\u2019s collection that could have belonged to some of survivors like Abe, Rosita, and Eugene. There was also a tape that could be Daniel Salazar\u2019s.It was confirmed that Daniel Salazar would return in season 4 but so far he has not appeared. Maybe he will be appearing on one of Althea\u2019s tapes. More answers will be revealed very soon when returns for season 4B on August 12th on AMC.", "id": "799"}
{"content": "July 27--Q: Your neighbors have a newborn whose crying keeps you up. What do you say to the parents?A: Unless you are a trained baby nurse who can teach these parents how to console their little one with expert advice on diaper changes, feeding and swaddling, you may have to grin and bear this stage.Most parents are like deer in the headlights when dealing with a newborn. They may not have the faintest idea how to stop their baby from crying. They're exhausted, overwhelmed and trying to catch a wink of sleep, just like you.Have a heart, plug in your headphones and put on some soothing music to block out the noise. When you see your neighbors, rather than list your complaints, offer to lend a hand. Make a homemade meal, inquire if you can baby-sit so they can sneak away for a quick bite out, or take the baby for a stroll during the day.These kind gestures may endear you to the family, so you won't even notice the crying in the future.-- Lisa Gache, founder &amp; CEO of Beverly Hills MannersA: In the midst of confrontation, understanding and levity might be the change-makers here. Say something like, \"I understand you've got a new addition to the family. Congratulations! I know a new baby can be so stressful, and I hate to add to your burden, but we are early risers, and the crying keeps us up at night. What can we do about this?\"If the parents offer nothing, I suggest trying what a client of mine used with her neighbors. She said, \"I think it would work better if you put the baby into the second bedroom (furthest from her). I really value you as neighbors, and I truly don't want this to escalate.\"When her neighbors made the move, my client left cookies for them and a stuffed animal for the baby, outside their door.-- John Duffy, parenting and relationship expertSocial Graces is a weekly series asking two experts for advice on awkward situations.chrjohnson@tronc.com___(c)2018 the Chicago TribuneVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.comDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "id": "800"}
