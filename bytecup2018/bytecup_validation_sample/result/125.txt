When I look into your eyesIt’s like watching the night skyOr a beautiful sunriseWell, there’s so much they holdAnd just like them old starsI see that you’ve come so farTo be right where you areHow old is your soul?Well, I won’t give up on usEven if the skies get roughI’m giving you all my loveI’m still looking upAnd when you’re needing your spaceTo do some navigatingI’ll be here patiently waitingTo see what you find‘Cause even the stars they burnSome even fall to the earthWe’ve got a lot to learnGod knows we’re worth itNo, I won’t give upI don’t wanna be someone who walks away so easilyI’m here to stay and make the difference that I can makeOur differences they do a lot to teach us how to useThe tools and gifts we got, yeah, we got a lot at stakeAnd in the end, you’re still my friend at least we did intendFor us to work we didn’t break, we didn’t burnWe had to learn how to bend without the world caving inI had to learn what I’ve got, and what I’m not, and who I amI won’t give up on usEven if the skies get roughI’m giving you all my loveI’m still looking up, I’m still looking up
